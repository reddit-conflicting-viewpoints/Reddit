# key takeaways

russia's invasion of ukraine caused the manifestation of china's worst fears:


* **china's long-term strategy to divide west ruined; its regional situation worsened.**

* the west, its allies, and even the typically-neutral have reacted swiftly, firmly, cohesively. 

* peripheral states (e.g. finland, sweden) given impetus to join west. 

* similar banding by states in asia now more likely. 

&nbsp;

* **china placed in diplomatic lose-lose situation.**

* weeks before, announced russian friendship ""without limits"", desire to change global order; invasion not during beijing olympics. 

* widely perceived to have at least enabled invasion. worried about looking more culpable to west and suffering similar consequences during a critical period for their development.

* must avoid looking like an insincere partner while not incurring wrath of west. increased headwinds and crosswinds regardless.

&nbsp;

* **regardless of ukraine's outcome, china's longer-term outlook much worse off.**

* running out of time due to demographic crises, climate change, critical resource shortages (water), end of growth spurt, festering financial malaise. these converge in a few decades. 

* country and military not developed enough right now so would rather bide for another decade or so to reach golden window of opportunity (relative power) before confronting current order. invasion creates more friction against development, brings controntation forward.
 
* gains from russian victory completely overshadowed by awakening and hardening of west and allies and regional banding. russia's stability in question due to sanctions.

* ukrainian victory means further instability for russia on top of strengthening confidence in current global order.

* either way, increased political headwinds due to perception of at least some culpability in invasion. viability of russia as long-term insurance against issues mentioned jeopardized due to chance of regime change. if it overtly shuts down a pro-west change, west will strike very hard. worst-case: russia becomes part of west.


&nbsp;

* **due to all of the above, covert action to escalate the conflict between russia and the west would be in china's favor, even if it causes some damage to self, as geopolitics at this level is about relative victories.**

* dual-circulation and zero-tolerance policies in-place provide groundwork for further insulation.

* putin portrayed as unstable and underhanded, with his nuclear forces armed, and the country cornered by sanctions--fertile ground for covert instigation. no speculation on form of covert instigation as too many options and too early to say. 

* some other countries have similar motivations, but it is the most motivated and capable.

* direct intervention: very unlikely to assist ukraine invasion; likely to try to prop up putin or maintain favorable regime.

# ""crisis: danger and opportunity"" - china's geopolitical opportunity in the ukraine invasion

&nbsp;

after lamenting for years the disunity displayed by the west and its allies on a wide range of issues, the swiftness, determination, and cohesion in their reactions to the ukraine invasion is relieving; even touching. however, the economic asphyxiation of russia has only just begun, and there is no telling what a cornered beast might do, and how third parties might take advantage of this perception to play both sides. the latent danger lurking below the surface might be greater than most, even on /r/geopolitics, realize. this conflict is the biggest opportunity in a generation for some states to reverse their flagging fortunes at the expense of the feuding factions and everyone else, and both russia and the west would do well to be on guard against this. as there is no shortage of pundits discussing the threat of opportunistic provocateurs, this short article will focus on analyzing one major power's potential motivations and touch on the opportunities presented by the unfolding situation.

&nbsp;

putin's actions caused the materialization of china's worst fears. on top of uniting, galvanizing, and even growing the west, it placed china in a diplomatic lose-lose situation and jeopardized its long-term insurance by making a russian regime change a distinct possibility. in my view, virtually all unattended outcomes of this conflict do not bode well for its long-term future.

&nbsp;

a prevailing russia would lead some neighboring countries to question the point of the west and fall deeper into russia's orbit while shaking global confidence in the post-wwii order. though in line with the ccp's goals, the benefits are completely overshadowed by the strategic costs of binding and hardening the west's resolve--something that has been their core strategy for many years. a ukrainian victory would further strain russia while having the opposite effect of strengthening the current order. whatever ukraine's fate, the world is left with perceptions that china had, at the very least, unwittingly enabled the invasion, and this on its own can have consequences. the fact the invasion began soon after beijing's olympics does not help, as military plans do not typically yield for sporting events; neither does their declaration of friendship ""without limits"" that would build a new global order at the start of the event. given what is at stake for the current order, it would mean stronger headwinds from more directions at a critical period. realizing this, beijing is desperately trying to walk a fine line to avoid being seen as russia's enabler or branded a fickle, undependable partner; dancing around in crosswinds, desperately holding on to its fig leaf of credibility. its foreign ministry, known for its combative wolf warrior diplomacy that at one point caused the pla to tell xi that [it would not ""pay the bill""](/), has been reduced to a troupe of tightrope walkers and contortionists, with putin as the eccentric ringmaster.

&nbsp;

zooming out to the bigger picture: from their perspective, they would want to bide another decade or so since china is still fragile and vulnerable, especially relative to members of the order it openly seeks to topple as the country and its military are not yet mature. they probably planned to assert themselves most during their golden window of opportunity, but the confrontation was brought forward by the invasion. this would be a major headache on its own, but there is more: the ccp know their age of growth will soon be over; replaced by an age of climate change, demographic crises (plural), and critical resource shortages (water)--to say nothing of the festering financial ills being exacerbated by the zero-tolerance policy it is stuck with. these seem set to converge within a few decades at most, and then it would be as if the universe was collecting on its biggest debt. things will be rough, but at least there is a friendly northern neighbor that can be counted on to act as a like-minded strategic ally, a massive land buffer, and a source of cheap, accessible, dependable natural resources (including water). or so it was thought.

&nbsp;

one possible consequence of this war is a regime change--a possibility reserved not just for ukraine, but also for its invader. with russia being economically decimated by sanctions and putin's oligarchs getting stripped, the stage has been set for putin's departure; and with this comes the possibility of an overhaul in governance and allegiances. in my view, one of the few things stopping russia from joining the west [is its leadership](/). its people, caucasian and culturally christian, naturally gravitate towards the west--at least, more so than to china. i have [for years](/) thought about a russian regime change as being one of the lower hanging fruits for dealing with china, all stemming from basic [research](/) done [much earlier](/), and this seems to be the future we are now heading toward. there is little the ccp can do to prevent this regime change once things go past the tipping point, as the west and its allies, now roused, would come down hard --very hard-- on any such attempt. if russia follows its current trajectory unmolested and flips to the west, the ccp's future becomes that much more grim.

&nbsp;

the chinese term for 'crisis' contains two words: 'danger' followed by 'opportunity'. the ccp knows it is in a bind and would be looking to make a move while the window of opportunity remains open.  a scenario that is better than the unattended alternatives is to come out on top, *relatively speaking*. despite its growth having been derived from global trade, the country has been increasingly insular with its dual circulation strategy and zero-tolerance policy, so if the conflict between russia and the west were to intensify without pulling in china (note the word use of the word 'conflict' instead of 'war'; not necessarily kinetic), that would be in its net favor. it is already under a lot of scrutiny and would want to avoid sanctions, so it must act covertly. and to a covert provocateur, the current situation would look like a buffet: a strongman characterized as unstable, cornered by sanctions; his country reputed to be underhanded, its nuclear forces on standby; the media in a frenzy, the internet rife with lies. all this within the first week of war, which could morph into years of resistance, while economic measures mature. basically, the options range from ""manipulation of public discourse"" to ""economic shenanigans"" to ""false flag"" to ""suitcase nuke"" and combinations of everything in between, with proxies and intermediaries throwing off investigations just long enough.

&nbsp;  

with motive and opportunity established, people typically turn to the means to complete the triad, but i will not, simply because any speculation would just be creative writing since the possibilities are endless. i can, however, say with some confidence what *will not* happen: china will not meddle in ukraine--providing funding and/or weapons to increase russia's odds in ukraine does little for its big picture while overt and costly. it is not so much ukraine's fate that is china's concern, but russia's. if anything they would try to prop up putin, his regime, or an amicable successor's.

&nbsp;

i am sure there are other states to which the logic presented in this short article also applies --they might even have stronger motivations and opportunities-- but within this subset of potential opportunists, it is china that is most motivated and poised. hopefully all parties will remain vigilant, clear-eyed, and level-headed.

**bloomberg: on wednesday, the un general assembly voted to condemn russia for its invasion of ukraine and demanded it withdraw its forces. china abstained from that vote. does the foreign ministry have a comment on why china abstained from that vote?**

wang wenbin: ambassador zhang jun, permanent representative of china to the un, already made an explanation of the vote. 

china’s basic position on the ukraine issue is consistent and clear. we always advocate respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and peaceful resolution of international disputes based on the purposes and principles of the un charter.

i am wondering whether this will upset his own power base.

the reasons for this are as follows:

the richest people in russia control a lot of the former state owned industries.

however for tax purposes, mr oligarch does not hold the shares in their own names.

instead they use cyprus and other offshore tax havens for registering holding companies.

vladimir lisin, vladimir potanin, viktor rashnikov all have cyprus holding companies.  these are just the first ones that came up on google.  i did not perform an exhaustive search. 

and what is more, despite not being nato, cyprus joined the swift ban.

9,t5hkt5,A Boycott of China Might Save Ukraine,,5,0.86,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t5hkt5/a_boycott_of_china_might_save_ukraine/,2,"**why china?**

russia invaded ukraine in spite of obvious prospects for western sanctions.  this means russia must have believed it can maintain its core economic interests in spite of invading ukraine and triggering sanctions.  russia continuing the invasion after initial missteps and hardships confirms this view.

first we should understand russia's economic interests.  the russian economy is not self-sufficient, or even close to it.  they need markets for raw resources and energy, and they need to import products they cannot produce.  as an example, it is worth considering semiconductors.  russia does not have significant domestic modern chip fabrication\[1\], and this is a difficult industry to establish.  it is impossible to run a modern military or consumer economy without access to chips.

what we can infer from russia's decision to invade is that they have assurances from at least one outside party that secure its core economic interests (including, but not limited to semiconductors) in spite of widespread sanctions from the rest of the world.  with japan, s. korea, taiwan, and the united states all sanctioning russia, the most obvious implication is a secret protocol with china.  us sanctions ostensibly preclude even chinese manufacturers from exporting to russia, but the us has limited ability to monitor and enforce this ban within china's borders.

further confirming this picture is recent evidence that china and russia discussed the timing of the invasion in advance. \[2\] 

the most obvious things china would have to gain in such an arrangement today is access to russia's resources and support in the event of an eventual chinese invasion of taiwan.  such an arrangement would have a historical parallel in the molotov-ribbentrop pact, when the ussr and nazi germany forged a secret agreement to divide up poland.  putin has obviously not learned from his country's past experience hitching its future to that of an ascendant regime engaged in genocide: an evil partner might not be reliable.

&#x200b;

**governments will not sanction china, but individuals can**

it is unlikely that world governments will move against china.  the postwar global order is built on norms, and these norms protect us.  putin's russia has abrogated norms around naked invasion, but others hold.  just as in korea, vietnam, afghanistan, and other conflicts, ukraine is becoming a proxy war that does not risk triggering use of nuclear weapons.

putin and xi correctly calculate that china, under the traditional rules of international diplomacy, has a good deal of latitude to help russia evade sanctions.  critically, sanctions require broad participation to be effective.  even if a few countries sanction china, it will be difficult to build a broad international consensus around this so long as china is not directly and obviously involved in killing civilians in ukraine.

the global community of internet-connected individuals does not abide by any such rules.  to whatever extent people around the world can be convinced that china's genocidal regime is sheltering russia from experiencing economic consequences beyond its demonstrated capacity to tolerate, they can come together to impose sanctions on china notwithstanding lack of will among traditional political elites.

&#x200b;

**what a realistic boycott looks like**

it is impossible to completely cut off china from global trade.  as we have seen in the course of the pandemic, china is too deeply embedded in global supply chains.  however, it is realistic to cut china off from the top of the value chain.  finished goods, which tend to carry the highest margins, are relatively easy to identify as having come from china.

one policy people can demand is strengthening country of origin laws to make it easier to identify where products were manufactured.  especially online, it can be difficult to tell where your purchase is coming from.  but this is also something people could take direct action on.  for example, many sites have user reviews, q&a, and comment sections where this information can be directly published by users.

&#x200b;

**china may be vulnerable**

china's communist party has long had a de-facto bargain with the population: the party delivers economic growth, and the people surrender freedoms.  china is at a dangerous point where growth may be slowing, and the regime is starting to pivot to prioritize a capability for unprecedent totalitarian control over the control. \[3\]  xi is personally ascendant, and has unusual power even for a chinese president and party chairman.

however, that is all true in the context of economic growth gained through global economic engagement.  expectations of accelerating prosperity die hard, and china has not experienced true economic disaster in many decades.  as we have learned in recent days, when a longheld expectation is shattered, what becomes politically possible shifts extremely rapidly.

destroy xi's aura of economic invulnerability before he further consolidates power, and china might divert from its current path of entrenching a genocidal strongman.  alternatively, pressuring china merely to abandon trade with russia could be the last straw forcing russia to withdraw in ukraine while enhancing prospects for long-term independence of taiwan.

even assuming a secret pact, china has surprisingly little to lose in abandoning russia.  china's portfolio of material sourcing interests is broad and diverse, extending far beyond siberia.  russia's market is not very large, and shrinking.  chinese credibility is not much hampered by violating a secret protocol because the protocol is secret.  the only party that could expose them is russia, which is unique among nations in the extent to which it has weaponized lies in service of its foreign policy.  regarding its future ambitions in taiwan, china might discount how much it can count on current assurances from russia, in light of russia's past assurances to respect ukraine's territorial integrity. \[4\]

it is likely that any credible threat of a global boycott could deter china from helping russia evade sanctions.

15,t47ha0,Hypothetical geopolitical consequences of a post-Putin Russia,Discussion,193,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t47ha0/hypothetical_geopolitical_consequences_of_a/,90,"greetings r/geopolitics, with both oligarchs and average civilians now openly opposing putin (very publicly as well), one of the scenarios that could potentially play out is some form of governmental change in russia, be it a coup from generals worried putin will take them past the point of no return, or a civil uprising, or anywhere in between.  


what i would like to discuss with the sub-reddit is what this could potentially mean for both russia and the rest of the world going forward. a couple of scenarios that have occurred to me:

* military coup - generals take over, in which case ceasefire is declared with ukraine in order to pull troops back to deal with any civil disobedience whilst the transition period takes place. we could then see a return to reasonable normality on the wider stage with russia still aligned against the west and looking to gain support from china
* civil democratic uprising - dissent at home gains too much momentum to suppress, putin is removed forcefully through whatever means and elections are held. the obvious candidate with public support is navalny (assuming he survives). this would be the outcome that could shake up the world stage. if the west supports a fledgling democracy in russia, along with economic and diplomatic incentives, we could see the security situation in europe significantly improve. perhaps if it lasts it would pave the way for russia to join the eu once criteria are met. with a more docile russia, we could see a dramatic shift of focus towards the south china sea and asian region from the west. perhaps this spotlight would be enough to dissuade china from its expansionist posturing, or maybe it would make them feel threatened enough to commit to larger military expenditure.

obviously this is all speculation and if it falls outside the parameters of the subreddit then mods feel free to remove it, but its been something that has been in the back of my mind and i would love to hear some different takes on it. also if anybody has some recent literature on the matter that would be greatly appreciated too",1646139875.0,"['greeting', 'r/geopolitics', ',', 'oligarch',

17,t3x39p,Does mutually assured destruction really exist for non-nuclear NATO countries?,Discussion,104,0.88,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t3x39p/does_mutually_assured_destruction_really_exist/,82,"very unrealistically, let us say putin decides to take over poland (or any other nato country near russia, this is just an example) by nuking their capital, killing the government and many civilians. what is left of the country surrenders. 

now, given that only the us, uk, and france have their own nukes, i have slight doubt whether any of them would retaliate effectively. i know nato would force them to, but when the literal end nears i fear that the rules suddenly become very flexible. 

in short, i think mutually assured destruction is not so assured for nato countries without nuclear weapons, because:

1. they do not want to unleash ww3 and the end of the world, because “you do not start ww3 if you do not retaliate.” i know it would already have started, but what if nato is too soft? “putin taking some nato countries is better than the end of the world.”

2. i wonder whether the liberal progressive western countries have the guts to make an equal retaliation (by nuking civilians) for a far-away nato country. what i doubt here is whether there will really be eye-for-an-eye, or whether the nato states will nuke some wasteland or tactical positions, and call it a day. 

what do you think?

19,t3i2y1,"According to maritime law, can a country ban another from entering its territorial waters? Spain had proposed to ban Russian ships from EU territorial waters. Would that mean that Russian trade vessels wouldn't be able to enter the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea from the Atlantic?",Question,290,0.98,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t3i2y1/according_to_maritime_law_can_a_country_ban/,43,"the spanish government has proposed to ban russian vessels from eu territorial waters:

>the spanish government has proposed to the rest of the member countries of the european union the closure of eu seaports to ships flying the russian flag or those with russian capital in response to the invasion of ukraine. the measure, in the study phase, contemplates the prohibition of the supply of fuel and the supply of food. moncloa is also studying denying the access of russian ships or ships owned by russian companies to spanish waters. [source](-02-28/el-gobierno-propone-cerrar-los-puertos-de-la-ue-a-los-barcos-rusos.html)

it is not possible to cross the gibraltar strait without crossing spanish territorial waters. the same happens in the baltic sea: it is not possible to exit it without passing through swedish or danish waters (both in the eu).

based on this, **i have two questions**:

1. **does maritime law allow for spain, sweden or denmark to completely block those straits to trade vessels?**
2. **how much would it hurt russia?** \`this would completely block the port of saint petersburg and shut down all russian maritime trade from the black sea. i would force vessels wanting to exit or enter the black sea to border africa and go through the suez canal, but it would not impede their movement, only slow it.

29,t1ltng,Is a militarized Germany the answer to an aggressive Russia?,Discussion,71,0.8,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t1ltng/is_a_militarized_germany_the_answer_to_an/,171,"i think there are some serious issues with nato, or, more precisely european-american cooperation. the us is clearly the most powerful and influential member of nato, and this presents a couple of problems. because the us military dwarfs those of europe, europe free rides on american defense, and does not arm itself as much as it otherwise would (or used to). this was a really good thing when the american public was committed to the cold war and fighting communism. but today, it is harder to justify an american war in europe.the us will always be far away from the threats on the ground, and because of it, it is more difficult to justify us intervention. will there be widespread support for a war to defend estonia? i doubt it. so there is a kind of moral hazard issue where the us ""crowds out"" stronger european militaries, but the conflicts would be at their doorstep.

russian aggression is very real now. biden said he hopes to recreate the ussr. i am sure putin would love to go for the baltic states and poland. the baltic states are all in the eu. if russia attacked them, he would not just be attacking *estonia*; he would be attacking *europe*. i would love for there to be a european/eu military. both macron and merkel have mentioned this.

germany is by far the richest country in europe, and is the second most populated country after russia. as history has shown us, it can be the strongest country in europe when it wants to be. if germany spent 2% of gdp on defense (which is pretty modest for a developed country), it would spend, in total, about twice as much as russia. people need a leader. if a european army were formed, germany would have to take the initiative. and if a european army were not formed, germany could still make an immense difference if it ""remilitarized.""

i do not know too much about the shape of the bundeswehr, but i doubt it is ready to take on russia. i also do not know too much about german politics, but i get the sense that the country is quite pacifist and left-wing, which is great for peaceful times, but putin has clearly changed things. could germany be amenable to this? is it at all feasible?

also do not start saying, ""look at world war two if you want to see what a militarized germany."" the country is free and democratic, and i have no doubt it can be trusted.

30,t0y1zu,Are the Baltic countries next?,Question,78,0.74,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t0y1zu/are_the_baltic_countries_next/,64,"so, with ukraine already anout to be usurped by russia and probably turned into a satellite state with a puppet government), russia will have secured some but not all if the key geography it needs to get back to soviet level security.

it is probably happy in the east with its new chinese ally and kazakhstan / mongolia as buffer zones. it has pockets of georgia and crimea to guard the south and the black sea / caspian. the next logical move is to push through the baltics.

trouble is, latvia, lithuania, estonia and poland are all nato members who are already consulting under article 4 as they fear what i do.

my question is, would putin dare to take them and have a hot war with nato?

on one hand - it would be nuts. nato has nukes and is a formidable alliance. it will not just roll over.

on the other hand, the baltic countries are geographically vulnerable, small and expendable members of nato and putin understands that nato is not a united entity, so he could roll the dice, particularly given that by then, the world would have probably kicked him off swift and closed down nordstrom 1 along with any other economic contact. additionally, due to covid, most western economies are heavily indebted and cannot really afford war. that is part of why ukraine has been hung out to dry. its too hard to fight.

what would it accomplish? basically it would have russia feel mostly secure since 1991. it would probably buy them another decade as a single political entity (until demographic decline kills it off). it would also boost russia's nationalist sentiment and putin's legacy (i am sure hes enough of an egomaniac to think like this). 

what would it lose? well at that point, assuming no nuclear war due to mad doctrine (and i know this is a big assumption), i would say there would not be much beyond human lives lost (which is nothing

32,t0k28j,China's Maximum,Perspective,122,0.93,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t0k28j/chinas_maximum/,115,"in *the tragedy of great power politics,* john mearsheimer discusses the latent power that might have been present in multiple of the us' geopolitical rivals throughout history. the us intervened against germany, japan, and russia/soviet union all in order to discourage their ascendant hegemony over their chosen regions; however, he seems to imply that the 'latent power' within any one of these potential rivals was never altogether that great, certainly never more than the us.

he contrasts this with china. the 'latent power' of china might in fact be very great -- much greater than any former geopolitical rival of the united states. if the whole of china came on par with the gdp/capita of hong kong, for example, they would possess an unprecedented economic power, perhaps greater in relative terms than the us at its height after world war 2. it is a common point of discussion here to refer to a chinese desire to dominate east asia, but if china were to attain a gdp/capita such as that within only a few decades, they could easily possess over a fifty-percent share of the entire world's gdp -- at which point world hegemony might follow almost naturally. and according to mearshimer's offensive realism, if global hegemony is in any state actors grasp, they will strive to attain it -- whatever is commonly said about the limits of chinese ambitions currently residing solely in east asia notwithstanding.

however, clearly, it is possible, perhaps likely, that china might not be on such a trajectory as to eclipse the rest of the world's economy unto itself. they certainly have a massive population and are experiencing massive growth, but there are doubts as to how long that both of those aspects of their current advantages are to last. many, perhaps hopefully or wishfully, but perhaps instead realistically, claim that china will in fact very soon experience serious and long-term setbacks that would prevent them from even approaching the gdp/capita of some of the richer nations of the world. but even a doubling of the gdp/capita (as has already occurred in the last eleven years) to rival that of lithuania for example, would have massive geopolitical consequences.

my question to you is then this: what is the 'latent power' of china? what do we think are the realistic limits of china's growth and power? i am skeptical of many of the common predictions of imminent demographic crisis, for example: china has demonstrated an incredible agility in recent years to work its way around such problems. with this in mind, where do we honestly believe this current almost astronomical rise of chinese power ends? what does a world look like that contends with a china that has a 20,000 dollar gdp/capita, which if it possessed today would constitute 30 percent of the world economy? a 40,000 gdp/capita, that currently of hong kong, which would mean a 60 percent chinese possession of the world economy?",1645733205.0,"['*', 'tragedy', 'great', 'power',

36,sznk8s,Many people call Vladimir Putin a great geopolitical strategist and believe that the crisis in Eastern Europe will bring significant benefits to Russia. But there are 5 reasons why Putin's role in Ukraine could end up weakening Russia's position in the world.,Perspective,171,0.87,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sznk8s/many_people_call_vladimir_putin_a_great/,63,"first, before confronting the west, putin had to establish a long-term partnership with china. xi jinping gladly accepted, but it was the chinese leader who defined the terms of the highly asymmetrical relationship. putin had to accept being beijing's junior partner.

second, the crisis strengthens those in europe who advocate diversifying partners and investing in renewable energy to reduce dependence on russian energy. this may take time, but putin's actions will strengthen the european energy transition and reduce russian bargaining power. the german government's decision to suspend the activation of the nord stream 2 gas pipeline - which connects the country to russia - in reaction to russian recognition of donetsk and luhansk has shown that berlin is far less resistant to accepting western punishment than many thought.

thirdly, there is no doubt that russia has the means to keep ukraine unstable in order to easily control it, or even occupy it. but it will not be possible to eliminate ukrainian nationalism. ukraine, even controlled by moscow, will be a permanent point of tension that demands russian attention.

fourth, despite internal differences, the current russian strategy has made nato much stronger. in recent months, even finland and sweden have started debating whether to join the military alliance.

ultimately, an advance by russian troops into ukraine would likely lead to a us government decision to block semiconductor exports to russia, a decision that would greatly hinder russian attempts to diversify its economy.",1645639052.0,"['first', ',', 'confront', 'west', ',', 'putin', 'establish', 'long-term', 'partnership', 'china', '.', 'xi', 'jinping', 'gladly', 'accepted', ',', 'chinese',

38,szofnz,When Should States be able to Declare Independence? When Should they be able to be Recognised?,Perspective,101,0.9,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/szofnz/when_should_states_be_able_to_declare/,48,"**contradictions in statecraft**

on the 7th and 27th of april 2014 respectively, the donestk and luhansk people's republics declared independence from ukraine following a contested referendum after the maidan movement in which 89% of voters allegedly chose independence. nobody recognised the breakaway states at the time, though russia engaged in de facto relations with them.

on february 21st, 2022, russian president putin announced its recognition of the donetsk and luhansk people's republics. it then signed treaties of friendship with them and, on their invitation, moved troops into what is considered internationally to be part of eastern ukraine. this was widely condemned in the west as a breach of international law and an invasion of ukrainian territory-obviously, they did not recognise the independence of the l/dpr, who had declared independence unilaterally from ukraine. no states other than russia and no international organisations recognise their independence.

however, the politics of *how* a state is allowed to gain independence is unclear and contested in international politics. thus, so is the politics of *when* a state can be recognised. let us look to another example: kosovo. in 2008, the kosovan assembly proclaimed independence unilaterally from and against the will of serbia. this time, it was much of the west who recognised kosovan independence, with serbia and russia declaring it illegal. kosovo is not recognised by the un, but enjoys recognition by some international organisations and is recognised by just over 50% of un member states.

clearly, there is some contradiction in the policy of states as to *when* one can unilaterally declare independence. those who oppose each of these declarations claimed it was illegal, whereas those who supported it claimed it was legal under some framework or another. what does international law say on this matter?

**the law?**

when serbia referred the case of kosovo to the icj, the icj ruled that kosovo's declaration of independence *[was not](-cij.org/public/files/case-related/141/141-20100722-adv-01-00-en.pdf)* in violation of international law. it decided this, to oversimplify, because international law *does not* prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, because the kosovan assembly was deemed a legitimate representative of the people of kosovo, and because the territorial integrity of states only applies *between* states. some judges also argued that the failure of negotiations between belgrade and pristina as well as the abuses kosovo had faced under serbian rule made it legal, but that is not the consensus of the 10 icj judges who voted in favour of its legality. the question of whether this sets a precedent for international law *as a whole* is hotly debated among international legal experts and not something i intend to settle here. nonetheless, it is clear that the legal framework through which the icj accepted kosovo's declaration as valid *can* be transposed, at least in part, onto other situations, even if it cannot in full (as the us argues).

so, how does this translate to the d/lprs? i will not give an opinion in the op, but the question surely is whether:

-the d/lprs are representative of the people they claim to govern over.

-whether the d/lprs are independent, internal actors in ukraine (rather than it being a state-state violation of sovereignty).

the fact it was unilateral, according to the icj, is not a point against its legitimacy.

**the limits of the law**

of course, international law is not the most important thing in determining state behaviour. this ruling, whether or not it gives precedent, has not been consistently upheld by the international community, meaning it is not the basis of whether a group *can* declare independence.

i will give two examples: catalonia, and iraqi kurdistan.

both held referendums in 2017, legitimised by the catalan and krg parliaments (but not approved by the parent state), as to whether to go independent. in catalonia, the ""no"" side boycotted the vote, and so the result-which was 92% in favour-only had a 43% turnout. the krg referendum, by contrast, had a much higher turnout at 72%. 93% voted for independence.

the catalan parliament was freely and fairly elected and, although the krg parliament is only semi-democratic, the referendum showed a move to independence is still representative of popular opinion. even though the catalan referendum had below 50% turnout, as the kosovo case shows, you do not need a referendum for a representative parliament to be legally allowed to declare independence.

despite this, both were shut down by force and received no international recognition. so, when can states declare independence? is there any coherent logic beyond geopolitical interests?

**ethics/morality of declaring independence**

the final part is what you think we, as individuals, should think. when do you think it is ok to declare independence? when do you think it is ok for states to recognise a polity that has declared independence? this is a question beyond pure academic interest, considering public opinion influences state behaviour (unless you are a neorealist) in what putnam describes as a ""[two-level game](-content/uploads/2013/10/putnam-the-logic-of-two-level-games.pdf)"".

does it have to be in agreement with the parent state to be legitimate (as serbia, ukraine, spain, and iraq argued in our case studies)?

does the body declaring it have to either have support through a free + fair referendum or be democratically elected?

does it have to have the support of the international community?

do negotiations have to have failed?

39,sz7kgo,The optimistic argument for this week’s events in Ukraine and Russia.,Perspective,489,0.93,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sz7kgo/the_optimistic_argument_for_this_weeks_events_in/,175,"i am very pessimistic about these developments myself, and have been trying to find the best case for optimism to challenge my thinking. the most lucid optimistic argument comes from igor schatz in [this long twitter threat](). i have compiled it to readable form here. i am curious if anyone here sees major flaws with his reasoning. his basic is that putin’s bluff has been called and putin is now chained to an outcome he did not want. schatz’s comments in essay form below:

my 2 cents on putin’s decision today:

this is a strategic defeat for putin and a full-scale war is even less likely after today then before. let me explain in this thread. the primary goal of putin has been to subjugate ukraine and especially its foreign and defense policy to russian interests and priorities.

in essence the goal was to make ukraine into a vassal state, a la belarus where russia retains full political control and leverage and which is currently in the process of soft annexation. the primary tool to achieve this goal have been minsk protocol 2 which were signed in 2015 after a russian-military-led offensive on debaltseve, a small town in donbas but a major railway juncture. 

this agreement achieved a cease fire, a pow exchange and basically stopped the active phase of the conflicts. the protocol aimed at reintegrating the separatist part of donbas into ukraine proper but on the conditions drafted by separatists’ russian handlers. more specifically, putin’s focus on minsk 2 was on the part that would require ukraine to conduct a constitutional reform that would give the separatist region a special status that would allow it to veto any foreign and defense policy decisions. 

since separatists are just russian puppets and their leaders are in fact russian citizens ( the current one is even a member of putin’s party ), this would essentially give russian government a direct political control over ukraine, essentially eliminating its sovereignty for all intents and purposes. additionally, the protocol envisioned full amnesty to separatists many of which engaged in outright criminal activity and human rights abuses that would be on par with hamas. it also stipulated that the separatist militants would be renamed and remade into a local police with potential jurisdiction over the whole country, and it also put the region in charge of appointing its own judges and prosecutors, that of course would be drawn from the ranks of militants with the implicit advice and consent form kremlin. you can imagine the kind of justice that would be practiced by such judges and courts.. there was 0 chance that ukraine was going to accede to giving up its sovereignty, as it has had 0 political and civic support for obvious reasons.

the confidence game put on by putin that involved the massive show of force aimed at compelling ukraine or compelling the west to force ukraine to abandon its sovereignty via this backdoor maneuver. putin’s calculus was that the west is divided and weak, biden administration is weak especially since he canceled sanctions on ns2 in may and practically agreed at the geneva summit in june to do putin’s bidding on talking ukraine into minsk 2. 

putin also counted on destabilizing ukraine politically by keeping the threats of force, potentially leading to the fall of government and divided country that would lead to a friendlier regime that he could either control or even potentially install. all of these assumptions of putin were proven wrong… the west is united, and even putin’s attempt to send separate letters with same demands/proposals to different countries in a gambit to try and pick some off did not work.

instead he got one response from the eu directly basically telling him “buddy, why you wasting your time and printer paper sending your silly letters around when you can just send one directly to brussels which is where you going to get a single response from”. his progressive escalation also did not work on rattling ukrainians.. there was no panic in the country, the political leadership was united and showed amazing resilience and resolve and the army was disciplined not to respond to military provocations. 

putin kept escalating because inertia took over and because he assumed that credible threats of war (culminating with nuclear drills over the weekend) would scare soft europeans who do not want war and who are visiting the kremlin like never before. at the same time, the us has turned up its own info war which basically meant to say that a) we are not going to honor your ultimatums and b) we have seen your war threats and are ready for war if that is what you intend. 

the reaction from the ukrainian government was similar a) your demands to give up our sovereignty are unacceptable; b) we will talk about our aspirations to join nato louder because its our sovereign right to chose alliances we sign up for and c) we see your troops on our borders and hear your threats but we will not panic and we are confident in our army that acquired a lot of combat experience since 2014 ( i have seen a number of 400,000 of ukrainians with active combat experience ) and is highly motivated. meanwhile, the uk, canada, the us and a number of other nato countries have been sending plane loads of weapons to ukraine for weeks, on some days up to a dozen planes - to either help deter putin or help ukraine army defend the country more effectively. 

in the end, putin’s confidence game has failed, since he never planned on the actual war which would be costly in resources and lives and very risky since given ukraine’s resolve he would not achieve political aims even by military means, he does not have enough troops to control the country which is the 2nd largest in europe by territory and has a large population motivated to kill an invading force, and this adventure might even cost him his own regime at home.

the decision to recognize the separatist part of donbas today is probably the worst outcome for him and the best for ukraine: it buries minsk protocols, getting ukraine off the hook politically and preserves the status quo by freezing the conflict but in a favorable state: full responsibility for the area is shifted to russia, russian troops that are already present there would now merely operate actually wearing their uniforms and as such holding russia more accountable for what happens there while accelerating military and economic aid for ukraine as well as needed domestic reforms that would speed up the eventual path to the eu.  for putin, this is a strategic defeat because he lost minsk protocol as a tool for potential political leverage over ukraine.

ukraine is now more united, more anti-russia and on a faster path of spinning out of kremlin’s “sphere of influence”. why did putin go for this option ? well, faced with western and ukraine’s resolve in response to his ultimatums and what he thought were credible threats of force, but unwilling to make good on these threats (high five to the boys at langley for confronting his bluff in the information space) he also needed to save face and show a win for all his herculean confidence efforts. the win that he needed for this not so much to show to his domestic audience but to show to his own little circle of strongman that constitute his inner circle… because coming out of this as a loser in their eyes would basically dramatically shorten his reign.

the residual risks right now is that the separatists might want to expand their territorial control since they only control 1/3 of the administrative regions in donbas and claim domain over the whole admin region. while this is a risk, it does not seem highly likely since it would create a risk of a big war for putin that he was trying to avoid, since expanding territories controlled by “sovereign republics” does not score anything for putin politically while risking far harsher sanctions and bad optics of dead civilians that allegedly he wants to protect, etc.. this is probably a good time for him to consolidate and absorb mild sanctions from the west while doing his best to shift attention from this issue for now he is likely to come back with another attempt at ukraine at another time, but for now he knows he lost badly and its better to get attention away from this quickly to make sure the strongmen around him do not think too hard and realize the same. 

it is much better for him to focus on the ongoing soft annexation of belarus which i predicted a month ago. russian troops are not leaving after the end of planned exercises yesterday, and belarus is holding a constitutional referendum on the 27th. part of this constitutional reform calls for allowing belarus to host nuclear weapons on its territory (guess whose wink-wink), and if you followed belarus elections in august 2020, you would know that results of the referendum are preordained. 

so we will likely have permanent russian military bases and nukes on belarus territory shortly… look on the map and you will see that belarus is quite close to the center of europe.. this would be a legitimate win for putin and i think he would want to focus the attention of his entourage as well as homegamers watching state tv on a legitimate win and away from ukraine where he lost.. the small wild card is whether anti-lukashenko protests that were suppressed in 2020 will will resume if the people realize that their independence and sovereignty at stake in a country where lukashenko has little support and legitimacy.. mind you, lukashenko has always been independent-minded on behalf of his country and this is a new development. 

some final thoughts: why has putin decided to raise the stakes now.. i think covid is partially responsible.. during covid putin has been isolated and has narrowed his inner circle and the people he sees personally. just look at him meeting foreign leaders to refuse to submit to the anal-probe covid test at the opposite end of a 50 foot long table. 

my theory is that he is deadly afraid of covid partly because he has grown more paranoid, partly because he might be immune compromised based on reports of some severe illness he might have had in 2019 (unconfirmed), and also because he is not vaccinated and he has seen the severe death toll of the unvaxxed in russia. i am pretty confident that he is not vaccinated because he is too paranoid to allow himself to be injected with anything. 

because his inner circle likely narrowed to the hard liners, this also means that his sources of information and advice have narrowed and he likely only receives advice and info that he wants to see and/or that his entourage wants him to see. and he probably miscalculated in his assumptions that his confidence van would succeed because they were based on information that was not representative of reality. my theory also explains why his speech today was so unhinged. he came across extremely angry, but mainly because he has lost and he had to resort to the option in his arsenal that he was not really planning on using.

to summarize: putin played a high confidence game to compel the west to new world order and to compel ukraine to loss of sovereignty and lost. there will not be a full-scale war (though limited confrontation in the east ukraine is still very much on the table). but there also will not be a big deescalation, though i think we will see some troop drawdown shortly since he cannot keep the troops idle for too long living in tents in the middle of the russian winter end. 

basically, if putin was serious about a full-scale invasion he would not need the theater of recognizing the separatist “republics” first; he also would have had the state prepare the nation for war through months-long war propaganda - which was not happening … putin thought he was going around open-carrying in massachusetts but realized that he is in texas instead... so he had to resort to grabbing a misplaced wallet and retreating to the nearest bar to get drunk.",1645588491.0,"['pessimistic', 'development', ',', 'try', 'find', 'best', 'case', 'optimism', 'challenge', 'think', '.',

43,sz5kig,Could Putin be betting on the financial elite's solidarity against taxes to avoid the only kind of sanctions that could hurt him and his peers?,Question,25,0.89,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sz5kig/could_putin_be_betting_on_the_financial_elites/,5,"putin together with his formal and informal government have prepared their country for the sanctions it is about to be struck with. russian economy is stable and moving away from the dollar, the currency reserves can withstand a siege and even financially russia seems to have some kind of plan against a switch ban.

the only effective sanction-based deterrence seems, to me at least, to be the seizure of russian property in europe and the us. however such goods would be owned through she will corporations and other schemes.

my point is: if nato countries decide to punish the wealthy russian elite, they will demonstrate the ability that they have to go after hidden money. if it works it could stir some trouble because why not do it for everybody then? these sanctions could also give the wealthy non-russian elite in eu (i do not know about the us) some trouble.

60,svdgqd,Asian countries began to show interest in the Northern Sea Route,Discussion,112,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/svdgqd/asian_countries_began_to_show_interest_in_the/,24," the creation of a new global transport corridor on the basis of the northern sea route is the main condition for the development of the russian arctic zone. compared to the suez canal, the northern sea route saves one thousand tons of fuel, which costs more than 600 thousand us dollars. moreover, time is saved. if the cargo is delivered through the suez canal within 6-7 weeks, the delivery time is 3-4 weeks across the northern sea route. in addition, unlike the southern sea routes (through the strait of malacca), there are no pirates along this route. this is also an important point for the safety of cargo transportation.  

many countries are already considering the northern sea route as the main alternative to the suez canal. china is currently the main stakeholder in the development of the northern sea route. this is logical, because the road to europe, for which china became a major partner in 2020, is shrinking significantly.

it should be noted that south korea showed interest in this area in 2021. this statement was made at the meeting of the russian-korean joint commission on economic and scientific and technical cooperation, at which both sides noted the partnership of the two countries in implementing the new nordic policy.

the arctic is indeed a key area of economic partnership between moscow and seoul. first of all, both countries are interested in shipbuilding projects. this is no coincidence, because korea is considered the world’s leader in this industry and produces the most advanced liquefied natural gas (lng) ships.

but seoul’s interests in the arctic go deeper. korean carriers were among the first foreign partners to realize the benefits of the north sea route. the strong korean economy is totally dependent on liquefied natural gas and oil, so the supply of hydrocarbons via an alternative route is the main issue of national importance.

in the long run, south korea could become a major asian distribution hub for russian hydrocarbons delivered through the north sea route. to this end, seoul plans to use the ports of ulsan and yosu. and such plans are feasible, because russia expects to increase the annual freight flow of the route to 150 million tons per year by 2030.

export of korean technology is another important aspect of cooperation. seoul is ready to participate on a large scale in the refurbishment of russian shipyards and ship repair plants, which is of particular value against the background of the current western sanctions. korea has interesting developments in the industrial production of methane hydrate in the arctic, so this issue is currently being discussed by seoul and moscow.",1645174842.0,"['creation', 'new', 'global', 'transport', 'corridor', 'basis', 'northern', 'sea', 'route', 'main', 'condition', 'development', 'russian', 'arctic',

# article: indonesia’s value-added mining policy paying dividends

by john mcbeth

jakarta – when the susilo bambang yudhoyono government pushed through indonesia’s 2009 mining law, industry skeptics warned that provisions in the legislation ending the export of raw minerals and ushering in a new era of value-added manufacturing would cost the country dearly.

now those same critics are having to eat their words. led by the booming nickel industry, iron and steel exports this year are expected to top us$20.5 billion, double that of 2020 and one reason why the economy has stayed afloat through the covid-19 pandemic.

that will make the category indonesia’s biggest foreign exchange earner, ahead of palm oil, oil and gas and electrical equipment, with the country relying on exports to take the place of still-sluggish domestic consumption as the main economic driver.

the world bank estimates the economy expanded by 3.7% this year and forecasts it will accelerate to 5.2% next year, the highest growth rate since 2013, provided indonesia avoids the danger of a new covid-19 spike and the government maintains its record of sound monetary and fiscal policies.

the world bank warns in its latest quarterly report that downside risks remain high amid uncertainty about the pandemic and global financial conditions, saying the government will need to pursue policies that strengthen investment, speed up human capital accumulation and boost productivity.

analysts see signs of a significant change in the mindset of government policymakers, led by president joko widodo, with what they feel are credible attempts to launch indonesia on the path towards long-term quality growth.

the ambitious job creation omnibus law is part of that, but the boldest reform move in decades has run into trouble with the constitutional court, concerned about how the correct procedures were not followed in rushing it through the house of representatives (dpr).

the legislation is crucial to widodo’s drive to remove bureaucratic obstacles to foreign investment, allowing the country to capitalize on its vast store of natural resources and take an important place in the global supply chain.

indonesia is now the world’s second-largest exporter of stainless steel, mostly produced by china’s tsingshan steel at its two nickel-processing complexes at morawali in central sulawesi and weda bay on the neighboring island of halmahera.

in a move to develop a full nickel supply chain, the company is in the process of building a $4 billion lithium-ion battery facility at morawali for the rapidly-expanding electric vehicle (ev) market.

south korean carmaker hyundai and lg energy solution have also broken ground on a $1.1 billion lithium battery facility near jakarta, and will start construction next year on a nickel smelter at central java’s batang industrial estate.

indonesia is the world’s largest nickel producer, mining 760,000 tonnes of ore in 2020 alone. although a ban on ore exports was imposed in 2014, five years after the passage of the new mining law, it was not fully enforced until early this year.

the ministry of energy and mineral resources says 19 smelters are now under construction, 13 of which will process either nickel, bauxite or copper. the demand for nickel to be used in electric vehicles is projected to rise by 23% over the next eight years.

only this week, work began on a green industrial park in north kalimantan, a long-term $132 billion venture which will use hydroelectric power to produce solar panels, semiconductors, lithium batteries and green aluminum products from bauxite mined in ore-rich west kalimantan.

tsingshan, australia’s fortescue metals group and the united arab emirates (uea) are expected to be three of the 30,000-hectare park’s main investors, adding a further milestone to widodo’s legacy as leader of an infrastructure and industrial revolution.

the length of toll roads built under his eight-year presidency runs to 1,962 kilometers, far exceeding the 795kms built over the previous 3.5 decades and elevating construction to 10.7% of gdp. a further 1,963 kilometers is planned for 2022-2024.

“indonesia’s economic transformation starts here where we will manage our natural resources from upstream to downstream to create massive job availability,” the president said at the opening ceremony of the kalimantan venture.

the president and his chief lieutenant, maritime affairs and investment minister luhut panjaitan, have warned that over the next decade, the european union and united states will refuse to buy products made with non-renewable energy.

some of the electricity from the $12 billion, 9,000-megawatt kayan river hydro station is slated to power the proposed new indonesian capital in east kalimantan, which widodo seems determined to press on with in the two and a half years he has left in office.

the state capital bill is expected to pass parliament in early 2022, laying out the legislative framework for moving the central government from jakarta to the new 256,000-hectare site, beginning with the relocation of six ministries in the first half of 2024.

meanwhile, improving current and fiscal accounts, low inflation and record foreign exchange reserves put indonesia in a solid position to maintain the rupiah’s stability ahead of a potential tightening by the us federal reserve.

boosted by a global bond sale, bank indonesia’s (bi) official reserves stood at a record $145.9 billion at the end of november, sufficient to fund 8.3 months of imports – or 8.1 months of imports and servicing jakarta’s external debt. 

that will allow bi to intervene in the spot foreign exchange market, domestic non-deliverable forward markets or purchase government bonds dumped by foreign investors as a way of controlling the movement of the rupiah.

the impact on the current account of record-high exports and a surplus trend dating back to last may underlines the trade-driven nature of the indonesian economy and the benefits of persistently high commodity prices

the digital economy has emerged as another new growth driver. in 2021, e-commerce contributed the largest gross merchandise value (gmv) of $53 billion, offsetting pandemic-induced contractions in transport and food.

but risks are looming. fed chairman jerome powell’s senate testimony signaling a speedier rate hike timeline has put indonesia and other emerging markets on edge and could lead to investors seeking safer havens in the coming months.

premature tapering could also threaten indonesia’s trade surplus by forcing traders to pull back, sparking corrections in the commodity market. on top of that are fears that the omicron variant could slow down economic recovery, especially if it leads to new mobility restrictions. 

analysts say a stable rupiah is a precondition for the market to perform well. while near-term volatility cannot be ruled out, the medium to long-term outlook looks promising.

they note that capital account risk is cushioned by the previous exodus of equity outflows and limited covid-19 stimulus in-flows so far. additionally, some forecasts are predicting a narrowing of the fiscal deficit to as low as 4.6% of gdp in 2022. 

finance ministry data shows this year’s deficit is likely to top out at about 873.6 trillion rupiah ($61.34 billion), or between 5.18 and 5.54%, substantially lower than the budgeted 5.7% as it seeks to restore a legally-mandated 3% cap by 2023.

although busy shopping malls and traffic congestion in jakarta reflect an economy returning to normality, bi’s retail sales index – based on 700 retailers in 10 cities – shows consumption levels are still down on 2019 levels.

but bucking a global trend, indonesia’s food prices have remained relatively stable, helping to protect the purchasing power of workers who have either lost their jobs or seen their wages shrink over the past two years.

as effective as they have been, the government’s social assistance programs have been unable to prevent an increase in the number of indonesians below the poverty line from a record 9.2% in late 2019 to the current 10.4%.

energy surpluses have also helped to offset higher prices in other parts of the world, where inflation is a growing problem. capped at $70 a ton, the domestic market obligation (dmo) mechanism for coal plays a major role in ensuring that indonesia’s electricity prices remain stable.

politically-powerful coal producers have still been able to register record profits because the dmo only applies to 25% of sales. that suggests the arrangement may continue to be sustainable, even if the future of coal looks increasingly grim as indonesia is forced to look for cleaner energy.

67,stjum7,Have overseas missions been beneficial or detrimental to the armed forces of smaller/medium sized nations?,Question,149,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/stjum7/have_overseas_missions_been_beneficial_or/,33,"for example, look at say poland or netherlands. neither are going to ever fight a war alone. overseas missions provide combat experience for their troops as well as working in a multinational setup but at the same time it provides wear and tear on their equipment. not to mention, if they ever fought a large scale war, it would be worlds different than light infantry-focused peacekeeping missions of the last 30 years. i am aware so many nations have had large budget cuts over the last few decades. 

would the estonians or norwegians or czechs or whomever have had to deal with the same hit to their defense budgets were it not for their focus on missions to iraq and afghanistan and mali? or has the missions in those warzones helped boost defense spending and bring focus to their armed focus in a way that a peacetime period would not have?

82,sowqax,Wondering if such a thing exists as a supply chain dependency visualizer,Question,93,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sowqax/wondering_if_such_a_thing_exists_as_a_supply/,48,"i have been musing on a thought lately: ""everything working depends on everything working"". but considering this, it seems that it is not quite true. some systems are more resilient and either have more redundant, swap-able inputs, or rely on more robust inputs. and some things are more delicate and require greater webs of systems to function. 

i am imagining a chart, or a map, or some kind of representation of the interdependencies where you can visualize the degree of dependency of one system on another.

for example you could select semiconductors, and it would highlight the industries that rely on them and the relative degree to which they rely on them. or you could toggle a switch and see the things that the semiconductor industry relies on and so forth. 

or take a car. the metal can be sourced from mines all over the world. the transmissions can be made in a handful of factories. the semiconductors all come from tsmc. so you could give this car a resiliency rating, based on the resilience of its dependencies. 


of course this quickly gets extremely complicated due to the recursive dependencies. but i wonder if there is not some limit that you can approach where modeling this gives you a basic rough idea of the general anatomy of the global supply chain and its main limbs and interconnections. this is the sort of thing i would picture some cia analyst manipulating on a clear glass screen deep in some fusion hub in a tom cruise movie. i would think there has to be some version of this somewhere..

or maybe the software is just the minds of those capable of imagining and comprehending all of these relationships?",1644464957.0,"['muse', 'thought', 'lately', ':', '``', 'everything', 'work',

85,soisau,Turkish Influence in Central Asia,Analysis,130,0.95,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/soisau/turkish_influence_in_central_asia/,13,"turkey spent much of the 20th century building itself back up after the collapse of the ottoman empire, striving to become the major power at the world's crossroads once again. turkey's influence now extends wider than it has in decades, from the battlefields of north africa to the slopes of the caucasus, to the supply chains of europe, and into the frontlines of syria. in the country's pursuit of regional power however, there remains one more front they are still yet to gain deep influence in: central asia. 4 of the 5 former soviet central asian republics have a turkic background, and are striving to diversify their trading partnerships, but does turkey actually stand a chance of being able to pull any of these republics away from the gravitational pull of russia and china?

many would argue that turkey and its politicians desire to live up to a historical regional legacy, and this can be seen through the country’s efforts to gain influence in a number of its neighbouring regions. most obvious is its involvement in the middle east, where it has played a role in the syrian conflict in particular over the last decade, cementing its role as a regional power who must be at the table for future decisions. this model of intervention has played out somewhat successfully for ankara in both nagorno-karabakh, libya, somalia and in syria, and is looking like a possible model to be refined in their other neighbouring regions, including north africa, south-eastern europe, the caucuses, and central asia.

to quickly look at north africa for context, turkey has been a large presence in the libyan civil war, with its drones and mercenaries being instrumental in a number of key battles throughout the country, even on occasion going head-to-head with russia’s own proxies and drones. in southeast europe, their primary focus has recently been on ukraine, with ankara being very outspoken against moscow’s annexation of crimea, and rapidly expanding the scope of its relationship with kyiv. this has included limited defence cooperation, where the two are working together on naval construction and some aspects of operations, as well as aviation engineering, and critically, turkey’s drone program. in the caucuses again turkey’s drones were immensely powerful in the nagorno-karabakh conflict between azerbaijan and armenia, and the relationship between ankara and baku is extremely strong.

so where does turkey’s interest in central asia come from, and what role is it trying to carve out for itself in a region dominated by russia culturally, and china economically? a number of the experts we interviewed for the piece seem to pinpoint its origins at turkeys snubbing by the eu, and their failure to meaningfully advance toward eu membership or closer ties with the european union in the early 2000’s, with this snubbing becoming the major catalyst for the countries decision to pivot away from europe and toward the middle east and africa. with the roads into europe becoming increasingly stonewalled by the eu, erdogan seems to be throwing his weight behind the countries “*look east* “ doctrine. this change in national doctrine precipitated turkey’s increased roles to its south and east, and brings us to where we are today.

ankara is hoping to use its turkic cultural connections as a conversation starter to begin relationships with a number of these central asian republics, and possibly act as the republics gateways into europe for the sale of their vast energy resources. for this reason, matthew bryza argues that there is nostalgia and cultural influence in its decision to try and establish itself in central asia, but underneath that is increasingly economically unstable anakra desperate for additional revenue streams.

it should be said though that when travelling through this region of the world it is still incredibly evident that moscow's roots are still embedded deep into the ground, and russian is still the lingua franca of the region. poll after poll in the majority of the central asian populations shows a preference toward moscow over beijing, even though china regularly outspends russia in parts of the region. ankara is hoping this penchant for cultural affinity over economic stability could work in turkey’s favour and act as a future blueprint for improving its ties with the regions inhabitants.

although still below a majority, russia and china have seen a slightly growing populist opposition to them in the central asian states in recent years, and bruce pannier argues that turkey could sidestep this opposition because of the historical and cultural connections that it has in the region. as such, turkey aims to either create a role just for itself, or work with russia and/or china on projects to be the more acceptable face of various efforts to increase influence in the region. ankara is well aware of its minor economic weight compared to moscow and china, but there is hope in the turkish foreign policy circles that the country could gain enough influence to become the balance of power in the region, encouraging bejiing and moscow to cooperate with ankara to maintain stability in central asia.

despite this, russia’s influence should not be underestimated, and while turkey’s military export business is strong, russia is a step above and will remain critical for regional security, especially following the taliban’s takeover of afghanistan. turkey though is trying to make inroads in the regions arms industry, and just in recent months we have been seeing a step up in turkeys sales of drones to krygyzstan, and the deploying of military advisors into the country. last april we saw conflict break out in the border areas between kyrgyzstan and tajikistan, leaving around 50 dead. the same area along the border is now heating up again, with kyrgyz nationalists renaming ethnicly tajik towns to krygyz names in a direct provocation of the tajik population. some analysts in the region worry that turkey may look to support bishkek in a similar way it assisted azerbaijan in the karabakh conflict, something almost everyone agrees was largely responsible for the azeri victory in the war. turkish influence here in central asia though risks the conflict widening and drawing other regional players like iran, china and russia in, so ankara is being warned to proceed with caution in its dealings with kyrgyzstan. because of this, turkey’s growing roles in its many neighbouring regions will be important to keep an eye on going forward, as they have the potential to be very influential military, politically, and even economically.turkey still has a long way to go before it can ever hope to legitimately muscle out russian or chinese influence in these countries, but i also think they are an entity in the region that should be watched carefully. if there is a conflict on the tajik border, and turkey does play a major role, or turkey builds the pipeline infrastructure to connect the turkmen gas fields to the european markets across the caspian, or they simply provide major funding for turkic nationalist candidates in some elections, ankara may actually be on its way to the long shot of becoming the balance of power between russia and china in the region.i would love to get this subs thoughts on the subject though.

will turkey move to militarily back krygyzstan in the event of another war with tajikistan?will ankara have the finances to build meaningful infrastructure in the area, or are they already vastly overstretched? and with turkey now prosecuting turkmen activists protesting in istanbul, will be see backlash against ankara from the general populations of these countries?if you are interested in checking out the full piece on *“turkish influence in central asia”* we put together a fortnight ago withalex kokcharov >> principal research analyst at ihs markit, and a specialising in ukraine, russia, and the former soviet states

111,sezt9d,Putin's Gamble: Why a cold front in Europe could determine the fate of Ukraine and international norms,Analysis,20,1.0,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sezt9d/putins_gamble_why_a_cold_front_in_europe_could/,4,"*as the mounting tensions in ukraine become increasingly hot, it might be a cold spell that could determine the fate of not just the ukrainian government, but also the future of international norms.*

**abstract.** russia’s president putin lies at the center of the potential conflict, and the decision to initiate a conflict would likely be his to make. the calculus of the decision, while multi-variable, is conversely somewhat simple. on the one hand, putin has the opportunity to remove a belligerent state whose shift towards integration within the eu provides an existential threat to putin’s regime. this opportunity must be weighed against the cost of the west’s response and the risk of a western intervention. because while the 2009 reforms sharpened the edge of russia’s military, the vast bulk is still comprised of soviet era technology; technology certainly capable of providing weight to a conflict with a similarly equipped ukrainian force but unlikely to match against a near-peer force like nato.^[1](-main-developments-in-russian-military-capability/)[2](-balance/2020/10/russia-armed-forces)

**background.** to avoid an intervention, putin must do what putin does best: maskirovska, the ability to make something that is look like something that is not. putin’s regime began with the 1999 apartment bombings, a terrorist attack of questionable origins[3](-russia-president-1999-chechnya-apartment-bombings/30097551.html)[4](-vladimir-putin-1999-russian-apartment-house-bombings-was-putin-responsible) that provided a pretext for the second chechen war. the successful handling of this war as prime minister solidified putin as the strong leadership russia lacked throughout the 1990s and vaulted him to the presidency.[5](-bombings-mikhail-trepashkin-and-putin/amp)

nine years later, georgia and russia go to war over the breakaway states of abkhazia and south ossetia. while the root causes of the war are difficult to parse[6](-august-war-ten-years-on-a-retrospective-on-the-russo-georgian-war/); the end result of the war is not.[7]() russia, exceedingly well prepared for the conflict, overwhelmed georgia’s military in less than two weeks, russian peacekeepers remain stationed in the breakaway states largely run as de facto russian territory, and georgian aspirations for nato integration appear on life support. occurring during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis and two months before the us presidential election, western responses were limited.[8](-2008-russo-georgian-war-putins-green-light)

euromaidan in late 2013 saw ukraine coalesce as a nation pivoting towards the eu and nato.[9](-post/the-significance-euromaidan-for-ukraine-and-europe) three months later, the infamous little green men appear in crimea[10](-europe-26532154). the stateless nature of the forces and ongoing pro-russian protests provided sufficient cover for putin to claim crimean self-determination of its status.[11]() [12](-015-0043-9.pdf) subsequently similar if slightly less successful operations in donetsk and luhansk devolved into the ongoing war in the donbas. again, putin provided just enough confusion to paralyze a western response and destabilize a neighbor’s entry into nato.[13](-berlin.org/publications/products/research_papers/2019rp05_fhs.pdf)

**today.** clearly, no one should underestimate putin’s ability to fabricate a casus belli or to foster discord in the west and paralyze any response. the operational deployment of russian forces provides putin the capability to take advantage of any opportunity that may present itself. the short term objective for putin of regime change in kiev could be accomplished with a short, decisive offensive in concert with civil unrest fostered from moscow.[14](-possible-invasion-ukraine) although the ukraine of today has a mostly modern road system, putin still likely respects the impact rasputitsa can have on offensive operations. thus, any conflict will likely occur before the spring melt. this coincides with european usage of russian gas, the greatest leverage putin has to directly impact a potential western response.[15](-11-10/how-europe-has-become-so-dependent-on-putin-for-gas-quicktake) [16]()

ultimately, putin’s decision hinges on his risk tolerance and what response he believes the west, largely led by the you.s. and specifically president biden, can mount. if putin can present the conflict as a russian response to some incident at the border or within ukraine itself, he can potentially freeze the western response. if timed with a particularly brutal cold snap when europe and particularly germany are burning russian gas to stay warm, it could allow just enough time for “ukrainian self-determination” to be influenced back in moscow's direction.

to putin, the west could take whatever pretense for the conflict at face value as they did in georgia in 2008 and accept the fait accompli in ukraine as they did in crimea in 2014. putin’s regime removes a potential threat in kiev but perhaps more importantly, demonstrates that the international order championed by the west and illustrated by nato is not so much incapable as unwilling to stand by the concept that force is no longer an acceptable tool of policy. that the world will not protect smaller nations from the wolves in the night and instead strength, and particularly the willingness to use it, will be the international norm of the 21st century.

this is putin’s gamble. far from reckless, putin has demonstrated a cunning willingness to take advantage of whatever opportunity presents itself to reestablish russia as a major geopolitical player and destabilize potential threats on the federation’s borders. these actions demonstrate the strength of russia (and by extension, putin’s government) to both a domestic and international audience and provide sufficient legitimacy to continue plundering the nations wealth for his own (and other oligarch's) personal gain.

**future.** so what should be the west’s response? the first answer is exactly what it is doing. preemptive unmasking of the disinformation that putin used to cover his actions. a concerted and coordinated response to any military action becomes more certain the less maskirovska he is able to put in place.

the second, and most likely course of action, are sanctions. while certainly providing an impact on the russian economy (and thus putin’s personal wealth), sanctions could be viewed by putin as a cost of doing business. moreover, continued use of sanctions only push the russian economy further away from the west. thus, while a factor, sanctions are unlikely to ultimately play a key role in putin’s decision and may be counterproductive for the west in the long term.

the third response, and the most unlikely, would be a soft military intervention of peacekeepers at the onset of hostilities. a resolution through the un for a peacekeeping force would likely be welcomed by ukraine and could allow time to defuse any casus belli. while a textbook application of the overall mission of the un, russia (and possibly china’s) position on the security council almost guarantee a veto. even still, quick presentation of a proposal (and resulting veto) would force russia to crystallize their position to the international community that peace in ukraine would be on russian terms only.

finally, and of most concern to putin, would be a coordinated and concerted international military response. putin may gamble that the west’s (both domestic us and intra-alliance) discord will give him time. he may gamble reliance on russian gas or lack of a formal security guarantee with ukraine will prompt germans and other europeans to collectively shrug. most importantly, he may gamble biden cannot provide the leadership to assemble a coalition of international consensus against his actions. he could argue (not without merit), that us actions in iraq and afghanistan constituted similar regime changes.

thus, ukraine provides a litmus test for the current international system. biden’s greatest challenge will be convincing the world that previous american policy mistakes should not engender future russian ones. if the world no longer treats armed conflict as a means of settling territorial disputes, frozen conflicts in taiwan, siachen, ethiopia, or the balkans may no longer be restrained. if putin gets a cold snap in ukraine, the ensuing conflict could drag everyone into a world full of wolves.",1643401432.0,"['*', 'mount', 'tension', 'ukraine', 'become', 'increasingly', 'hot', ',',

i am even more puzzled following trump's emphasis on the wall and, before that, the eu's refugee crises.  

i move on to bafflement given what a vested interest any military has in diverse, resilient, and sustainable supply lines, a pacified populace that sustain a long slog, and how much potential cross over there is in a lot of green tech and military applications (portable solar,  distribute and automated food production/water desalination, batteries, etc.)

skyrocketing temperatures, flooding, loss of arable land, water, etc. and accompanying chaos are likely inevitable and yet it seems to me that very few nations are pre-building capacities to either ward off popular uprisings, prepare for their neighbors collapse and flood of refugees, seize territory en mass? 

what about the ability to potentially weaponize climate change or, conversely, prepare to try and alter the temperature while sustaining global pushback?  

there is quite a bit that is possible, especially for ambitious autocrats, to prepare for that would allow them to exploit the chaos.  

and yes, aside from russia taking a pretty good look at the north pole, i cannot think of anyone pushing this?  

so, why are not the militaries pushing this?

many of you already know me as the map guy from political geography now ([www.polgeonow.com]()), my website aimed at providing ideologically-neutral news and educational features about statehood, borders, and territorial control around the world.

i am happy to announce that the mods have invited me to do another ama here, and i will be answering questions from january 31, 2022 until at least february 6. in the meantime, please feel free to submit any questions you have in advance! some of my favorite topics are map design, the world's current system of countries and borders, and the many cracks and spaces between them. i do not claim much expertise on military strategy, policy analysis, or predicting the future, but no topic is strictly off-limits.

some of the most recent free map articles i have put together for the site have been about [territorial control in somalia](-controls-somalia-crisis-timeline.html), [queen elizabeth losing one of her 16 independent countries](-ends-constitutional-monarchy.html), and [somalia and kenya’s sea boundary dispute](-somalia-maritime-dispute-maps.html). a map of rebel control in ethiopia’s civil war is ~~coming up soon too~~ [now online](-war-map-november-2021-2022.html)!

polgeonow makes money mostly from paid subscribers to our territorial control map series, but a lot of the content is free too. by the time i come back here to answer questions, the patreon for our free content may also have launched, so if you are a potential supporter, also feel free to use this space to grill me on any doubts you might have! 😉

in previous years i have done amas at r/geopolitics [here](/) and [here](/), and one at r/geography [here](/).

looking forward to chatting with everyone soon - ask me anything!

edit 2022-01-31: here i am! it is already nighttime here in taiwan, but i am going to start on some of the answers tonight before i go to bed. i will get to all of them eventually, either tomorrow or later in the week!

131,s4r4fu,Will Libya normalize relations with Israel?,Question,218,0.95,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/s4r4fu/will_libya_normalize_relations_with_israel/,12,"three days ago it was [reported](-news/article-692331) that ""mossad director david barnea and libyan prime minister abdulhamid mohammed al-dabaiba recently met in jordan to discuss normalization and security cooperation."" dabaiba heads the government of national accord (backed by turkey). he denies the meeting took place.

it is now being [reported](-haftar-plane-lands-israel-two-hour-visit) that ""a plane belonging to libyan commander khalifa haftar landed briefly in tel aviv on thursday, according to an israeli news report."" we do not know for certain who was on board, but haftar has reportedly met with members of israeli intelligence in the past. haftar was set to run in the presidential election this past december before it was postponed. he is backed by russia, egypt, and the united arab emirates and heads the self-styled libyan national army in eastern libya. 

>according to haaretz, haftar has promised that he would launch a recognition process akin to that carried out by the uae, bahrain, and morocco last year, in exchange for ""military and diplomatic assistance"" from israel.

in addition, ""in november last year, haftar's son saddam landed in israel on a private jet amid reports about the possibility of the commander promising an agreement to recognise israel after the presidential election.""

152,ruegag,Russia's Pacific Strategy,Analysis,441,0.97,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ruegag/russias_pacific_strategy/,142,"with the eyes of the world fixated on russia’s border with ukraine, moscow is beginning to make major moves 7500km to the east on the russian pacific coast. most major powers have already begun their pivot to asia, and now russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. will russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant china in this theatre? 

with its heartland west of the ural mountains, russia has long been tightly europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the indo-pacific, moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. these regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the soviet era, and aside from hosting russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in moscow since much of nuclear forces were redeployed to kola.   
at present vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. the russian *vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving russia could rapidly deploy forces to the pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of kremlin planners. the exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. the russian forces have been a predominately western focused force, and that stokes fears that the russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the pacific front continues to gain importance.   

to try and combat this putin set in motion his own pivot to asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the russian far-east. little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

this issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in russian surface fleets. with 5 fleets to modernise, russia’s pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its baltic, northern, and even black sea fleets meaning that vladivostok continues to receive the russian navies leftovers.  although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

so where have incremental economic improvements to the russian pacific theatre come from? well, largely from china. russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging russia’s hegemony in the region. 

with an ascendant china in the region though is russia being delegated to a junior partner? we certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between russian forces and the pla and plan, and in those operations russia has largely taken a backseat to china in regional issues, such as korea. the caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still have not seen what would happen if china and russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. the closeness of the russia-china relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. for the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

the question i would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for moscow to place the pacific front on the same priority level as the northern or black sea fronts, and how would moscow react to a conflict in the south china sea?   
my gut feeling is that russia would assist china with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in europe? i am keen to get this subs thoughts though. 

if you are interested to go further though we actually did a whole analysis piece with the below panel on this exact subject this week.  
joining us for it were:  
neil melvin >>     director of international and security studies at the royal united services institute, specialising in the emerging security dynamics in russia and the middle east.

natasha kuhrt >> part of the department of war studies at king's college london, and a specialist in russia and its outlying regions, including central asia and the far east.

jeffrey edmonds >> expert on russia and asia for can, formerly the director for russia on the us national security council and former acting senior director for russia in the obama administration. also a former military analyst for the cia covering eurasian militaries.

153,rugesv,Geopolitical balance between professional and conscript armies?,Question,79,0.98,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rugesv/geopolitical_balance_between_professional_and/,4,"in the distant past for the most part regular soldiers or mercenaries expected to be compensated for their services, either through regular pay, bounties and of course looting of occupied areas if permitted. this placed a significant financial strain on all but the most powerful states, when a large amount of troops had to be raised and sustained during great confrontations like the punic wars, arab–byzantine wars, ottoman–habsburg wars or seven years' war. the levée en masse implemented in the napoleonic wars is a general draft that came to be used even in peace time by almost every industrialized nation until the late 20th century, it allowed rapid replacement of losses as well as the fielding of much larger armies that directly led to the shockingly high casualty rates of the world wars. the united states was one of the first countries to suspend conscription in 1973, mostly because of political pressure rather than some strategic imperative to reduce overall strength by over a third at nearly the same point that soviet conventional forces were actually expanding. today china and india actually have a glut of citizens willing to serve, but maintaining force levels is proving to be quite a challenge for other fully professional militaries, an issue that constant improvement in compensation and benefits appears unable to address. the de facto mixed system currently employed by many military powers such as russia, turkey, iran, thailand, brazil, ukraine and israel sets the required number of troops every year, then the shortfall in volunteers is offset with well-trained though modestly paid conscripts, the idea being that this keeps personnel costs down and frees up a higher percentage of the defense budget for procuring equipment and maintaining infrastructure.",1641149614.0,"['distant', 'past', 'part',

155,ru6sy9,An imminent flashpoint in the Indo-Pacific: Senkaku/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai Islands,Analysis,90,0.92,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/ru6sy9/an_imminent_flashpoint_in_the_indopacific/,18,"the 50-year-old controversy between japan, the people's republic of china (prc) and taiwan over the sovereignty of a group of tiny, uninhabited islets and rocks in the east china sea, administered by japan and referred to as the senkaku islands in japan, as the diaoyu islands in the prc and as the diaoyutai islands in taiwan has become a proxy battlefield in the growing sino-us great power competition in the indo-pacific, against the backdrop of a widening sino-japanese power gap.

**the geographical location of the disputed island**

the contested islets and rocks are located at about 170 km northwest of japan's ishigaki island/okinawa prefecture, at approximately 170 km northeast of taiwan, and roughly 330 km off the coast of mainland china. they have a total area of 6.3 km^(2) and consist of five volcanic islets and three barren rocky outcrops. their geological characteristics are distinct from those located in the south china sea. the biggest islet, uotsuri island, is the only 'island', sustaining a japanese population engaged in economic activity until the 1930s.

**republic of china's claim over diaoyutai**

according to the roc, china discovered the diaoyutai islands in 1372 during the ming dynasty (1368–1644), and since then, the chinese people have been closely linked to them. the areas surrounding the islands had been repeatedly referred to as part of chinese history since 1534. chinese envoys at the time used the islands as a navigation post en route to the ryūkyū kingdom (now okinawa). furthermore, according to roc foreign minister david lin, “the most authoritative historical records supporting the chinese claim are envoy mission records and official taiwan gazetteers published during the qing dynasty (1644–1912).”

due to its diplomatic isolation, taipei's voice is often ignored, even though it is a claimant state in both the east and south china seas. however, roc claims that the islands form an inherent territory of taiwan based on the islands geographical location, geological structure, historical evidence, usage, and international law.however, in recent years, taipei was able to score some gains by using a two-pronged strategy.

on the “soft” side, president ma ying-jeou in august 2012 proposed an east china sea peace initiative (ecspi) calling on all parties to,

* restrain from taking any antagonistic actions,
* shelve controversies and not abandon dialogue, (3) observe international law and resolve disputes through peaceful means,
* seek consensus on a code of conduct in the east china sea, and
* establish a mechanism for cooperation on exploring and developing resources in the east china sea

implementation guidelines soon followed, calling for a two-stage implementation:

* peaceful dialogue and mutually reciprocal negotiation and
* sharing resources and cooperative development. 

on the ""hard"" side, soon after japan’s nationalization announcement, taipei blessed some activists seeking to land on those disputed islands and at one point even dispatched its coast guard ships to shoot water cannons at japanese patrol ships. taiwan’s assertive behaviour caught many observers by surprise and raised the spectre of a tacit collaboration between taiwan and china, despite the roc’s repeated denial.

perhaps to head off possible china-taiwan collusion and with us nudging, japan signed a fishery agreement with taiwan in april 2013— the first concession over the island quarrel after seventeen futile previous rounds of negotiation. taiwanese boats can now operate freely in a 7,400-square-kilometer area around these islands.

**conflicting sovereignty claims to the disputed islands**

while prc/roc share the narrative which is built on historic evidence substantiating its claim of having first discovered the islands in 1372 under the ming dynasty (1368-1644) and of the islands have been an 'inherent part of chinese territory since ancient times.

the narrative defended by japan, which currently has administrative control over the islands, is based on the acquisition of ownership through discovery and occupation. japan has consistently denied that there is a sovereignty dispute in the first place. according to japan's official position, tatsushiro koga, a japanese businessman, explored the islands in 1884 and leased four of them from 1896 after japan had carried out on-site field surveys, in line with procedures set out in international law.

japan incorporated the island into okinawa prefecture in 1895, during the sino-japanese war a few months prior to the treaty of shimonoseki by china and japan in april 1985. under this treaty, china ceded to japan 'the island of formosa (taiwan), together with all islands appertaining or belonging to the said island of formosa, as well as the penghu islands. the eight islets and rocks are not mentioned. the prc, however, asserts that they were among the territory ceded to japan, while japan claims that they were already japanese territory.

the prc and taiwan have argued that the islands should have been returned to china under the 1943 cairo declaration and the 1945 potsdam declaration, following japan's unconditional surrender after world war ii. under the potsdam declaration 'japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of honshu, hokkaido, kyushu, shikoku and such minor islands as we determine'. the japanese position, however, states that article 3 of the 1951 san francisco treaty of peace with japan provides 'that the nansei shoto islands be placed under the administrative authority of the us'. it also states that at that time, the senkaku islands were included in the nansei shoto islands and thus remained as part of japanese territory.

**gradual militarisation of the sovereignty dispute**

prior to 2010, the senkaku/diaoyu islands were a relatively peripheral issue in sino-japanese relations.

* **september 7, 2010**a chinese fishing trawler collided with japanese coast guard ships in the waters surrounding the islands, resulting in the japanese detention of the ship and crew and the arrest of the captain. this spiralled into a major diplomatic incident, as beijing applied increasing pressure on japan for their return. japan first released the ship and crew, and then eventually also the captain, after which tensions subsided.
* **2012, nationalization of the disputed island**the japanese government chose to preempt an initiative by the nationalist mayor of tokyo to buy several of the islands from a private owner by purchasing the islands themselves. this unleashed a new round of conflict involving popular protests and official tensions. the 2010 collision and subsequent 2012 purchase were thus decisive turning points in the nature of the sino-japanese dispute over the senkaku/diaoyu islands. 

since late 2010 the islands have increased in significance as a symbol, as a domestic political football, and as an object of ongoing, competitive jockeying. the islands became increasingly salient as a domestic political issue in no small part because of their growing symbolic significance. but at the same time, the symbolic import of the islands benefitted immensely from being championed by domestic politicians, activists, and others who latched onto the issue, whether opportunistically or out of sincere conviction. as the islands’ symbolic and domestic political importance rose, so too did the respective pressures on the leaders managing the contest to take stronger action. this set in motion competitive spirals of move and counter-move between tokyo and beijing.

**the prc's strategy of eroding japan's administrative control**

japan's 2020 defence white paper states that the prc has 'relentlessly continued attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in the sea area around the senkaku islands. since japan's acquisition of three of the disputed islands from a private japanese landowner in september 2012, the prc has adopted a more offensive strategy, involving the deployment of 'grey-zone operations' aimed at gradually and incrementally challenging japan's administrative control over the contested islands and generating 'proof' of the prc's administrative control by means of sub-threshold coercion, without triggering an armed conflict. these operations are mainly performed by the china cost guard (ccg) and the maritime militia, with the plan remaining in the background to make operations look like pure civil law enforcement activities.

in september 2012 the ccg abruptly changed its operational pattern by significantly stepping up the number of its vessels present not only in the contiguous zone of 24 nm but also in the territorial sea of 12 nm around the contested islands. the increased presence of ccg vessels since 2012 did not come as a short flare-up as was the case in the wake of the 2010 trawler incident. rather the increasingly frequent and longer presence of the ccg in the maritime zones around the disputed islands has become a constant feature of what researchers have referred to as the first phase in a three-phased strategy of coercive grey-zone operations. the second phase of the strategy, i.e. overlapping administrative control, would be the prc's exercise of law enforcement rights in these maritime zones in parallel to japan.

**us position**

since 1972, the us has held a neutral position on the sovereignty of the disputed islands. however, in the 1990s the us started to confirm that they are covered by article 5 of the us-japanese treaty of mutual cooperation and security as japanese-administered territory. in 2014, former president barack obama made an oral us defence commitment in favour of the disputed islands in the event of their attack. in 2017, former president donald trump reaffirmed this us commitment in ajoint written declaration with then japanese prime minister shinzo abe. following this, the us air force and the japan air self-defence force (jasdf) held joint training flights near the disputed islands.

156,rtwu6b,Is defending Taiwan the best option for the USA?,Discussion,378,0.77,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rtwu6b/is_defending_taiwan_the_best_option_for_the_usa/,566,"the western strategic media seems obsessed with defending taiwan and keeping russia out of ukraine. but what if these are not the best options? ignoring ukraine for the moment, what if it is better to let china have taiwan and then fight on terms better suited to the usa and its allies?

to defend taiwan would mean putting a lot of us assets into danger - major fleet units would need to sail within range of shore-based aircraft and terminally-guided irbms, usmc ships would be even more vulnerable and any fight would be in contested airspace. china's huge ssk fleet is designed to fight in the straits as are its short-range assets.

would it not be better to trade 'space for time' as nato planned to do in a war against the wp? this would enable the usa to utilise its force multipliers without keeping one eye on the clock. the chinese invasion fleet is a one-shot weapon. it will suffer massive attrition from roc defences alone, without outside assistance, and the people of taiwan will not meekly submit to the ccp. the pla can look forward to constant attrition and civil disobedience.

in the meantime, the us and allies can just pick off the chinese multipliers one at a time until the pla is a shadow of its former self and most of the straits are covered in shipwrecks and splashed aircraft. until national infrastructure (much less robust than that in the west) is collapsing and sanctions, combined with destruction/surrender of chinese o/s assets (gwadar, trincomalee) are driving china towards starvation and economic collapse with no fuel for their military, no food or power for their people and an increasingly disruptive populace.

surely this is better than fighting the enemy on a battlefield of his choosing at a time of his choosing?

edit 1. thanks for the awards. i think this post has done its job of stimulating discussion of the matter.

edit 2. there seem to be a lot of commenters mistakenly thinking that i am advocating the abandonment of japan, roc and rok. this is not the case. these nations may suffer short-term pain from a lack

before someone points it out, of course the proposal is nothing like nato, but it would not be far-fetched to think that with time it could turn into something of a formal alliance.

considering this, what do you think would be the implications of said council coming to fruition and being a success? how would this affect, respectively, chinese and western plans for latin america? how would each great power react?

in my opinion, the biggest actor harmed by this would be the us, considering any type of military arrangement between latin american nations necessarily has the goal of counterbalancing the overwhelming north american hegemony in the americas.

170,rm8h37,Will US go to war with China over Taiwan?,,460,0.88,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rm8h37/will_us_go_to_war_with_china_over_taiwan/,339,"long time lurker of this sub. so there is been a lot of talk of war with china over taiwan, most of it focusing on how to fight the war and how likely will taiwan + us win. what i have not seen a lot of is whether us will actually go to war with china. 

from what i can see: 

1. taiwan is not in us backyard, there is not much in us's core strategic interest to fight china over taiwan. (freedom of navigation in scs is important but not core interest)

2. it is not going to be an easy fight, nuclear or not. conventionally, the logistics to move enough materiel to fight in west pacific is very expensive. and with chinese a2/ad capabilities, it is not going to be a walkover like desert storm. 

3. will us citizens support an expensive (in both treasure and american lives terms) war with china? the last time japan tried to be a hegemon in west pacific, there was serious consideration under war plan orange to not get embroiled in war, had japan not bombed pearl harbour. i mean, it is easy to talk and say yeah kill the chinese and sit on their skulls, but is the average american citizen okay with sending their loved ones to fight china over taiwan?

**edit: wow. this is actually my first time posting on reddit. i am amazed by the range and quality of responses and have tried to read through all of them. a few key points i keep seeing pop up, so i thought i will do a bit of clarification here.

a. let us assume the timeline is not tight. of course right now its impossible for war, if only because military buildup takes time (for all parties involved). but i guess what i am asking is more general. say, over the next 20 years, given current trends, what are the likelihoods of war with china?

b. for those who say the chinese military is a paper tiger, i think its hardly grounded in reality? i mean, sec def recently labelled china as a ""pacing challenge"". a kind of benchmark you measure your own military progress on. and even if right now plan is no match for the 11 cvbg the us has, they are building up capability at an incredible rate. a new ship being commissioned every month + a carrier that is at least on par with kitty hawk (maybe even nimitz without the nuclear propulsion) with some emals thrown in is scheduled to be commissioned early 2022. china only commissioned her first carrier in 2012, and she is not that far behind us already, tech wise. and that is not including the rapidly expanding hypersonic anti-ship missile arsenal to keep the usn at maximum range. all this to say, us will be fighting a near-peer competitor, and i wonder what is the appetite for such a fight? because sure as hell, it will be a war of attrition.

c. playing the devil's advocate here, those who mention that the us is unlikely to go to war and instead just sanction china, how effective will those sanctions be? china is not like iran, and economic sanctions affect it wayyyyy less. in fact, if we look at the trends for the last 30 years, china's dependence on fdi has dropped from 6% in the 1990s to right now 1% of gdp. -direct-investment. export as % of gdp has also dropped significantly from 30% to now hovering around 15%. of this 15%, us comprises roughly 17.5% of chinese exports) 
and also, that is what the belt and road is for. it is a precursor to a new global institution based on chinese rules, using a digital yuan that is free from us influence, so that china can break out of us encirclement in the economic sphere. 

d. eu is largely nato, but has different policy concerns as us, and will not always follow us in policy. (i mean, just look at france breaking away from aukus olympic boycott) we tend to think of eu being us's wingman, but when it comes down to it, if said policy does not align with eu's interest, they will walk away. yes, it is in eu interest to maintain fon in scs because according to unctad, at least 30% of world trade flows through there. however, the only reason why eu has trade flowing through there is because it is primarily trading with china (rest of sea account for very little trade by % of eu). eu is already bristling with russia, and to be able to exert maximum pressure, it cannot afford to also open another economic rift with china. getting eu buy-in to a broader war with china over taiwan seems really difficult. and then there is s.korea. s.korea has been taking a very conciliatory approach towards china, once again for economic reasons, and that china is so near to it. afaik, the military alliance between s.korea/japan and us is of a defensive nature, i.e. they are not obligated to declare war if they are not personally invaded. japan is facing a population crunch already (decades ahead of china), and its just really bad policy to send your remaining young people to war. 

e. getting taiwan = getting dominance over westpac. this part i have some difficulty following. some comments mention that if china manages to take taiwan, china will get dominance over westpac. i mean, is not there guam, wake islands, haiwaii further west, and then nz and aus, not to mention japan and the 2nd island chain? 

f. regarding strategic importance of scs. from what i understand, us's interest in maintaining fon in scs lies primarily in trade (correct me if i am wrong). us would lose out a chunk if china achieves hegemonic status in sea, but in the grand scheme of things, its not something that will cripple us. i mean, us's 3 largest trading partners excluding china are the eu, mexico and canada. sea accounts for 6% of its world trade only.",1640189559.0,"['long', 'time', 'lurker', 'sub', '.', 'lot', 'talk', 'war', 'china', 'taiwan', ',', 'focus', 'fight', 'war', 'likely', 'taiwan', '+', 'u',

172,rmmcrf,What to do about Afghanistan?,,9,1.0,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rmmcrf/what_to_do_about_afghanistan/,10,"the country is literally crumbling before our eyes. the economy is tanking. banks are closed and limiting access to funds. foreign aid has been frozen. salaries are unpaid and unemployment is through the roof. 90% of the pop could face poverty by next year. 55% of the pop faces extreme levels of hunger, and an estimated 1 million children may starve to death this winter. the even more extremist isk has been mounting increased terrorist activity and is seeking to gain control. and conditions will likely get even worse. 

all international aid has been frozen. my hot take is that the us and intl. community may have to (unfortunately) work with the taliban, to avoid an even worse and more costly humanitarian disaster. if the taliban could agree to particular policy changes (such as rights of women to work and study, amnesty for previous government supporters, and international monitoring) then perhaps the us and allies could justify the distribution of aid, resources, and some recognition. this is a humanitarian disaster that will only get worse. and what happens if isk (isis) takes control? then we will likely have to engage in another expensive and violent intervention in the future. we may strongly dislike the taliban, but we have no power to affect change without engagement. i think the us and

174,rm0s06,Is Russia now in a similar situation as Germany in 1871-1914?,,103,0.84,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rm0s06/is_russia_now_in_a_similar_situation_as_germany/,69,"when modern germany was founded it found itself in the middle of things, strategically. the new nation was pincered between france on its western flank and zarist russia on its eastern flank. russia today has the eu in the west and china in the east. 

germany also had to face the british empire, the global superpower. today's russia faces the usa. 

germany was late in the colonial game, russia is late in its modern version, the ""war on terror"" (syria, lybia).

obviously, there are many differences as well. in particular, while germany was the strongest nation, economically and militarily, the same cannot be said for today's russia. also, trade relations are different nowadays.

nevertheless, i think one interesting conclusion from that comparison is that germany fared well as long as it managed to avoid a franco-russian or franco-british alliance. so russia would do well to prevent alignment between china and the eu (and ideally china and the usa, but that is hardly necessary) but also, most importantly, nato (the usa) and the eu. 

could that current action in eastern europe be understood as part of the latter strategic goal?  is it possible that putin is making offers directly to the usa in order to force a wedge between the eu and washington? could the long game be that nato is replaced by the eu in eastern europe because putin sees the eu as much less dangerous?",1640161802.0,"['modern', 'germany', 'found', 'found',
