But the communications team only consisted of 3 people. My boss and the director, and then, me. In the middle of November, I lost both of grandparents and my mental health depleted. My boss let me have 2 weeks during the holidays off (paid and non-paid days) and I was back to work by January. 

In comes being overworked. 

Being that the team I was apart of was small, the workload was heavy and each week the amount of work increased more and more and my mental health continued to suffer. My boss pulls me into a meeting and tells me to essentially don‚Äôt take off any days to ‚Äúsave my time‚Äù because she will not be able to give any LWOP for ‚Äúvacation‚Äù days. (This came out of no where and the days I had off before were from me losing the closest people in my life) 

The next week, she makes a bee-line into my cubicle and sits down and says: 

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so glad your here. I mean you come in on time and I‚Äôm just SO happy I have my life back. I was just telling people that I‚Äôm so happy I can go back to running on my lunch and I can go take breaks now. It feels so good not to be stressed anymore!! I just wanted to thank you for this.‚Äù 

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm staring at pile of work on my desk as she‚Äôs saying this üòë In that moment, I made the decision to quit and to get my mental health together. The next week, I put in my resignation letter üòò Hope you enjoy having your ‚Äúlife‚Äù back!",1646491024.0

Normal job office is open M-F only. After I told HR I wouldn‚Äôt stop bc it‚Äôs outside of office hours and not a conflict of interest (it‚Äôs not even close to the same field), an executive called me and said what‚Äôs in the title after explaining to me I was salaried exempt. I asked what could I be doing if the office is closed, he said I could spend time helping make the company better. Come up with new strategies or develop training for other departments. After expressing my shock at this and arguing a few minutes, I told him I quit. 

Sent my letter of resignation to HR right after I hung up with the exec. They tried to convince me to stay. When that didn‚Äôt work they explained to me how I could never find another employer that would pay me the same. 

Only took me a few weeks to find a new job. I make less in total now, but if you break down to an effective hourly I make much more per hour. No longer need to work 60+ hour weeks with a maniac ceo who gives out daily fire drills and expects you to drop everything to get something done for him. Have more time with my family. Less stress. In the end, I‚Äôm glad this happened. 

Fuck that old place.

Edit: Wow didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the comments. Many confirm even more I made the right choice!

Edit 2: To clarify I was doing work on the weekends in an area I am personally interested in. Nothing to do with the company or it‚Äôs industry at all. I didn‚Äôt do it for the money. I just happened to be getting paid for something I like doing. 

To those asking me to name the company sadly I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. They are known to be litigious even against Glassdoor reviews. 

To those who don‚Äôt believe me. Ok. No hard feelings. No matter what I say I can‚Äôt convince you otherwise so no need to argue about it.

* Every pro worker says 'capitalism is the only successful system.' As half of the world makes less than 5 dollars per day
* Ever pro worker seems to think that if there aren't wage slaves, society will collapse.

Hate to break it to you but 90% of jobs in America are unnecessary bullshit. Pizza hut doesn't need wage slaves for society to function. Pizza hut shouldn't exist if it requires slaves to run.

&#x200B;

* Every pro worker seems to think that the ultra rich are tony stark like geniuses that deserve to have wage slaves. They seem to worship them like literal deities and truly believe that people should be forced to serve them.
*  Every pro worker gets triggered by the term, 'wage slave' Even though real slaves like Frederick Douglas said wage slavery is just as horrific as being in chains.

What's funny is the same arguments they use to defend wage slavery are the exact same arguments people used to defend real slavery..

t767wi,"I tell a supervisor I'm burnt out and they write me up for INSUBORDINATION and put me on PROBATION. . . unfortunately for them, I am very difficult to replace right now.",,289,0.95,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t767wi/i_tell_a_supervisor_im_burnt_out_and_they_write/,70,"~~I am still very emotional about all of this so I am not going to try and be super detailed at this time.~~ This has taken place over the past 6 months and everything has come to a head over the last two days. It is still not over but should be by Monday.

**Revision**: *I ended going full tilt so ignore the struck line. Please let me know if I left ANY identifying information in here. I believe I have gotten it all.*

**tl/dr**: company tried to write me up for insubordination and now they are trying desperately to retain me because of a proprietary tool that I made and only I can use.

This all started about 6 months ago when an employee I worked very closely with (*CloseEmployee*) suddenly put in their 2 weeks' notice. I asked if they had a new job and they told me that they did not. I accepted the reason of needing to be closer to family and let it go. A month later my boss put in their resignation. I congratulated them and say, ""I hope you got that pay raise you were looking for."" He replied with, ""when I told them what my price was they said, 'That's *too low*, here's another **$10k**.'"" I was stunned because I had already thought what he was asking for was a significant bump based on our previous conversations.

That got me thinking about how much is what ***I do*** actually worth? After 5 more people left I decided that I had enough leverage to request promotion and/or a raise. To give you that dollar amount I have to explain one very important thing. I had created a custom actuarial tool that allowed you to import full claims histories, loss rate them without the need for historical premiums, and then models a full 3 year low, mid, and high projection of what we would expect the claims to be based on the trend. But wait, there's more! I had also built an entire rating module that could do everything the in-house rating system could do and then some. I had also built it in such a way that I could input our competitors' rates and use the tool to conduct price comparisons, seek out vulnerabilities in their rate manual, and model what their renewal business would be priced at so we could always come in lower. For the record, I have a Marketing degree so that fact alone should show you how hard I worked on this. I also did this *entirely in excel*... **WITH NO VBA CODE!** ^(ok just a lil' VBA for a button I swear!)

We started being able to rate BIG groups, millions of dollars in premiums, quickly AND accurately. They trusted it so much that they stopped using it to rate. If the suggested projected premium amount was above the mid projection with strong underwriting principles they would make the rate match in the system via discounting. Needless to say, it was valuable. The crux of this is that since it was so intricate essentially ***no one except myself could use it.*** I was the only person over 4 years that could input the claims, adjust everything, and manipulate the tool during presentations to management.

With this context in place, we can now get back to my initial question, ""*how much is what I do actually worth?*"" When it turned out to be north of $16 million in new premiums and equivalents of saved labor. I said to myself, ""I think I have a really good case here. I have done so much and made the company so much money."" There are also aspects to this of being snubbed for multiple promotions and essentially forgotten by management, but I will save those for another post at another time since this is still ongoing.

In my quarterly reviews, I had always listed the position I wanted to be promoted into and had been taking courses for an industry designation as well. All of this was known or should have been known by management, especially since they were paying for the courses. So when a position opened up 4 months ago I put in my application. When I told one of the AVPs that I wanted to be in that position that just became available, they were genuinely surprised. Their excuse was that I am not their direct report, so they did not look at my quarterly reviews. I said ok sure, that's reasonable. Then when I finally got to interview for the position I was told, ""You just need more time in your current position to continue ***learning***."" I pointed out that they themselves had just promoted someone from a *different department* to the exact same position *I* was applying to now. They never learned the system and how it worked so this clearly was a lie. their reply was, ""good point."" and they would not elaborate. Needless to say, I did not get the position.

At this point, I'm sure many of you would be furious. I was not, but I should have been. I should have quit right there and then after getting that kind of a reply. The interviewer may not have been within my direct report chain, but they had access to **ALL** of my reviews and work product. They had all of the information they needed, yet they lacked the moral compass to recognize their responsibility to me as an employer. I should have realized that they did not view me as a person who worked for them. They viewed me as something that needed to be *managed*; like they **owned** me.

By this point, I might've considered myself disgruntled. I put little effort into my work, didn't go out of my way to do things, and generally did the bare minimum. Months went by like this while my mental health slowly unraveled. I started taking my breakthrough anxiety medication almost every other day; I was having panic attacks frequently. I was not in a good place.

Then pops in my inbox for a request to set up the tool for a large group that came in. At this point, I broke down and started to cry. I couldn't handle setting anything up in the tool, I just couldn't. I had worked so hard to make it amazingly useful, yet I was seeing none of the rewards for my effort. I replied, ""I am burnt out on this. Can you see if someone else can do it."" It was the end of the day so I logged off and went home.

When logged on in the morning I had gotten an email from the VP with the AVP, VP of HR, and my boss cc'd on it. I was then told by the VP that my response was ""disappointing,"" and that I could have handled it better. In their eyes this clearly was all my fault. I could not believe that they had the audacity say that to someone who had just told them they were burnt out. I just didn't respond. They had asked no questions and did not indicate that they wanted a response. Regardless, I did not care.

The following day a ""**Workload Discussion**"" meeting popped up on my calendar with the VP of HR and my boss included on it. I rolled my eyes and thought, ""They're going to haul me in there and have a talk with me. They're going to ask if my workload was too much and that would be it."" Oh no, this wasn't to discuss my workload. This was to discuss my new ***on probation*** status due to my ***INSUBORDINATION!*** I keep saying this, but I once again was left stunned. In addition to this they led with, ""We are putting you on Probation for Insubordination and because of that we will be witholding your bonus until we deem you reformed."" Now this is where I could have told them to go fuck themselves with a splitery trowel.

Luckily for y'all I knew that something would be mentioned about my dissapointing email. So I had prepared a written statement. Not only did this statement address the burnout email and how I believed it was an unwarranted reaction. I had also written two more parts that covered ""*why is this causing me mental anguish and burnout?*"" and ""I*ssues with my job and management.*"" I have included these below with all identifying details removed.

Statement:

>!I said, ‚ÄúI am very burnt out on this‚Äù and suggested that someone else could help with the setting up the tool. I do not understand how this was a ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù response. Why should I go to my supervisor to discuss a direct request from another supervisor when they did not send it to me through my own supervisor? No one consults My Boss on my availability or time. My Boss knows my workload best, but this is not a workload issue; I am burnt out. Every time I get a request for the tool I either cry or get close to crying. It causes me mental anguish and I do not want to be forced to put myself through that. Especially if it is for something that is not listed in my job duties or covered partially under another job duty.!<

&#x200B;

>!Why is this causing me mental anguish and burnout?!<

>!I was one of a handful of people who submitted a Panel Project that was accepted. I spent over 800 hours developing the tool that we use on virtually all large group new business. The tool has played a big role in bringing in some of our largest groups, like BigAssGroup, and has been used in well over $14m worth of bound new business. The tool has also become indispensable for large renewals under review like EvenBiggerAssGroup. I also chased down the LargeAssGroup submission which has been quoted at over $1m. I have also brought in $300k in new business through Google AdWords (GAW) with a 500% ROI. GAW has performed so well that the budget was increased by management. I alone manage the strategy and budget for GAW without assistance from marketing.!<

&#x200B;

>!It would have cost over $160k to make something close to what the tool does from scratch. In fact, it cost $50k just to have an actuary vet and stamp-off on it. My name is mentioned frequently by the CEO during company meetings, my agents have directly requested that I remain on their accounts, and I am given accolades regularly for my work. None of this praise has materialized in any equitable way or has been noted in any of my reviews by management.!<

&#x200B;

>!I have never been written up or suggested for disciplinary action. (I said out loud, until now) I have always gotten raises that were above the median for performance and I have even gotten raises as high as 5%. I work well with just about everybody and I have always offered myself up for special projects and to help others. I have been taking courses towards designations as well, all approved by the VP. Despite all of this I have not experienced any inclusion in considerations for promotions, merit raises, or spot bonuses. (they do not have spot bonuses either!)!<

>!Three people were promoted directly to an the Position without allowing for anyone else to apply. The Transfers & Promotions section in the Employee Handbook says, ‚ÄúThe Company is committed to a policy of promotions from within on the basis of merit and has established a job-posting program to give all employees an opportunity to apply for positions in which they are interested and for which they are qualified.‚Äù It goes on to say, ‚Äú‚Ä¶vacancies below senior management level are normally posted via email to Company staff and posted on the Company website.‚Äù How am I supposed to have the impression that The Company values equity and inclusion when there were three back-to-back promotions with no opportunity to apply?!<

&#x200B;

>!I was told by an AVP/Manager, ‚ÄúWell now that we know you want to be in that Position,‚Äù even though I wrote that in as my major goal in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Does Management read my performance reviews? How were my career interests not known by anyone within Management? I feel as if Management has forgotten their responsibilities to me as an employee and neglected The Company's own guidelines. We were told to grow our industry knowledge, to take designation classes, to get licensed and that that would get us noticed and considered for promotions. Despite the near dozen special projects/accounts I have been on nothing like that materialized. !<

&#x200B;

>!A different AVP/Manager said that I, ‚Äúneeded more time in my current role‚Äù when applying for an the Position I wanted, despite the fact someone was just promoted from a different department to the Position with no experience or training. Nothing I currently do is listed on my job description. In fact a lot of the work I currently do is above my position AND the position I have applied for.!<

I felt that this was a powerful statement, that I was standing up for myself and explaining the context that led me to getting burnt out. I will say it again, I was stunned by the response the head of HR gave me. They said, ""In your job description it says, 'performs other duties as required."" I responded, ""So you are saying that  my entire work here at The Company is completely encompassed within those five words?"" My existence was five words. That's crushing.

After that initial exchange they went back and forth with me and  they eventually ended the discussion by telling me that I would be emailed a document to sign regarding my Insubordination, and that my status would be set as *on probation*. They also let me know that many people had been on probation and gotten off it, *and even gotten promoted!* ^(Oh joy, another free red flag!) I told them I would consider signing it after reading it. HR said by and they both disconnected. I was later that day sent the email to sign and after reading it I let my manager know that I would not be signing it and should just probably resign. He freaked out a little when I mentioned resignation; which shows how certain they were of their control over their employees. This was the first time someone had stood up to them, called them out, and did not care what they said the consequences were. My manager asked me to give him 24hrs if I was serious. I told him I would log in to work tomorrow and listen to what they had to say.

I also want to point out that the VP of HR stared at me slack faced and emotionless through my entire statement, while my voice waivered as I held back tears. Management was starting to look more and more like a Cartel of Psychopaths. They were here to use us to make them money and they did not care if we could survive on the pay, let alone invest in our own future.

The next day rolls around. I check their calendars to see if they have any meetings scheduled about me and when my next meeting would be with HR. They had a 45m meeting that was set to private; ok so they are actually going to go over the statement I made. I had sent them the text of the statement to review. They did not ask for this, I had to suggest that I send it over. The meeting starts, they use up the full 45 minutes, and then I notice that the meeting is still going and it ends up lasting nearly 2 hours. ""It seems like they are actually taking it seriously."" I think to myself. Then I get a new meeting invite labeled, **Workload Discussion**. Nope, they got me again. At that point I knew what this would be about. They wanted to save face, lay down their authority so that I knew who was top dog, and that they would most certainly not give me what I wanted, the promotion. They couldn't give a promotion to someone that had told them no; someone that sad, ""I won't take this anymore.""

Again you are lucky because at this point I did not care **AND** I was pissed. I realized how toxic this place was and that all of the warnings I had been given were true. So I decided to write a resignation letter in the form of a final statement. But before I get to that I need to tell you how that last meeting went prior to me reading my final statement to them.

The VP and my boss join the meeting and we exchange quick pleasantries before things begin. They start by saying, ""I want to make sure everyone is on the same page, and I know there was a resignation talk yesterday, I don't know if that's the way you want to go right now, I'm not sure. . ."" They left a long pause there for me to respond because they assumed I would ""*show my hand*"" just because they implied the need for an answer. I said, ""I wanted to hear what you had to say first before I answered that."" So they told me.

They said that I will not have to sign anything over this incident, but that my probation would still stand and that they hope we can move past this quickly; this also meant no bonus still. They also lets me know that they had already *been* working on something for me. if I would have *just* waited it would have happened, but it can **STILL** happen if I play ball and agree to their terms. When I ask them for details they told me that I would no longer be working under my current position, but a lateral position that is NOT the position I had asked for and that I would get the *Senior* title; *it would also not come with a pay raise since it was lateral*. Half of my work would still be above my paygrade as nothing that I do within that job description was related to the millions of dollars in premium that I had helped bring in. I mentioned this and said that I would like to be compensated for these other things that I do and because of all of the value I have brought The Company. I was told that the people that got into the Position I wanted to had *earned* it and that you can't be so negative and get promoted. They had ""*done the work*"" and been rightly promoted, I had not.

I told them multiple times in previous meetings and this one that I am very happy for everyone who got the promotion and that I do not believe they were unqualified to fill it. This circular argument went  on for awhile until I fully laid out my finances and how I was living over the last 5 years and how I still couldn't buy a house or anything else I wanted despite having saved nearly six-figures. Most of what I said during this conversation is covered in my Final Statement. I will come back and add any bits that I remember later that aren't covered in the Final Statement.

Final statement:

>!I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working for The Company over the past 5 years. I made some good friends, had some great mentors, and learned so much from all my colleagues. Although I am sad to have my employment with The Company end this way, it appears that this is the best option for me, both mentally and professionally. Before coming to The Company I was warned by multiple former employees of the work conditions here. Once I interviewed and accepted my original position, I decided that they were just disgruntled; everything seemed fine.!<

&#x200B;

>!I started to realize something was off when CloseEmployee left in the way they did, crushed, resigned‚Ä¶ defeated. When my boss left, I started to think back on the warnings I had been given. I asked myself, ‚ÄúDid I miss something? What am I not seeing here?‚Äù Then I started to review what I was doing, what my role was supposed to be, and how the compensation for what I was doing measured up; I found it extremely lacking. When I expressed my interest in being promoted to the Position I was told, ‚ÄúYou need more time in your current role,‚Äù and then ‚ÄúNow that we know you want to be in that position we can work towards it!‚Äù I started to realize that management did not care about my career goals. Whether through ignorance, neglect, or managerial ineptitude the results were the same. !<

&#x200B;

>!I reached out to some former employees and started asking them questions. What I was told surprised me. Our city releases a Median Family Income chart about every year. They use this chart to determine if you are extremely low, very low, low income, or meets cost of living standards. One of my colleagues was getting paid so little that they were considered very low income. Because of this they were able to get a 0% interest loan on property issued out by the city government. Another former employee told me their starting pay and where they ended up by the time they left. They were getting paid so little, that they were below the 50th percentile, considered Very low income, and qualified for rental assistance. They only got to the 60th percentile at the time of their departure. Despite having similar tenure (a month or two) and similar skillsets they were paid significantly less than what I currently make.!<

&#x200B;

>!I asked myself, ‚ÄúHow can such a successful company pay their employees so little? How could they not consider each employees situation and compensate them accordingly?‚Äù I was unable to find a reason. With our city being in the top 25 most expensive places to live in the nation and with one of the greatest scarcities of housing, I started to become upset. I was unable to make progress in my career let alone meet any of my personal life goals because the raises were insufficient. So, my options were to get a raise that broke even with inflation, get a less than 1% raise maybe, lose purchasing power due to inflation being higher than my raise, or to say something and ask for better working conditions. After talking with my boss, they took my concerns seriously and even discussed moving me into a new position yet to be named. That ended being a dead end as I did not hear anything back in well over a month.!<

&#x200B;

>!Burnout started to set in and when I let someone know that I was burned out I was reprimanded and charged with insubordination. I was not treated like a person, I was treated like and object, a problem. When I had my meeting with HR the first thing the VP of HR brought up is that my Bonus would be withheld until they deemed me reformed. I let the VP of HR know that I do not care about my bonus at this point, I am burnt out. When I mentioned that nothing, I currently do is in my job description they said, ‚ÄúIn the job description it says, ‚Äúperforms other duties as requested.‚Äô‚Äù So, my entire role and duties are encompassed by ‚ÄúPerforms other duties as requested?‚Äù I was shocked they could say something like that to me. They showed me no empathy, just cold calculated disdain. I was a problem, not a person.!<

&#x200B;

>!I have watched many people leave The Company over the past 6 months, I now understand why. There are pay disparities that go beyond differences in tenure. I will be leaving effective immediately under the Workers Code Quit clause for, ‚Äúquitting for good cause connected with work,‚Äù which means that I have a work-related reason that would make me want to remain employed but that I feel the need to leave employment. The specific reason is that there was a ‚Äúsignificant change in my hiring agreement,‚Äù as reinforced by the VP of HR's statement. This qualifies me for unemployment, and I hope that this will not be contested by The Company. I would also like my bonus to be paid out because my bonus reflects the quality work and my job performance in 2021, not 2022. !<

&#x200B;

That final statement was only heard by my manager because the VP had to go to an appointment. I am set to meet with them Monday because they said, ""*just take this Friday and the weekend to cool down and let's regroup Monday.*"" Now after reading all of this I am sure some of you are angry on my behalf. Don't be. It is my own fault because I should have left MONTHS ago. I would even argue that it isn't managements fault either and I will tell you why.

I kept thinking and pondering wanting to know why they would treat me and my colleagues this way. I have worked with these people for five years and they are all great people. The VP truly cares when someone is having trouble or not feeling well. They would regularly give me shakes and food if they saw me working through lunch. Someone had cancer and they fronted way more PTO than they ever were required to. But I still couldn't square how they could be so nice on the outside, but when it came to me they could treat me like crap. But then it dawned on me, and it was like I had unlocked secret knowledge.

***They were taught to do this...*** They were taught by the previous management team, and they in turn were taught by their previous management team, and so on and so on to the beginning of time\*\*\*.\*\*\* They weren't being this way on purpose, this was just what they were *taught*. This was a ***learned survival instinct*** that ***companies*** had evolved over thousands of years doing business. Just recently technology had advanced far enough to use computers to tell us what to do, to tell us exactly where to squeeze to get more money. The technology and the math did not lie. It told them that in order to make the MOST money, you HAVE to cut costs, and the biggest cost of all is usually labor. So that's what happened, natural selection, they cut labor costs.

A lot of people think /r/latestagecapitalism is overblown, but it is real. This is our future. If something does not change hundreds of millions will suffer over the next few decades. I do not care about parties or the politics around how we get out of this. I want out. I want change. I want people to understand how manipulated they are by *the money* and that *money* controls everything. If we want to save ourselves we have to eradicate the *money* from influencing our quality of life. No more money in politics, no hidden donations, no generations of wealthy representative that server for 20, 30, or 40 years and pass laws that in turn make them even richer. Also, no more insider trading by the people we elected to serve in our best interests. If they have interests in corporations, they will heed those interests in addition to our interests. They should **ONLY** be heeding **OUR** interests. If there is a way to make more money, you know people will do it. The only reason they don't kill you to get there is because we have laws.

This isn't hard to do. Stop being lazy. Call your reps and be active. I am already losing so much hope and this feels like my last try at this before I just resign myself to the system. I hope this reaches a few people and that they heed my call.

Goodnight.",1646473990.0

This email is offering a professional development opportunity that takes place in the summer. It is a 5 day, 9-5 workshop. 

There is no compensation for this whole week of extra work, but how nice of them to offer to at least cover the registration fee (sarcasm).

So I have 2 choices

1. Attend a week long seminar, unpaid (actually more than unpaid considering I would need to find childcare), and learn new skills to better my instruction and improve student learning.

Or

2. Do not attend and not learn valuable teaching techniques that would impact my students. 

So the public school system wants me to be a better teacher but wants me to do it on my own time.

The school system does offer a few days of paid professional development throughout the year, but only to meet the required minimum the state requires. Any bonus development is at your own cost of time and money.

Things like this go on all them time. Another example that happened to me this week is that I realized I need new speakers for my school computer so that I can show the kids videos, or listen to songs. The speakers I have now were purchased out of my own pocket, and are just cheap speakers from Walmart. I decided to ask the tech guy to see if maybe the district would give me some, and he literally laughed when I inquired. 

I can can afford new speakers, but why should I have to? 

I honestly think many of us have been brainwashed into believing this kind of treatment is normal. I am trying to break these beliefs, but I‚Äôm not going to lie, it‚Äôs hard. I feel guilt, anxiety, and fear that my actions will harm students. It‚Äôs some weird version of Stockholm syndrome where they‚Äôve conditioned teachers to believe that we are the problem, and if we just work harder, put in more time, and just care more then our students will achieve success.

I know this is a bit of a rant, so I apologize. I just thought this is a place where someone might see my side. Thank you",1646492159.0

I worked for a factory that made brake components for companies like Honda, Nissan, and Kia as a temp on a ""fast track"" to be hired on full time. It was supposed to be maybe three months on this program, but I was in it for over a year and a half with no one approaching me to be hired on.... just one of the many things that made me hate this job. 

Anyway, this story isn't about that. It's about the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back which made me quit with a very satisfying F.U. moment.

I had been injured on the job. We had a conveyor belt on our line that didn't work, a work order was submitted to maintenance two months prior and we were simply sliding the parts down the line with some force. Eventually, that was going to cause an injury and it just happened to me. I caught my hand between on of the machines and this heavy ass caliper, splitting the side of my hand open. A LOT of stitches were required.

As is customary in the U.S., I was drug tested at the clinic they took me to and I passed. Doc said DO NOT use that hand. The chemicals we worked with would have made things so much worse. TWO days after the incident, I get popped for a ""random"" drug test. Again, I passed. I knew what was up... I was being targeted. TWO days after the ""random"", I was told that one of my co-workers on my line was going on vacation and I'd have to use the hand to do his job. I said ""Nope. Doctor's orders"".  And here's were the lies came in...

Thirty minutes go by and both the F.T. supervisor and Temp supervisor tried to tell me that they had spoken to the doctor. I knew better. That would've been a HIPPA violation. Doc ain't talking to anybody but me. 

Then they started feeding me lines about my continued employment being in jeopardy if I didn't. So I said ""Fine"", but I already decided right there that I was done. 

I waited until night before the co-worker was to go on vacation. The other guys on my line knew of my plan. Finished my shift, clocked out, found both the supervisors, and said ""I just wanted to tell you both that you're both lying pieces of shit and to go fuck yourselves"".... and I walked.  I'm not ever allowed to go back to work for them, but I don't care. It was worth it.",1646501218.0

Original post: https://redd.it/t5y9s1
tldr, I was sick of my boss's temper and disrespect and I walked out with plans of resigning.

First this is the resignation email I sent to the 2 execs this morning:


*[Names],*

*After careful consideration I am resigning from my position at [company] effective immediately. While I regret the circumstances, my decision is based on the unmet standards of respect and professionalism in the workplace and considered final.*

*My key card will be mailed to the office on today's date.*

*Regards*

A couple hours later I got a call from the President who's the older of the two brothers. He's not the one that set me off yesterday but he's been equally insulating and I generally don't like him. 

Surprising convo, he said he respects my decision and that although I did not give a notice he would still vouch for me as a reference. 
He also assumed my reason for quitting was that I worked on an inventory issue where I got a little dirty. I told him my reasons were exactly what I stated in my email and I went into some brief examples which of course he denied and made excuses. At the end he said that as long as I don't badmouth the company I'd be in his good side and that his brother may have a different reaction.

Part of our duties was unloading the nightly delivery trucks.

We were all scheduled 40 hrs, but sometimes the trucks would take a little longer to unload.  So, if we were due out at a certain time, but the trucks weren't fully unloaded, we stayed until they were.

If we hit OT, we were paid for it, so it wasn't really an issue... Until it was.

We got a new kid on the crew (let's call him Scott). Scott was nice and a decent worker, but he didn't work a full 40 hr schedule because he was a student.  When Scott's shift was over, he was gone.  Didn't matter if the truck was done or not.

It didn't bother us because we had enough guys on the team to cover, Scott was nice, worked hard, and we knew the deal when they brought him in. 

Well, I was offered an opportunity to work a 2nd job at a nightclub in town on weekends. I could really use the extra cash.  The problem was, one night a week, I would have to leave my 1st job an hour early.

I had roommates & friends on that crew and they all encouraged me to talk to the store manager (let's call him Mike).  So I go to Mike and tell him I need to talk about my schedule... And before I could get the rest out, he tells me to take it up with my direct supervisor/assistant manager (let's call him Tim).

So I go to Tim and explain the situation. After some confirmation and talking with my team, he says I'm good.

Things were great for months, until one night we got an extra truck and the crew needed to stay later than normal, and the store manager happed to be there.

Mike noticed that I wasn't there, but saw me leaving. He asked the crew what was up, and they told him I left for my 2nd job.  Dude was pissed.  The next night, I got called into Mike's office to explain why I walked out on my shift and had been doing so for months.

I reminded him that he was the FIRST person I came to, but he didn't want to hear it. Told me to talk to Tim and Tim ok'd.  Manager calls Tim in, and blasts Tim for letting me walk on a shift when they needed me.

But Tim had my back. He said it was one hr a week, I was still putting in 40 hrs and the team was cool with it.  Besides, Scott only works two full shifts a week and leaves much earlier the other 3 nights. What's the problem with one hour? 

Mike says that this was different because Scott was in college, but I was ""only"" working a 2nd job, so this job should be first priority. 

Tim, God bless him, had my back. He asked Mike if had noticed any dip in production from my shift. Mike said 'No', so Tim asked him what the problem was... Mike just mumbled about keeping him apprised of things like this in the future.

TL;DR - Store manager was okay with a college student taking off early from shifts multiple times a week because he was a student and that was 'important', but pissed that I was taking off an hour early one night per week to 'only' work a 2nd job.",1646495950.0

I learned how to drive tractors, dump trucks, skid steers. It was basically farm work. It was really hard. I‚Äôm 6 feet tall and back then weighed about 145 lbs. I was not strong. I felt like Conan the barbarian on the Wheel Of Pain. Hard physical labor through 100 degree humid temperatures into the late fall and freezing snowy days. I still remember how desperately hungry I was all the time. We‚Äôd have eating contests at lunch to see who could pack down the most 12‚Äù hoagies in our half hour lunch break. We started at 7:00 and ended at 5:30. Most of the summer was 6 days a week. Over time I became friends with the guys at work. We had a ‚Äúsoda‚Äù machine at our shop that was stocked with Budweiser. On Saturday we‚Äôd all get drunk and fuck around racing our cars around the tree nursery until we got stuck in the mud. I distinctly remember one day the boss had me demo a concrete patio with a sledgehammer. I broke up the pieces, load them into the bucket of the tractor and dump them in the dump truck. I managed to haul out over 8 tons of concrete in a ten hour day. I got a 25 cent raise. I was making $7.50/ hr in 1989. I still lived at home and could kick in something for my family. I had been so miserable in high school. So physically constrained on cut off from nature. It was unbearable. With my work, I was so much healthier, stronger, more confident, happier than I had ever been in school. Looking back now, I realize I have pretty bad ADHD and dyslexia. Back then I was just stupid and ‚Äúnot working to my potential‚Äù in school. I know this is way too long, but I have a point. 

My point is that now, at 52, I‚Äôm still working. Im a union plumber and still have very physically demanding days. I also am very interested in this antiwork movement. The stories I read here are really depressing. The labor movement and unions in America helped build a thriving middle class. And much of that good work has been undone by demonizing unions and denigrating physical work. I support strong unions and strong worker protections. I support telling your boss to go fuck himself and walking off a job. I support taking a sick day at least every 6- 8 weeks just because. 
But I am sad that work itself has been cast in a negative light. Hard physical work has been a consistent factor in my adult life. It has provided a contrast that makes a soft chair or relaxed day feel so much better. It has built friendships and brotherhood with my fellow workers. When you suffer through something hard together it naturally brings people closer together. And it reveals who we are in that adversity. It‚Äôs been really rewarding for me at every level. I hope I won‚Äôt be misunderstood here. I just believe that most of the complaints in r/antiwork can be solved through unionizing and improving workers rights. The people who seek to exploit us think they are above working. They think they are not supposed to have a sore back or a callous.

my friend-now-coworker helped me get a job at a retail store. I don‚Äôt hate it, but I don‚Äôt plan to stay there forever. my goal is to work in a pharmacy, and while I don‚Äôt mind staying in my position, I won‚Äôt hesitate to resign if given the opportunity I want. 


I‚Äôve expressed some of this to my coworker, so he‚Äôs well aware I don‚Äôt have intentions of moving up in positions here. I‚Äôm here to do my job with good quality and get along with everyone. he, on the other hand, is adamant about rising ranks and maybe down the road, owns that store. that‚Äôs his goal, I‚Äôm not getting in the way of it or judging him by any means, my only critique is he doesn‚Äôt own a car. he has no guarantee or chance of getting a higher position like manager unless he has his reliable form of transportation‚Ä¶ and I happen to be his main source of transportation.

that being said, recently he‚Äôs been telling me (more so expecting of me) that if I wanna get on our manager‚Äôs good side, we should get in an hour early so, get this, not to look professional or act like we care, *because the manager likes to leave early.* Sorry, what? so he essentially wants me to take him and me to work early just so the manager doesn‚Äôt have to stay his entire scheduled shift. shit still makes me so mad. if you‚Äôre gonna kiss toes at least contribute something to the fucking story, not someone‚Äôs laziness. I go in when I'm instructed and I leave it at that. 

I‚Äôm particularly livid about this whole thing because the cherry on top is he told me this at the same time he knew that last week, my mom got in a serious accident from having a seizure at the wheel. she can‚Äôt drive anymore, and I‚Äôm her source of transportation. he expects me to prioritize taking him to work early for impression over me using my time off to HELP MY MOM.

(Example: A police officer gave him a speeding ticket and was arrested one week before his traffic court date causing his case to be thrown out.)

He was fired just a few days before Christmas and this was when I was out of a job as well. I had planned to buy him presents literally the day he got fired but quickly changed my mind when he came home from work 6 hours early. This was really the nail on the coffin of a miserable 6 months where my husband was promised commission pay, but his manager always found the smallest reasons to put it off for an additional month. Then once this manager finally confirmed he would get commission, he was fired only 3 days after. Husband thought about all the reasons he supposedly got fired for, but as it turns out, this company essentially decided after hiring two additional staff members, they were spending too much money on people‚Äôs salaries. They fired three people at once to keep the new hires and wiped out an entire department.

We were miserable for 2 months running back and forth from interviews. During this time we found out that this manager had passed his long term hire on a promotion because her name ‚Äúwas too black‚Äù and ‚Äúclients didn‚Äôt like that‚Äù. He gave the promotion to one of the new hires. This new hire had casually mentioned he was gay in conversation and was fired a few days later. This brought up talk of a previous employee, also a gay man, fired months back. Recently, he hired several more people and fired the only person that has been working the entire time at this location, presumably going back to her being ‚Äútoo black‚Äù.

His entire office is in shambles with little to no business since the firings happened. Not so surprisingly, every person this manager had fired, including my husband, were primary sources for business acquisition and retention. The manager took down my husband‚Äôs Glassdoor review citing it as false (it wasn‚Äôt), causing 4 more bad ones to pop up. The company could no longer cover up this manager‚Äôs racist and homophobic tirade and finally fired him. There are talks that this entire location may be shut down.

t7aezs,Losing Control in Your Personal Life Leads to Abusing it in Your Work,,25,0.95,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7aezs/losing_control_in_your_personal_life_leads_to/,3,"I have been studying psychology for over 10 years and have a master's in industrial organizational psychology. One thing that is pretty universal is that people desire control. It's mainly based on safety in an evolutionary sense. If you lack control, that means someone else has it, and they can dictate your fate.

A great example of this is police officers. Most police officers are raised in strict households. They grow up with authoritarian parents who are controlling and demanding. So they learn power dynamics at an early age. When they grow up, they seek the power that their parents held over them. A lot of it is, ""now it's my turn."" Again, they feel safer knowing they are in control. This is also bullying 101 right here. A bully's behavior is directly correlated to this parenting style. 

Authoritative parenting is different because it utilizes  authority, it doesn't abuse it. This is much better for development and growth in children because it is not a power dynamic. It is a cooperative dynamic. So an authoritarian parent might demand that their child do chores because they are the parent and you need to listen to them. But that is not a reason. That teaches the child nothing but that they should listen to orders and not think. An authoritative parent would teach the child the value of hard work, and maybe do the chore with them the first time. Make it fun with them. Teach by modeling. It is the best way to teach someone. Show them what to do. This is what good parents do. They don't try to be above their children, they are working with their children and empowering them. Now, it's also important to note that this is not a magical solution to make children listen to everything you say. They yell and scream, they cry and pout. They're kids, it happens. So you do have to be firm in these situations, but you need to balance it out with love and respect. This is a huge point for good managing styles. You have to lay down the law sometimes, but you don't belittle your employee and make them feel small. What are the next steps to improving? 

Ok so connecting this to work, you can see a clear difference in managers who live by authoritarian tendencies and those who live by authoritative tendencies. Unfortunately authoritarian people have that seed of power dynamics planted within them. They have been taught that power is important, so they seek it out. This is why bad people are always in charge. They have the hunger for control within them because they lack it. It's a bad cycle, and anytime you deal with a bad manager, you should remember this. I would bet that managers you've known with this trait have messy personal lives too. Troublesome kids, divorces, substance abuse. It's all connected. 

The best way to deal with them is exactly what this subreddit does. It exposes them and resists their bullying. That's what it is, they are bullies. Police are bullies. Even most politicians are bullies. Take the power away from them and make them feel weak. Don't feed into their power trip. Basically I just want to give my seal of approval for everything this subreddit does, and I also want to recognize those authoritative managers who are killing it.

I make $16/hr at an office job, which is high for this area and what people around here think is a living wage. All my credit cards are maxed out from previous times. Every time I manage to pay them down i end up having to use it again. Anyway, I missed two days out of this pay period for things out of my control (a medical issue and am ice storm literally breaking off my windshield wipers after I spent 40 minutes getting all the ice off preparing to drive in dangerous conditions like everybody else). The thing is, I could have worked from home that day, as I had from March 2020 until September '21, doing quantifiable work that's sent to two other people at another location and is easily verifiable, but I was denied by the current manager because I couldn't physically clock in. This was completely arbitrary and a new ""rule"" that was literally made up on the spot and the first time it was told to me.  But it is what it is. So now I have two days missing. We got paid Thursday, my entire paycheck is gone by Friday when the first of my bills come out. I had to postpone 2 that allow it (you can move it with no penalty as long as it's within 2 weeks of the original due date) but I still have some, including car insurance, that I can't postpone. But there's nothing in my account to pay them and nothing I can do about it. I had $80 left on one card so I plan to use that for gas and I dunno. If I didn't live with my SO, I probably wouldn't be able to eat. 
This is their living wage. It's basically a slave wage, the kind where you come in sick or in dangerous conditions because you have to. Because if you miss even the smallest amount of time, you can't afford to live.

This has been a long time coming. I (27M) have worked in healthcare for 10 years now as a custodian. Because I absolutely loved working in the hospital environment, I went and got my BSHS when I was 18 so one day I could work *with* patients, but apparently that wasn't good enough to be able to, so I've been stuck in Environmental Services for years. I've bounced around a few hospitals in my time, but I've been at this place for 2 years now, working in the Operating Rooms cleaning up car accidents, gun shots, any kind of trauma, and routine surgeries. I actually love the job, as gross as it sounds, and I loved the people I worked alongside. 

The management was disgustingly piss poor though. From DAY 1, when I accepted the job and quit my other job, it was *supposed to be* for first shift (7am-3:30pm) but two days before I started, they told me that position was already filled so I could work 2nd shift (3pm-11:30pm). I reluctantly agreed since I had already did my two weeks at my other job and was sitting on my ass at home. They also told me after 15months I could request transfer to another shift or apply to other departments. I am a morning person and let me tell you, it was very hard getting adjusted to 2nd shift. I felt like a zombie the entire two years I spent there. You get home around midnight and you get that 2nd burst of energy and end up staying up until 4-5am, doing nothing of course because all you can do in those hours is watch tv and snack. Then I would sleep in until at least noon and it was time to get ready for work again. I like to be productive. I like to work on the house, cook, draw, play music, but there was just simply no time to do anything productive unless I massively reworked my sleep schedule, which I tried and failed. 

Anyways, then COVID started. I started hearing about COVID during my last two weeks at the old job, and started the new one just in time for the shit storm. I was in my probationary period so I couldn't call off at all, but for some reason the hospital thought it would be a good idea to take away attendance points for calling off because they wanted to make sure nobody was coming in with COVID. What resulted was all the people who had been there for years to start using their sick time, sans attendance points. Most of them just never came back. We lost over half our staff because nobody wanted to risk their lives of their families lives for this shitty job. I don't blame them. This resulted in mandates. They would be allowed to *make you stay to work another 8 hour shift* if anyone from the next shift called off. I tolerated this. I hated it, but I did it a few times. They implemented ""x5 overtime"" if you worked 40 hours of OT, which told me they were not planning on hiring anyone else, instead they were just going to tempt everyone who was stupid enough to stay to sign up for OT. 

Then in October of last year my Dad passed away, from what he thought was long COVID but was actually advanced pneumonia. I still live with my parents, and I am the only child and this destroyed us. They were the forever and ever type, and he was the best dad and role model I could ask for. They gave 3 days bereavement per ""union policy"". If I wanted more time they told me to ask for vacation donations from other coworkers. I ended up huffing and puffing to the manager to get 5 days (40hours), but it was a struggle to even get the time. And it's the last thing you want to worry about when you are trying to grieve. My mom also works at a hospital and they told her take as much time as you need (they aren't union). It took them over 2.5 months for them to pay me, and even that was a struggle to get through because it was Christmas, the first one without my Dad. That was the last straw in my eyes, I wanted to quit then, but I really had no back up job and I heard there was going to be openings on first shift, so I stuck it out.

Finally, 3 open positions for first shift. A job I would love. I wouldn't have to deal with the worst person I have ever met in my life as my direct supervisor any more (a 22 year old girl who actually brought a bunch of 40, 50, and 60 year olds who have been working there 20+ years into a room together just to tell them they should be looking up to her as a mentor.. who continually breaks HR and HIPAA protocol and goes *out of her way* to make everybody pissed off). Since a lot of people quit I actually had seniority over quite a lot of people there, including a couple that works together in my department. I applied for all 3 positions and was told by the manager that the positions needed to be open for at least a week before I would know anything. However, because hospitals are apparently a better source for gossip than a middle school, I started hearing rumors that the manager had been calling people down to the office to ask if they wanted the first shift position, including the couple that works together in my department (they both have less seniority than me). Not only was it the manager, but it was the first and second shift supervisors doing this as well. And they did it with the subtlety of a baboon, because all of a sudden everybody knew about it and apparently the jobs were already filled, they were just lying to me and others who applied for it, and let it sit ""open"" for a week just to make it look like they gave others a chance. They were also going around telling everyone that I wasn't being considered for the job because I had attendance write ups, which resulted from me taking a few days to grieve about my Dad. 

I was obviously furious as were a couple other people who got wind of what management was doing. I reported the manager and the two supervisors to HR and the ethics committee for lying to me, for preferential treatment, intimidating workers, and for telling other coworkers my personal information. I also reported the couple that works in my department for being in a relationship and receiving preferential treatment. The girl had lied to my face at least five times when I asked her if they were applying for first shift, or if management had talked with them about it. The guy, who I actually really like, told me right to my face it was happening because he didn't understand why it was wrong of management to do such a thing (he's from Africa). In the past, management has changed their schedules, switched their weekends, changed their shifts, and got them in the same department to accomodate their relationship, while at the same time telling people like me that they couldn't make any changes to schedules. 

My Dad always advised me not to burn bridges and to always give two weeks, which I always have because of him, even though I have wanted to walk out of several places. I just couldn't do it this time. Although I wanted to walk into the office and take a shit right on the desk, I simply clocked out one last time, turned in my badge, pager, and parking, and told them I wouldn't be returning, and that they would all be hearing from HR soon. As far as I know a ton of people reported their behavior and someone will have to do something about it, I simply don't care anymore. I don't have any jobs lined up but I do have a bit of savings. My mom and friends understand and were happy to hear I left. I'll figure something out. Just wanted to get that off my chest, figured this is a good place to do it. 

 Healthcare is truly fucked up in the US, I have learned a lot in my 10 years about how hospitals are actually run (for-profit and no fucks given about patients). They cut corners and fix budgets in the dumbest of ways to save pennies but they have no problem overcharging an elderly lady for her pills, or performing treatments that they know won't work to rack up a bill. They will do anything to get rid of medical and financial liability. They will do it to anyone. That's fine when you are McDonald's but not fine when you are a hospital. The people I worked with were some of the most genuine and best people I have ever met. But the US healthcare system has actually managed to take an intelligent, motivated young man, who wants to help people, burn him out and make him run as far away from healthcare as he possibly can. My heart goes out to healthcare workers and patients everywhere. I know their pain. For me, I think I will get into tattooing. I'm really passionate about my art. It's something my Dad backed me up on ever since I was a little boy. I told him I wanted to be a tattoo artist when I was 16, and instead of telling me to grow up, go to school, and get a job, he went out and bought me 3 tattoo guns and told me to cover him as practice. His death has made me completely reevaluate how I spend my time here on Earth. I can tell you it won't be spent rotting away working my nights in a hospital. Thank you Dad.",1646503457.0

Job A is what I go to school for and will continue doing higher education (dog training = constantly getting more certifications) while Job B is a hobby job that I LOVE to do. Job A has paid me 12.50 hourly since I started over a year ago while Job B started me at 13.50 and has raised me to 14.50 without even being there 6 months. They are also negotiating another raise for me to be able to work Job B full-time so I can comfortably quit Job A.


 I was already considering leaving Job A due to the bosses having profit > wellbeing mindsets, crippling sales goals, being subjected to record cringey training videos despite severe anxiety, and many more toxic things. They also never enforced covid vaccines, social distancing, or masks in any kind of way throughout the pandemic for both employees and customers so there has been MANY covid outbreaks at my work.


Anyway, one of my favorite coworkers is quitting because the owners suck and don't care about our live animals, she let me know she was HIRED for $18 hourly.

So in short, if I kept my easier job, and got the full 8% I‚Äôd be earning the same amount of money right now as I am doing the harder, more stressful job. 

When asked HR why they do it that way, they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not realistic to get a 12% raise in one year.‚Äù So basically, I (and everyone else who got promoted in 2021) got royally screwed.

Now I know why all my coworkers do the bare minimum. It‚Äôs easier and you get paid the same in the end. 

Tl;dr: I got promoted this past year and my merit increase was slashed as a result.",1646511755.0

We manage property for out of state owners, these 2 had been sitting empty for a while due to the owner not answering my emails. My boss made it clear that I am to email everyone with vacant property every Friday. I was totally on board, tbf he has mentioned a couple times I need to stay on top of follow ups. But with how busy we've been with 700 new properties in the last year alone on top of the 1200 we already managed, it slipped my mind

The meeting went ok at first, but my boss kept going on about it and working himself up. Finally he commented that if it kept happening they'd have to offer these clients discounts and ""take it from my pay"". This is where I finally chimed in stating such a thing is illegal. This set him off ""Jesus fucking Christ you gotta be kidding, after everything we've done for you! Don't come at me with that shit! If this keeps up we can just fire you instead!""

I nearly walked out of the office, but I kept my mouth shut. I was promoted to this position after their last guy quit, and I turned my department into a well oiled machine after cleaning up the shit pile my predecessor left me. I'm 10x more productive than he was, and I worked a lot of free overtime when I started so to get things caught up (salaried).

I fully planned on giving them notice I was looking for a new job soon due to burnout, and then giving them a full month notice after that. They have been better to work for than any other company I've ever been with. But when they brought up docking my pay, withholding commission, and firing me for simply not following up with every single empty property, they shot themselves in the foot with me.

t7ci32,It‚Äôs finally time,,11,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7ci32/its_finally_time/,3,"This is long, but I‚Äôm at a kid‚Äôs volleyball tournament and I have a  lot of time. 

For the last six years, I‚Äôve worked for a very large, worldwide, multi-divisional chemical company in their sales division. About 95% of my day is spent servicing our dispensing equipment and dishwashers at customer sites (if you‚Äôve ever worked in a restaurant or hotel, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the company).

From 2016-2020, I was mainly focused on sales (minor service) and mostly paid on commission. In 2018 and 2019, I made about $80k each year - despite losing corporate customers worth 50k in 2019 (decision made at the corporate level - all my customers under those umbrellas loved me). About 15% of my budget. I was able to find those extra sales to break even. 

Pandemic hits, and they give us pay protection for the first six months or so.  Income definitely fell, but when you depend on restaurants to be busy, and they‚Äôre not open at all, that can be expected.

September of 2020, EVERY field rep in the US HAD to be on a several hours long teleconference with only about two hours notice. We were told that two divisions (doing the same thing) were being combined in an ‚Äúexciting opportunity to grow.‚Äù The roles were being split into service (territory representative - TR) and sales. Sales would be further divided into new sales and existing sales (I‚Äôm simplifying a bit). 

Lots of details, but to make the main points:
-EVERYBODY would have to apply for and interview for new positions 
-TR role (which I wound up getting) would be paid hourly, with pay based on what you made in 2019
-Service and sales would be ‚Äúequal‚Äù in terms of hierarchy
-There would be attrition in the ‚Äúmid to high single digits‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how things actually happened:
-Pay - I don‚Äôt remember what the hourly pay initially was, but Based on 2019, it SHOULD have been $38.46/hr (80,000/2080 hours for the year). My offer was in the low 20s/hr because they based the work week on 48 hours which would come out to 52 with overtime. If you do the math, that only comes to the mid-40s for the year. The difference would be made up in selling 300% of my monthly budget! The company quickly realized they screwed up royally and hourly pay was increased twice in the first few months to where I‚Äôm making $26.63 an hour. I have to work 52 hours a week to make the 80k that I was. If I take a sick day, it winds up costing me about $200. 

-Attrition. Right off the bat, probably about 25% off the field wasn‚Äôt hired back. Probably another 10%refused to take the jobs that were offered. There were several with 15+ years of experience that were offered under $20/hr. My district has been understaffed since the beginning, which makes more work for everyone.  We we fully staffed for, literally, two weeks, and one guy just quit last week (he was pretty bad at the job though). This means that I‚Äôm on call (weekends and nights) that much more often. Which means missing out on family things or even just getting things done around the house. My wife is NOT a fan of this. 

-‚ÄúHierarchy‚Äù after being told that the sales and service sides were equal, our yearly ‚Äúpat the upper management on the backs meeting‚Äù revealed this to not be the case. I brought that up immediately, and was told ‚Äúthis has always been the case.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt, and I had my manager pull up the initial presentation rolling this all out that proved otherwise. He tried to argue, saying that ‚Äúyou had to interview for the sales jobs.‚Äù 
Well, [manager], we had to interview for the service jobs too. 
‚ÄúOh, yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù
I feel like any chance for advancement is gone after that

The final nail, was when our area manager (i really feel like this is Initech with all the layers of management), said, ‚ÄúI know because of Covid, all of you guys had to work more hours‚Ä¶‚Äù
No, you twat, it‚Äôs because of the stupid ass decisions this company made to save a buck coming back to bite us all in the ass. 

The bright spot at the end of the (admittedly long) story is that I‚Äôm negotiating with a new company, and I‚Äôm looking to start soon. With a company that based its pay on a 40 hour fucking week!

I feel bad that me leaving will make things worse for the guys that I work with. They‚Äôre awesome, and the one thing I‚Äôm going to miss. Otherwise, I‚Äôm REALLY looking forward to an exit interview, and laying it all out there.

This took me back to last year. I left my job as a call center Supervisor at the end of March 2021. I was there 10 years but after a merger, things changed... for the worse. Any case, the pandemic happens and around April 2020, several of people who reported to me were in contact with someone  that tested positive for COVID. This was a no go since my oldest has Chronic Lung Disease (born with it) and my spouse has an auto immune disease (didnt matter, I ended up getting covid August 2021). I told them I was uncomfortable due to this and went home (left the office). After fighting they finally permitted work at home. AFTER docking me a week vacation for heading home and continuing to work remotely. Fine. Whatever. I did it for safety.

Fast forward to February, at this point working remotely, I was averaging 60-80hrs a week. This was because though the structure SHOULD be 15ish or less employees per Supervisor, I was averaging 20-26. This was because a lot in my role left when they saw the treatment. I was persistent, hoping my effort would pay off. A lot of them had performance issues and in between write ups and research to substantiate the write ups, it was a lot of work. Including - reviews. I always averaged higher during review time. In February our Director and VP hold a conference with my team (10 ish Supervisors) and it was expressed that since we were remote, we should put in MORE TIME since we don't drive into the office (some supervisors remained in office). I said, ""I have kids and Im already doing 60 or more a week. This isnt feasible"". The response ""You have a spouse dont you? They can take care of the kids. You are salary and a leader, you have to expect you will give more to the company when necessary"". FUCK THAT. I responded ""That's not happening"". They then suggest that my manager and I meet with them next week to discuss. 

After this meeting, I requested to speak with my manager. I said ""I know teams are changing at the end of March. I will stick around till then, but I am done. I am giving my notice"". They asked what prompted it, I told them the blatant disrespect to my time and my family was over. I already got docked vacation for my kids safety (she wasnt my manager when this happened and seemed shocked at this). And I wasnt about to give even more time."" She understood and I subsequently left. I pursued other endeavors but eventually took a job with a different company that seems a lot better. Definitely seems more respectful of my time.

My CEO and senior management group takes questions of any staff member and answers them in front of all staff.

I have been asking questions in the past and I received (surprise surprise) very political answers, meaning lots of talk without saying anything. I even tried a clear ""yes or no"" question but it's the same bs...can't get shit out of them even if you are trying to squeeze them. 

Anyway, my biggest issue with the CEO is that the work culture changed a lot since the CEO started. 

The previous CEO was chilled af. Fair, reasonable and for example was someone who would catch up with anyone for a drink if he is available. 

New CEO is going down of I Don't Give A Fuck and it shows. Staff morale is down big times etc. Of course lack of money is used as an excuse most of the time but I want to ask a trick question, potentially used in historical events (regardless what country) or even better from a sub culture/movie. 

Something that goes deep and goes down the line of attacking the CEO for destroying an amazing workplace. 

Any idea would be appreciated",1646511613.0

I have been with the company for a little over 3 years now, and just recently I have been having some issues regarding underpayment of wages (this has never happened to me before, and they have always been on time with full pay before this). The underpayment was roughly equal to around half my usual paystub. My leave started on January 14th and ended on February 14th. 

We are paid semi-monthly, so the two payments from end of January and February 15th were both roughly half of my typical salary. 

I have gone through the normal routes of HR in an attempt to pay back wages owed to me, but after many ignored emails and contact attempts, they finally remedied the underpayment ~45 days later. 

The DPC (Disability Pay Continuance) plan I am enrolled in guarantees 100% of ‚Äúbase salary ‚Äú for up to 12 weeks. I had only used about 4 weeks, so should‚Äôve been receiving 100% of normal salary pay. 

To make matters a bit more complicated, I had received an 8% raise which would‚Äôve started on February 1st. The amount I had been given on March 1st assumed my base salary from when I began DPC, and did *not* include the additional amount that would account for the raise from Feb. 1st thru 15th. 

I had very politely pointed this out to HR (I understand mistakes happen; I just want what I am owed), and they argued that DPC only covers the salary you start with and does not change through the entire period of DPC, and that they would not give me that additional pay. 

Whether or not this is true, I am not sure‚Ä¶there is absolutely nothing stating in the DPC plan that states this is the case, and that DPC is calculated on a semi-monthly basis with the ‚ÄúBase Salary‚Äù. But that is a minor matter relative to the rest of the issue. 

Due to the lack of pay during that time, I‚Äôve had to pay late fees on credit cards, fees owed to my apartment complex (almost to the point of eviction), and was struggling to get by for almost 2 months because of this. 

After being paid the correct amount on my March payslip, fully accounting for the missed wages, several days later I receive a call from HR that they had overpaid me, and are asking me to sign a form that says I need to deduct wages from my future paycheck until the amount is owed. 

The amount they are claiming was overpaid ends up being EXACTLY the amount they owed me from my underpayment during DCP. That would turn out to be around a full pay period which they claim I owe back (one semi-monthly payslip). 

To add insult to injury, they have been using veiled threats about ‚Äúmy future relationship with the company‚Äù, and that if I didn‚Äôt sign, it would ‚Äúseriously sour our relationship with you as a team member‚Äù. They also briefly mentioned they would not be afraid to bring in the legal department. All I had said was that I wanted some time to review the form to make sure the calculations were correct, but instead they used fear tactics to try and make me sign the form immediately. 

I ignored their ‚Äúthreats ‚Äú and have not signed anything yet. 

I am wondering if there is any legal recourse I can take here? Should I just sign the document and take the hit of lost wages to make things easy? Would I even have any case at all from a legal perspective?

I have quite a bit of evidence detailing email correspondence, along with payslips and bank statements, if that matters.

t7c87r,I am about to be fired...,,9,0.91,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7c87r/i_am_about_to_be_fired/,1,"It all started with a previous company that I started with in April 2021. I did the zoom interview for the position from inside the hospital, in which I had informed them I had been there for the last 2 weeks. They were aware of my medical issues but stated it shouldn't be a problem because I would be working remotely. Even after I started, I verified with my manager that even if the company went back to in person in September I would be allowed to stay remote. She informed me that me and another guy on my team who was dying would probably be allowed to stay remote. During that same meeting though, she told me people at that company were super petty and that I would need to watch my attitude and how I interact because they could make my life miserable. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt  make a problem. But I thought this was a weird thing to tell me.

But then in July her attitude changed. She started to become upset with me because I met with another department head to review a propensity model proposal she had asked me to write. It was related to the credit card department, he was over that department. He reached out and I met with him over Microsoft teams to answer his questions. She took that as me not respecting her or something along those lines. I cannot remember what she said. All of a sudden, she starts emailing me every request to maintain a paper trail and starts telling me that the 14 page propensity model proposal that I wrote up for her was too difficult to understand and that only a data scientist could understand it. In essence she asked me to dumb it down. I advised her she told me that it was supposed to go to the modeling department and that they would be able to understand it since they needed to approve it if I were to start actually building the model. That upset her more. At that point, she told me that my working remote was at her discretion and that I had to show up to the office immediately. I had literally been admitted to the hospital again and at this point had been there for 10 days and she knew that. That was the final straw that made me decide to go on medical leave (among other more serious things) and then disappeared until October. I felt bad as I was going to be leaving them hanging on that project but I didn't care anymore. I was told that I would not qualify to be paid for any of it even though the handbook said I would be paid so the last time I was paid was in July of 2021. I thought this was also not right. But I didn‚Äôt want to argue with them. This company is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked at even though it was a financial institution. I knew I could never win against an argument with them.

Fast forward to the end of September. They're now threatening to fire me because I have been on medical leave for too long they say. I advise them I will be happy to return if they approve my ability to work remote. They begrudgingly agree. The HR lady was being mean and hateful during the process of getting the medical paperwork completed where my doctor advised them I had to be remote and at some point she calls my doctor and requests for my actual medical information. The doctor apparently goes off on her and tells her I would be able to sue and that she knows better than that. I was unaware of anything going on between my doctor and HR as the HR lady was ghosting me up until this point. All of a sudden, I receive a call from the HR lady and she's so friendly. She's trying to explain her side. I have no idea what is going on and I just advise her that I believe my doctor's have sent the paperwork to her. She says my request is approved and I thank her. Shortly after, the doctor's office calls and advises me on the conversation they just had with her and tells me that what she did was wrong but I tell them don't worry about taking any action because she approved my remote work request and I will return to work on Friday. I return to work Friday morning. By Friday afternoon there was an investigation started. HR was back to straight ghosting me when I was trying to find out what was going on. By Wednesday or Thursday of the following week, I was let go because I ""ghosted"" my previous employer instead of handing in a resignation letter. I have no idea what to do so I start cleaning the house. I see a random white envelope that I kept seeing being delivered and I decide to open it. It's the checks I was being sent weekly for medical leave. I promptly deposit them. A few days later, every check is returned due to a stop payment being placed on them. Yes, I ended up calling them and after arguing that it was my money they were going to reissue the checks. I have yet to receive them though. 

I finally find another job and start on the 31st of December. Stupidly, I add someone from that old job onto my LinkedIn. Within a few weeks of starting the new job, I get a call from an investigator at the new job. The old job has called them and reported me. I have no idea why because I didn't do anything wrong. He is yelling at me and I keep saying to him I'm trying to be honest with him. I remember him saying ""you don't have to try to be honest if you just are"". I know at that moment I am not going to remain employed there. He isn't listening to me as I try to tell him that I have short term memory. I take morphine, oxycodone, and dronabinol (synthetic marijuana) among a million other medications. Those medications alone cause me to have bad memory. The biggest reason why I went on medical leave was because I was in a meeting after taking my medication and I couldn't tell whether I was even speaking English and by the end of the one hour meeting for a work request, I couldn't even tell anyone what I was supposed to do. I knew at that point I really needed to go on medical leave. I tried to tell him if he could give me some time I can get my thoughts together so I can actually answer all of his questions. He did not care though. Well now I have had no work at my new job for weeks, I haven't been paid here either and I just know they're going to let me go as well. This sucks because I was evicted from my home back in December and had to live in my car. My car was repossessed by the bank recently when I left it parked somewhere so someone could pick me up so I could take a shower at their home. I have no health insurance and cannot afford my medication. I am in pain now writing this because I cannot afford to pick up my medication (dronabinol alone costs like $900). I cannot purchase medical supplies because the company can see that my insurance isn't active so I cannot afford the medical supplies to pack my open wounds. 

It's been a couple weeks of me trying to type this up so if the investigator wants to speak to me again, I now have my thoughts straight. I doubt he will though, he said I only had that chance. I just wanted to rant. That company has been ruining my life for almost a year. If anyone from there is reading this, I just want to say congratulations, y'all won.",1646495370.0

We would not have the revolutionary impulse arrested in mid-career, to exhaust itself in half measures, which would content no one, and while producing a tremendous confusion in society, and stopping its customary activities, would have no vital power ‚Äî would merely spread general discontent and inevitably prepare the way for the triumph of reaction.

>There are, in fact, in a modern State established relations which it is practically impossible to modify if one attacks them only in detail. There are wheels within wheels in our economic organization ‚Äî the machinery is so complex and interdependent that no one part can be modified without disturbing the whole. This becomes clear as soon as an attempt is made to expropriate anything.

Just before leaving for the day he calls me in to the office.
In there he says that since I'm just sitting there doing nothing I am risking that they would fire me.

So what do I do? I explain calmly that I were strategizing when he walked past and quite simply made plans before starting to move around the rings. And ended my explaining that if he had more complains to make, be sure to do it now because if he complained again I would leave immediately at the spot.

When I talked to my manager all she said was she couldn't afford to be short during spring break(it's not even spring break yet here), to get my shift covered and call her to let her know who's coming in for me. Then she hung up on me.  We had 2 extra servers scheduled just in case people call in, so me calling in does not leave them short staffed at all unless 2 others called in as well. And most of the employees were already scheduled, so nobody was able to come in to fill  in for me. Since I called in and couldn't go in I didn't. 

Then this morning I show up to work and a different manager asked me why I didn't show up to work last night.  I told him I called in due to a family emergency. Turns out the manager I called in with told him that I was to get my shift covered or else I'd have to come in despite my family emergency,  when at no point did she say I was required to still come in regardless. All I was told was to try to get someone to come in for my spot and let her know who it'd be. While smiling and obviously trying not to laugh in my face he said that having a family emergency is not an excuse to miss work and told me to leave and I could come back tomorrow to speak with the other manager. Every restaurant I've worked at has asked me to try to get shifts covered when I've had to call in so it's normal for her to ask that of me in my experience. But I've never had one actually say a family emergency isn't an excuse to not come in. 

I don't plan on going back in to speak with her because I feel there's no point.

You work so your loved ones don't worry\\starve.

You grit your teeth, and pretend to be tough while worrying about every fucking little thing that can go wrong ruining it, yearning for a break, some moments of peace, etc.

Personally, I resonate with this so hard. Particularly an early line, ""I'm pretty sure I'm worthless, if I can't be of service"" - \*horrific\* life experiences have tied my self worth to performance (Hindered by the world at every step to this day!) and the value others give me, which is...obviously, extremely harmful. The middle hits hard too, with all the ""What if I can't perform?"" lines and vibes.

t7fmhw,Poor work conditions and salary as summer substitute nursing staff in elder care - Sweden,,3,0.81,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7fmhw/poor_work_conditions_and_salary_as_summer/,0,"Hi, Reddit. 
 I notice that most of the post come from within the USA so don‚Äôt know how relevant my post will be coming from Sweden. But I found inspiration within this subreddit to stand up more for myself and the poor working conditions of summer jobs and I feel the need to share my experience because sometimes I doubt if it is me who expect too much or that I am indeed working in poor conditions. Judge for yourself (also, excuse my english. I‚Äôm not a native):

So the thing is, I am currently looking for summer jobs and desperatly don‚Äôt want to go back to elder care (but I fear I might have to if I don‚Äôt get accepted anywhere else and get very anxious about it because I do NOT want to return to the same work place). I have no problem with the work itself, it is just that the elder care is extremely  understaffed in Sweden. 2 people care for around a minium of 12 people (depending on your given unit) which if given ‚Äùhealthy‚Äù residents don‚Äôt need that much attention. 

But the thing is (to explain) the elder care is crambed full in Sweden and only seriously sick people (some almost near dying) get in. Hence the workload is too much because these people often have many diffrent medicins and health conditions. 

It is so bad and underfounded with the elder care system that they hire people like ME - young adults with no prior relevant education (I was 19 and 20 years when I worked). I do not know how it works in other countries but the seasonal substitute nursing staff here have no prior education (except that of some obligatory course where they make a one powerpoint presentation with a final test aswell as two online test and courses). With this we expected to handle narcotic drugs aswell as mental illness, violent dementia, alzheimers, seeing death and hold responsability for the medicine intake and overall health of the residents. 

Normally, a substitute is paired with one ordinary staff to care for that unit but in some instances both have been substitutes and that can be scary when you are handling residents with special needs. For example, once it was me and another substitute and we were supposed to help an elderly with severe dementia. But he had a favorability with ordinary male staff and we were both female and substitutes. He was known to become violent at times and (excuse me for saying this) for his age was extremely strong and heavy so he could easily smash down both of us. He ended up hitting my coworker on the arm. 

Through the two summers I have been working I have been hit, walked in diarrhea, sweared at, handled residents COVID-19 (without being informed they have it before we stand infront of their door), followed the residents to the hospital only to be with them when they are told they have terminal cancer and will die within months. Experienced the loss of residents (luckily I have not directly witnessed it). Aswell as Willingly stayed with a resident at the emergency because I knew she had bad hearing and would feel very confused and scared waiting in the emergency for nine hours overtime. Still I never got any appreciation. 

I pushed a resident in a wheelchair all the way back to the elder care (not that far though 1-2 kilometers but it was a very hot day) because our taxi broke down. 

I voluntarily cleaned out, restocked and order the boxes out of our storage because the boxes of newly arrived diapers and other stuff started stacking up in the resident‚Äôs corridor and it did not look nice. 

Never got any appreciation from the boss for anything. The boss never seemed to have any clue on what went on within the units. One day I was sitting with a resident with alzheimers and I thought it was a good activity for her to try to draw because she had little control over her arm movements and could exercise them. Eitherway, boss came and complained to me that we had to do more. But I was already always on my feet, running between the residents hoping that there would be no accidents among the residents today. 

For this work I recieved 21000 SEKa month. Including overtime and what‚Äôs called ‚ÄùOB-till√§gg‚Äù which is compenstation for inconvenient work hours this went up to about 24000 SEK (aprox. 2448$ a month or 2230‚Ç¨). Pay in mind that I pay 32% tax on this. Personally I think it is very unfair since there are way easier summer jobs that give the same or more. 

Lastly, I feel sorry for the elderly residents. They are effected by this aswell. 

Thank you if you read this far.",1646504954.0

My team consists of me (30) and 4 others who age range 34-71. Two day shifters, two night shifters and one swing.

Tonight, the 71yr is out on extended leave due to a recent injury (thursday) and another member  is taking a day off for bereavement, unfortunately.

I have one member currently working day shift 12 hrs, so that leaves me and one other, who has an adult birthday party she wanted to attend to.

I wouldn‚Äôt have had the actual push to do this without the posts, encouraging words or red flags of hostile conditions. 

But as of today I resigned from my disgusting inhumane job, turned the letter in to my boss and returned the keys for the office building. I now feel compelled to share my story.

Things that I rather would not share, but feel the need to share. The bullying I experienced does not necessarily cause infringement of any laws because the business is small~ 17 people and if there are laws they are not applied. 

I have experienced discrimination against having a chronic illness (type 1 ‚Äújuvenile‚Äù diabetes). I am told I am burdening the system by needing frequent breaks to use the bathroom, drink water, have a snack etc. Everytime I have had to step away I‚Äôve been asked why I don‚Äôt seek better therapeutic alternatives (cgm, pump, etc) but due to low wages and high copays, I‚Äôm not in a position where I can. And even if I was, it does not stop the problem entirely. I experience a low 2-3 times a month (non workplace or life threatening) and a high bg number every 2 months at most. None of of cost or lower performance other than going to the bubbler or sink for water. I may make a small typo when low when unable to move from my desk to correct it. 

I‚Äôm denied doctors appointments unless it is ok per the boss which means appoints are either before or after work. , My doctors are top notch but not available after 5pm or 8am? and a few Saturdays. Except for emergencies or when I need to speak to a doctor. If I have to leave I am expected to make up the hours as I do not have pto until after my first year.

I qualify for fmla, but work does not offer it. 

In addition, I along with others are berated at least twice a day for minuet things that often have nothing to do with work. Such as family and personal life, slurs about how their children are taken care of, life choices, the list goes on and on. I could write a series of novels for all of the things I have witnessed as well as experienced. 

1. I was yelled at for not putting a lab in the correct place. I was not trained for the position and just starting at the time.

2. I am often in trouble and disciplined for actions I did not execute. I am simply tattled on by a coworker to my boss or my boss tattles to a doctor. I can plea my case all I want but no hr= no assistance, despite clear, concessive documentation. 

3.  Told by employees that it was big of the boss to hire someone with diabetes because they know how much it can disrupt work. The boss has a connection with a type one diabetic. (I decline to not go further as I do not want to reveal myself). 

4. My colleagues have fixed hours. I am told to stay until all work is done for the day. This can mean 5, but I have stayed at work as late as 7:30. If overtime peaks too high, I have to rush to get out in a clear time. I have one 30 minute paid lunch, no breaks. 

5. Holidays are ‚Äúpaid‚Äù but not. Employees are required to work four 10 hour shifts to  obtain holiday pay. If we call out the week of a holiday, we are not paid. If there is a snowstorm, hurricane, tornado etc and a direct threat is posed we are unpaid for the day as well.

6. No employee handbook or policies. 


7. It‚Äôs taken a downturn, stress is high and I am now starting to experience ptsd symptoms because I stayed there thinking it would turn better. I experience night terrors to the point I wake up crying or screaming about something happening relating to the workplace. I also experience stress symptoms such as high blood pressure and heart palpitations. I have no underlying or preexisting conditions relating to cardiac. I have been admitted to the er several times with no findings other than stress. 

8. Also because benefits such as paid insurance, paid lunch and the positions themselves are held over employees heads. It gets to the point where I was bullied into not speaking to family about anything going on as it is a ‚Äúhipaa‚Äù violation and I could be fired. But if it‚Äôs personal, and not involving a patient it is not hippa. I am seeing my pcp Tuesday and am resigning because I cannot take this anymore. 

9. I was accused of violating hippa three times. I have no evidence and several witnesses. 

10. There is a core group of people who carry out the bullying. They all have worked here 10-15+ years, the actions are neglected of those people. 

I really need support, can anyone provide me with some links or support groups, even a suggestion. I am seeing my pcp on Tuesday to receive suggestions on therapy, or what I can do for income and healthcare support. :)",1646493500.0

After clarifying that yes, in fact, you can, if you change who you're responding as.
""I'm not ACTUALLY going, so it would feel weird.""

Me: can I move my desk space closer to the door customers use so I can see them, rather than jump up every time the door chimes? (others in the company have REFUSED to do exactly this, while I am saying I would prefer it for me personally, and they are asking me to be a primary support in customer service).
her: ""If we put a desk out there, then it will need to staffed ALL THE TIME."" 
No explanation why. WHY does a desk need to be staffed ""all the time""? Why is that better than no desk? Why is that better than an empty room, and me running in from elsewhere? Why is this different than the other times you've tried to staff the room?

However, now my expectations have skyrocketed. Every one of my supervisors is now grooming me for a promotion, which I straight up **do not want**. If I mention this, everyone is shocked. ""Why wouldn't you want to be promoted?!"" My answer is always the same. I absolutely hate interviews. I hate spending weeks anxiously memorizing scripted answers  to researched questions asked by executives who have known myself and my work ethic for five years.

I know we aren‚Äôt there yet as a society overall.  This likely isn‚Äôt going to happen in my lifetime.  But the more we normalize it, the more we counter the lies that we have been fed and permeate the very core of some people‚Äôs beliefs, the closer we get to people rejecting what has been common place, but really isn‚Äôt for the benefit for our species.

t7h11w,My job is shafting me,,3,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7h11w/my_job_is_shafting_me/,4,"A year ago I asked my job if they could give me a regular schedule because working different hours every week was fucking with my mental health. They then started scheduling me ONLY on Sundays for 4 hours at a time, which at the time was understandable, my aforementioned mental health was a struggle the first year I worked there, and because of the irregular hours I missed a share of shifts. But for the last year and a half, I have missed one shift because my car broke down. About 5 months ago, I asked if I could finally get more regular shifts in the week, to which they said, yes! But because it was winter, they didn't have many hours to give me.

Which was completely bullshit. One of my shift managers ALWAYS managed to get me half a week of work when she was on (she was told to no longer give me shifts recently) and I showed up on time for each one. But the shift boss still refused to make it my regular schedule. I asked for 4 months straight, Hey I need more hours I can't live off this, when is that going to happen? Shift boss said ""soon, don't worry."" 

But then shift boss hires not one, not two, but THREE new fucking people in the last 4 months to take the shifts I've been fucking asking for for the last 5 months! It pisses me off so fucking much, because not only have I been asking, I get government benefits because I'm disabled, and my worker has been hounding them saying I need more hours to be able to fucking live, the job has fucking government insensitive to get me working at least 20 hours a week, I have been asking for more as an employee that the rest of the managers and staff have recognized as quite useful to have around (my job is lifting heavy things around the store and most of my co-workers are on the older and weaker side) but the fucking shift manager just won't give me more.

She said my hours would go up in February, and now that February has passed I'm still only scheduled once a fucking week, with the three new hires taking all the time I could have gotten. 

And the final kick in the teeth? The third new hire, who's job description is lifting heavy objects, safety checking equipment and being safety guard while heavy machinery is in use in store, and sorting the various carts we have in store to the proper locations, hasn't been able to do any of that. When he gets called for heavy lifting, he isn't strong enough to do it. When he's safety guard, he fucking leaves the area which forces someone else to have to do it, when he's asked to do the safety check lists, he doesn't do any inspecting he just checks the boxes and leaves. When he's doing what is literally the main part of the job sorting carts, he ALWAYS puts them in the wrong spots, blocking product that CAN'T be blocked, blocking seating, and over filling the aisles preventing customers from entering. I and my other coworkers have told him MULTIPLE TIMES HOW TO DO HIS JOB, and a month in he still does nothing right. 

I don't want to leave this job. It's easy, there's free food for employees, I get paid $18 an hour, but they just won't give me what I've been asking for. I NEED money. I NEED hours. 5 months into trying, and nothing to show for it but 3 new coworkers that I AM EXPECTED TO MONITOR as someone who's worked there almost 3 years. Pisses me off",1646509017.0

I work for an absolutely horrible supervisor. Mean. Untrusting. Unkind. Emotionally manipulative. People I've spoken to outside of work have described experiences with them as ""emotionally scarring"" and like ""emotional whiplash."" 

Paranoid (thinks coworkers are constantly out to undermine their ""power""). Weird (has asked me directly for ""loyalty"" to them). They're super stressed, and take it out on the people they supervise. They don't respect other people's time at all. I had a 1:1 scheduled, it got cancelled last minute. Rescheduled for the next day. Cancelled again. 

Friday shows up I'm sitting in the meeting and a half hour of staring at the screen, their *assistant* calls me to say hey your boss can't make it. That happens often, never even so much as a ""sorry about that ""

I'd wake up anxious af every morning. I'd dread going in. I tried talking to them about how i felt unsupported and needed more structure, and they'd get extremely defensive, say that's just the way it is, and place the blame on me. (Mind you the first time I asked for and received no additional support was only three weeks into the job...)

Finally decided it was time to quit. I talk about this a lot in therapy and after months of trying to manage up and do things outside of work to stay sane, even my therapist agreed it was time to straight up quit.

So I did. Sent in my letter of resignation on Sunday, saying I'd rather have done it in person but it didn't seem like we'd get a chance to speak anytime soon... No answer. Went half the week not even acknowledging it. 

Calls me out the blue on Wednesday and says ""get i only have a minute but your last day, can you give us a few more weeks? That's not really enough time to find someone.""

Lol. That was literally the first thing they said to me in acknowledgement. No, no I can't because the rain I'm leaving is literally that medical professionals agree you're bad for my physical and mental health.

I feel very lucky that I'm in a position I can do this. And this sub has inspired me. I've got a part time job lined up along with savings to pay the bills etc while i look for full-time work, and i already feel much less stress. Best decision I've made for myself lately.",1646488925.0

I have applied for numerous jobs over the years including but not limited to:

\- apartment concierge

\- musical instrument retail

\- assistant manager for a local symphony orchestra

\- ticketing for that same local symphony orchestra

\- drama department technician at a high school

\- musical instrument pedagogy

\- management for a chamber ensemble

\- admin work at an arts organization

\- vaping retail

\- waiting

\- pizza e-bike delivery

\- prison librarian

\- radio production

\- marketting

\- copywriting

And I have been rejected from every single one of them. My goal over the past 4-5 years has been to find a job that can afford me sufficient economic mobility to move out of my parents house and eventually move to another city. I was anticipating on moving to Australia or central Europe a few years ago but that was unfortunately foiled by COVID-19. The pandemic has also undoubtedly foiled my performance gigging opportunities.

The head of the music faculty at my uni last year expressed interest in having me as a research assistant but said that there were currently no vacancies to fill that role.

I have been on welfare since 18 and I spent my early 20s finishing an undergraduate degree in music while earning cash from performing gigs intermittently. Every job outside my field is so fucking hyper specialized. I need at least 4 years of customer experience to get a retail job, hospitality experience for a waiting job, 4 years working in any niche, administrative, managerial role. Very few jobs exist where I can walk into with minimal experience and be guaranteed livable income to pay rent, bills, groceries, transportation etc. 

Yet my boomer parents -  an early childhood teacher and a hospital orderly who have held down their positions for 15 and 20 years respectively are totally oblivious to job precarity. My mum seems particularly insistent that my lack of job prospects comes down to personal deficiencies on my part for not finding work and insists that I should ""ask"" for work in person, not being aware that everything regarding advertisement for vacancies happens online nowadays and getting work through word of mouths happens within social circles. She has become recurrently insistent over the years that I need to move out ASAP and that somehow will enable them to retire, despite both of them having no contingency financial plan should they be forced to cease working for health related reasons. Both of them are forced to work despite their seniority (dad is 71 and mum is 62) because superannuation pays fuck all for my dad and my mum isn't eligible for it until she turns 62. Both have no savings.

It doesn't help that I didn't get experience, although I did have a casual unpaid role listing online sales for a local musical instrument retailer when I was 19. It's worth noting that I had a performance teacher for the first 3 years of undergrad who insisted her students don't work a 'normal job' on top of practicing 4-5 hours a day and attending lessons, rehearsals, classes, workshops and concerts.  I also made friends with someone who was on the cusp of graduating at the time I started undergrad who advised that studying without working was preferable to balancing study and work.",1646462959.0

I was paid 90% the salary of a full time teacher. The wide variety of things I was teaching was wild and it got very stressful but I was making the best of it. I needed to put my car back on the road and my car insurance was $1200 a month (bad driving record but not terrible). Thanks Ontario. I even had to pick up serving shifts at Dennys. 

After months of doing this, I realized that I was working 65% of the day at my first school, and 50% of the day at my second school. So I was getting paid 90% to do 115% of the work. I mentioned it to both principals and they both expressed annoyance that they had to rearrange the schedule mid year.

I got a job offer that starts next Tuesday on the 8th and has training for 5 days a week 30hrs, $15hr training pay, but then goes down to $7hr as a server with projected average of $20-$30hr after the grand opening. 

And even if I get only the $20hr with those tips then I'd be making a good almost $8 more than what I currently make. 

I love where I currently work but the schedule never comes out before 1pm on Sunday with the first shift starting Monday morning. So it causes a lot of anxiety of not knowing when I work for so long. They also schedule 12hr shifts for me most of the time, so I was thinking it would be easy to put in a two week notice, but this job can't wait for me for 2 weeks. And I don't know how to put in a 2 week notice but still ask for either only night shifts (training would end at 3:30 and evening shifts at my current job start at 4.

So how would you message your boss in this situation? I really need the better pay, but idk how to quit/change my schedule so quickly without them getting mad at me.

I told my business agent what‚Äôs going on, he kept assuring me that he was going to force him to put me in permanently since I already had passed my probation. I called my business agent last week if he was able to work anything out. My business agent told me he was able to keep my seniority and pay rate of $30. I told him alright so when do I start, he said when the volume picks up. I told him there‚Äôs cover drivers with lower seniority and they are driving already. My business agent all of a sudden is on his side saying I only did 28  working days and that the days I took the class didn‚Äôt count. I told him I never was counting class days as working days, I was only counting working days I have pay stubs to prove it. My business agent said we can review this past Monday which didn‚Äôt. This guys is having me wait so long it‚Äôs already been 8month ago, I should have just taken other driving offers from HR instead of waiting so long. Also, I don‚Äôt understand if according to my business agent if all of sudden I didn‚Äôt pass my probation then why is he saying he was able to keep my seniority and the pay rate it doesn‚Äôt make sense. At this point my business agent is switching sides and doesn‚Äôt want to help. My coworker suggested to call the union leader to have him do his job because he is not helping one bit and if the union leader doesn‚Äôt put the business agent in his sport, he said to have the National Labor Relations Board involved. I texted the union leader for the teamsters on Thursday, he replied a few of my text messages then stopped responding after he told me he was having a meeting. Yesterday I called him and texted him the situation this his business agent that working for him is screwing me over and doesn‚Äôt want to help. I asked him if he can help me whatsoever as a fellow teamster.. he just left me on read. At this point idk what to do. If there is anyone that can help me I would great greatly appreciate it.

I worked 40 hours a week at $10 an hour while paying $1000 a month in rent. I have watched my bank account bleed money every month.


The restaurant I worked in promised me $13 an hour and I waited for months. I was promised a promotion, and I waited for months. The store got busier. The shifts‚Äô crews got smaller. A 7-man team became six, then five, then four, then three. I waited for months.


Finally, one of the three of us on a shift breaks. His anger over what would normally have been a tiny mistake leads to him threatening to assault me. I no longer can safely work there, he stays. I am now out of a job because he is the only one trained to work his position.


Nothing the lower-level supervisors can do about it. The GM claims he‚Äôs done everything he can. The thing is- I actually believe him. The GM doesn‚Äôt even have the power to run his store effectively because he needs permission from his boss, who needs permission from her boss, who needs permission from her boss, etc.


I, a lowly ex-cog-in-the-machine, can‚Äôt even plead my case to these people. Everyone directly above me is dealing with the same bullshit imposed by the people at the top, who don‚Äôt see us as anything but numbers.

I walk in and basically know their cocktail menu already, I know about the grapes of wine they sell and how to recommend them, same with their gins and pairing them with certain tonics etc. I'm the most experienced bartender to ever step foot behind their bar. 

During the conversation  with the owner where he fired me, he even said ""you're a great bartender, and I'd rather keep you on."" the issue is a clique of three people (the hostess/supervisor and two bartenders, it's a small place) but apparently I'm not ""gelling"" with anyone there. The problem isn't everyone, I get along with every non bartender, the bar back loves me, one bartender who doesn't have an ego and just likes learning my tricks and hearing my war stories loves me and we go out drinking sometimes. 

Multiple people have commented that the three who have complained to the owner, have been arseholes to me, and the bartender with no ego has commented that I was being given shit detail while the owner/manager was away, and jumped on the grenade and took shit jobs a couple times for me because he thought it was out of order. 

My theory; it's because the owner doesn't really believe in titles. I think people are gunning for head bartender and I'm a likelier option than them. But they dont know that one of the arseholes is the head bartender already. If they know it, the rest of us sure as shit don't.

My response was to point out that most of the staff like me, I'm helpful, friendly, hard working, I take as many hours as I can get, show up early when it gets busy if I'm asked to, told him that I've had comments about how I've been treated and asked him to make more enquiries. It was a casual kind of conversation for one that included me being fired, I said at one point that ""if you've had a clique form in your business that's going to try and muscle out anyone with more skill and experience than them, you can only go downhill from here."" Which seemed to strike a nerve in a way that works for me. I also pointed out several ways cocktails were being done noticeably wrong, stock not being rotated, bartenders making drinks differently from one another, the spec list (recipe book) isn't relevant because we now use different stock and the garnishes change due to availability, and we now have a dehydrator which has changed half of them. 

I then offered to work in a managerial capacity (I may have gotten too ballsy there, I know; I'd just been fired) and get things in line. I was given one weeks notice and he said he was going to make some more enquiries and we'll have another chat before the end of the week. 

Think I played it smart but this is bullshit.

Anyways, we started looking for a new boss and told the CEO what we were looking for. Someone with experience in creating new business branches, because we had a concept for a new business branch that was pretty lucrative. We were motivated to put the work in, if we had the right person (aka someone with expertise).

The CEO let us write the job announcement and had us invite people for interviews. Had them hand in assignments. One candidate looked particularly fitting. She had it all, everything we wanted. After interviewing the last candidate, my CEO who was there for the interviews told us that he had already decided on a different person. Somebody from a different department who he described as an expert on her field.

We were a bit shook, but I still had hopes left until I saw this person's CV. Finished their Bachelor in a not-business- or management-related field last year. Younger and less experienced than all of us. Only real job experience was 1 year in that other department and a gap year volunteering in South America.

This has got to be a joke, right? No. The CEO then went ahead and said we should just postpone our new business idea. Obviously, because our new boss doesn't have the expertise to do anything. I already wrote them a mail asking a simple question and they replied ""I will get back to you. I have to ask the CEO about this.""

But, there's an app where companies who just need short term work post shifts. Once you've completed a couple shifts on the app with any employer you are then able to cash out a few hours after your shift ended. 

Since these places do not have to worry about benefits, you can easily make $90-$120 a day. So, in my case, two shifts cover rent for the week. The third shift let's me put some back for my monthly cell phone bill and cover essentials. A fourth shift (if I wanted to take it) gives me a lot of fun money. 

So, I can choose to grind through a 7-day week and then take four days off. Then work three or four shifts and then take three or four days off. I will finally not be tied to a schedule. If I don't feel like working then I don't take the shift. No occurances, no points, no penalty.

Now granted, some of it isn't glamorous work or anything that will make you look cool. But, you get flexibility and (in my case) a lot more money than my previous traditionally scheduled job (which also didn't provide any benefits or pto).",1646494392.0

One example. ""The private equity firm Blackstone, the largest owner of commercial real estate in the world, is expanding its portfolio of rental housing and commercial real estate in the United States."" [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/business/blackstone-real-estate-acquisition.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/business/blackstone-real-estate-acquisition.html)

The only people who will own their homes in 2050 and beyond will be the few high income folks buying them today, who hang onto them for the next three decades as mortgage rates soar and rent inflation skyrockets. Homes will be passed to their children as key family assets. 

And God help the renters in 2050.",1646482191.0

Currently on vacation and not planning on returning to my job.. no call no show

Millennial here..sold the 40yrs of work & then retire dream when I was young. (SMH) I USED to be a person who had the decency to ‚Äú2 weeks‚Äù my employer and be courteous as I counted my last days. NOT ANYMORE. I‚Äôve been roped off from climbing the ranks multiple times and while being a great employee all I‚Äôve ever gotten was more work, mediocre pay and shittier situations.

I had a few questions I‚Äôd like some advice on.

1. I am salary, what happens to my 401k if I just leave? 
2. Will they mail my last few checks? ( I get paid weekly) 
3. How big of a deal is it not to give a notice at all?

Yet he refuses to raise her pay even though I‚Äôve explained to him time and time again that he could lose her if he didn‚Äôt.

I saw her cry last week after he yelled at her over something very stupid and decided to encourage her to leave and find a better job. I asked her to give me her resume and I looked for jobs that could fit her background and sent her links so she could apply. She had an interview today and they offered her a better pay, better benefits and her hours will be way better too. 

I know he‚Äôs going to be mad at me when he finds out but I hope he learns to treat his employees better and understands that being a boss doesn‚Äôt give you the right to be an ass. I can‚Äôt wait to see his face when she gives him her 30 day notice tomorrow.

To anyone out there who has an awful boss, never forget that you can easily find a new job if you really put your heart to it.

I reckon they realized my position could be just as easily filled through outsourcing, knocking yet another wage from $18/hr to $5/hr, all for the CEO‚Äôs bottom dollar. I know this happens with most major companies, but it was the first time I experienced it first hand.

(kinda long, about a harassing manager)",,4,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t7akya/so_heres_a_little_story_kinda_long_about_a/,1,"I used to work for a large corporation that sells location data and map data. They are owned by a group of auto manufacturers. I was a CSM for the local branch, working with another global auto manufacturer.

Now... this company probably has hundreds, if not thousands of products and services. On top of that, they go through tons of changes constantly, to a point where even if you ask a Director level person who owns what product, they usually have no clue....

Anyways, when I joined the company, my manager literally told me there's no onboarding or training. For a CSM, this is crucial, ESPECIALLY when you have such a huge product portfolio. She told me that I should ""read emails"" that go back and forth between everyone, and to join all meetings. I can then ask my co-workers if I have any questions.

Needless to say, it was a royal PITA to learn. Fine, I'll just work overtime. 16 hours a day isn't too bad, at least I get around 8 hours of sleep. On top of this however, my manager had a huge problem with communication. She often spoke extremely fast, and WOULD. NOT. STOP. to take a break between different ideas/requests/suggestions/questions etc.... And she would often ramble on for 10-30 minutes STRAIGHT. It was extremely difficult to understand her, because her train of thought jumped from one idea to another without sometimes even completing the prior idea, and then would jump back. Anyway, her lack of effective communication got me very stressed, and confused. Obviously I can't stop her every 10 seconds to write down everything, and because of this chaotic nature, I once missed a meeting that started at 10pm by 5 minutes. Guess what, she went on to harass me for being late, for 4 weeks. That's right, not 4 hours, or 4 days, I was still hearing her complain about it 4 weeks after it happened. Fine, since I made a mistake, and even though I apologized and made sure it never happened again, I decided to man up.

Then one day, probably from the stress I was getting from her, I got a really bad stomach ache, and severe diarrhea, and had to go to the bathroom multiple times in the morning, while preparing to go to work. Now just some background info., due to the Corona Virus situation, 90% of the company all work from home, 5 days a week. That's right, they don't EVER come into work. Now, on that fateful day, (which was raining btw), I was in a taxi going to the subway station, since I was late from going to the bathroom so much. On the way to the subway station, I can feel it coming back, and I ask the taxi driver to stop by a small mountain.

So there I am, getting soaked by the rain, taking a sh\*t out in the middle of god-knows-where. After I'm done, I head back to the road, call for another taxi, and start heading back home. I text my manager to tell her that I'm not feeling well, and I'd like to WFH today. Well she's not happy about that, and start going OFF on the text application. She \*again\* brings up the fact that I was 5 mins late to the meeting, and proceeds to harass me, until 4pm that day. lol. I literally laugh it off, since I'm too lost for words.

This goes on for 3 months, and then I find out she's leaving the company because she got an offer for a better opportunity. Now at this point in time, I'm literally doing a WHOLE TEAM's worth of work, since I need to get 30+ people from Europe, Asia, and the US to hold meetings due to a huge request form the customer. This request probably needs a whole team of people on it, but I'm doing it by myself, without any training, while getting harassed by this manager. I'm sick and tired of the work, and the harassment, as well as the lack of help I'm getting from some of the other members in the company. I find out from my doctor I have high blood pressure for the first time ever in my life, but still, I need the money right? Well... the B\*tch manager decides to give me one small ""farewell"" present, by telling me that the country director has also been telling her that I wasn't doing my job properly. And even though I could've waited 1 more week for her to leave, I said right there on the spot, ""you know what? If that's what you both think, I'll do you a favor and leave the company"". Leaving that company, even though it's the highest I've ever been paid in my life, has been the best thing I've done. I took a couple of months off just playing games, travelling, and enjoying life. Even better, some really good things have happened professionally, and I'm just ecstatic. And yeah, the salary was pretty high, around 90k USD in a country that averages 30k, with some crazy benefits (which I never got to see).

Money, although a necessity, really does not make you happy, especially in a toxic environment. Do what you really love in a supportive, respectful environment, even if it pays less, and you will SUCCEED. Success is NOT about money, and if you have to sell your soul to get paid more, trust me, your soul is worth saving more than anything else in the world. We only live once right? Think about it this way, if someone paid you 100 billion dollars, but you had to die in a week, would you do it? Hell no right? That means your life is worth more than a 100 billion dollars.

Long story. Bear with me here!

I work in warehousing/distribution for a certain Arkansas-based retail behemoth that shall remain nameless. On Monday we had a meeting in which our wage increases for the year were revealed. The General Manager of the facility was pleased to announce (to applause and back-patting) that we are to receive the largest raises he has ever seen the company give: $1.10/hr. for most positions (including mine) and $1.70/hr. for some support roles that had been passed over by previous raises. Okay, not bad! Certainly better than nothing. 7.5% inflation kinda negates that $1.10 but I digress...

However, the GM went on to say that the quarterly incentive program for hourly employees is being scrapped; a move he wholeheartedly agrees with because bad employees had been affecting how much of a bonus the rest of us received all along. 

The bonus system was dependent on each warehouse as a whole meeting certain criteria with a maximum payout of...wait for it....$1.10 for every hour worked in a given quarter IF all criteria were met. Of course, we never met all the criteria (employers gotsta do the carrot and stick thing, right?) but our distribution center consistently scored pretty high and had averaged payouts of maybe 80 cents per hour over the last couple years. It‚Äôs impossible to calculate since the bonuses varied but theoretically I‚Äôm still gaining 30 cents or so here, right? Nope. The bonus each individual received was tied to their attendance, on a scale from 125% of the quarterly payout for perfect attendance to nothing for very poor attendance. 

I usually got 125%. Not that I‚Äôm a perfect employee mind you, but I get paid reasonably well (for this area) and only have a three day work week. It‚Äôs three long, stressful days but it beats working five or more so it‚Äôs not that fucking hard to show up and put in a solid effort. 

Needless to say, a $1.10/hr. raise offset by the loss of approximately $1.00/hr. in bonuses, compounded by inflation at a 40 year high makes the company‚Äôs generosity a lot less heart-warming. The only people who are happy with this are the ones who didn‚Äôt show up consistently enough to get a bonus anyway. 

I have to admit that its a pretty epic coup on the the company‚Äôs part. Not that I was terribly surprised but it‚Äôs the principle of the thing; it‚Äôs the game-playing that bothers me. Dude stood up there with a smile and told us several times that this was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù. We helped pull them through the pandemic (which the company has profited handsomely from by the way) and kept this facilities head above water while other distribution centers in the system are still struggling with the increased workload, low employee retention and lax attendance. 

So I see this as not only an underhanded cost-saving measure but a political move as well. There has been a lot of corporate-mandated micromanaging the last couple years under their ‚ÄúOne Best Way‚Äù program (sounds benign, doesn‚Äôt it?). Constant procedural changes (to a job with an already insane amount of details), random audits, goalpost shifting and focusing on minutiae which, on top of the inherent chaos and stress of the job, has made for an oppressive work environment. What it boils down to is that in spite of ‚ÄúOne Best Way‚Äù, there is no right way. The job is one big gray area and involves a lot of judgement calls that someone else usually disagrees with. There is little consensus on how to do anything between managers, departments and shifts, let alone from one facility to another. It was only a matter of time until people had had enough of being micromanaged by bosses who don‚Äôt fully grasp what the job entails. (management who can‚Äôt walk the walk). In one fell swoop, the company managed to hamstring the possibility of dissent gaining traction by pandering to some of their worst employees.

We all know the score - capitalism ain‚Äôt about the individual‚Äôs wants and feelings. But it‚Äôs hard to take getting blatantly fucked for being a reliable employee. Any recourse here? Any thoughts or advice?",1646503475.0

t79y80,Starbucks Employment Marketing vs Reality,,4,0.83,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t79y80/starbucks_employment_marketing_vs_reality/,8,"Starbucks has successfully marketed its image as a place of employment that cares about its baristas for a long time. It has only recently come to light some of the mistreatment baristas endure through the persistence of fellow baristas fighting for our labor rights through either attempting to or successfully organizing unions. As someone who works there as a second job, and lives with someone who works there as a primary job, I want to bring to light the true Starbucks ‚ÄúEmployee‚Äù Experience. 

- The individual I live with applied for a full time barista job on the company website. When discussing hours per week in the initial interview, they asked for at minimum 30 a week. The interviewer explained that this would be possible in time; however due to training it might be a slow start up. With the presumption it would not be too long of a duration, the individual accepted. It has been a long time. They have only gotten 20-25 hours. 

- Since they do not get enough hours, and my current position provides me flexibility, I took on Starbucks as a second job to basically subsidize their ability to pay their bills and eat. I do this because we are in a relationship and I am not going to watch my partner financially struggle when I can help. 

- Transportation has always been an issue. The downpayment for a car is there. However, the manager frequently complains about transportation despite not giving this individual reliable hours to budget nor finance a car. Imagine financing  a car on 20-25 minimum wage hours a week? 

- ‚ÄúMinimum wage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt Starbucks pay more? One dollar over, which means nothing when no one other than SSV or SM are full time.

- New baristas often are put on unfavorable positions for the duration of their shift which could be anywhere from 4-8 hours without moving positions. These positions or tasks include ‚Äúwindow‚Äù where you are planted in one small area (not allowed to move from that bubble) with customers in one ear and drive through + co workers in another. Or, taking out trash, cleaning drains, cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the back line and more. 

- There have been plenty of problems of SSV, who are basically floor managers, enjoying their power way too much. Making fun of peoples appearances, harassing baristas about how long they‚Äôve been in unfavorable positions, and targeting what seems to be younger women or truly just girls aka high school or college girls (16-20). Some use intimidation and their authority for their own enjoyment to the extent you‚Äôre unsure if they‚Äôre getting off on it. 

I must conclude this by saying Starbucks cultures vary by location. However, I‚Äôve seen these as prevailing problems from many baristas who work at different locations and different shifts (morning, mid and evening). Do not let Starbucks marketing fool you. Honestly, I‚Äôve seen other fast food places treat their employees better simply by giving them enough hours, ability for overtime and mostly adult managers who are more concerned with work proficiency (which is annoying in its own right) than borderline sexually harassing young women / girls with their authoritarian intimidation games.

&gt;‚ÄùEveryone in this department makes the same amount because they‚Äôre basically doing the same things each day‚Äù 

This is not true, and the one other person who would be in the department was brand new to the industry and would require extensive training, according to what they had told me earlier.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe start this position at [$16k less than the salary I stated, and $4k less than the bottom of the range posted in the ad itself]. After 6 months you‚Äôre eligible for a bonus program and after a few years it‚Äôs possible you would be able to earn your desired salary. Then you‚Äôd be the ‚Äúhighest paid [position] in the state!‚Äù

First of all, that is bullshit and my required salary is well within the standard for someone with my experience and the type of role, and it was UNDER the range that was posted in the ad. 

I was then asked with a straight face how I felt about that, and when I thought I‚Äôd be able to start. The interviewer/owner seemed taken aback when I (politely) declined immediately and said it sounds like we are very far off on our vision for my place with the company. There was a few roundabout statements implying that in [state] this is the norm (it‚Äôs not). 

I said I appreciate the opportunity to participate In the interview, and that I would not have used so much of their valuable time today had I known that the salary range they posted and that I had clearly stated in my application was not close to what they were willing to offer.

What a waste of fuckin time. 

Employers - don‚Äôt post a salary range you‚Äôre not actually willing to pay for someone who is highly qualified. If the person states their requirements and they don‚Äôt work for you, don‚Äôt waste their time they could be interviewing with other interested employers and think they‚Äôll just smile and accept your insultingly low offer. 

Idk if this is the right sub, but I‚Äôm annoyed.

ETA: two days later I accepted a job at a better (more organized and slightly larger, but similar) company, and a base salary only $1k less than I stated for the other job, but with easily and immediately achievable commission that would double my base monthly pay the majority of months of the year, and significantly increase it the others.

In 2020 when covid first happened, what they gave us in lieu of hazard pay for being essential workers was an $100 gift card each month for the store, which they then would tax us out of one of our paychecks for, in addition to the money they were getting back with the gift cards and the tax write offs for them. They didn‚Äôt tell us we were being taxed the full amount of them out of our paycheck, I had to use a third party pay stub website to look at one of my paystubs for unrelated reasons, (the only options they had for receiving wages was either a company card or direct deposit, and I had direct deposit) printed it out and asked my manager about it before I found out. We also couldn‚Äôt refuse them because they would wait to hand them out to us until we were with a customer and make a big show of bestowing it upon us like some grand gesture, usually followed by the customer saying something like ‚Äúwow! You‚Äôre so lucky to work here!‚Äù So I would have to have $100 more taken from me every month after they cut my hours because of covid and I would have to thank them, inwardly seething with rage and tears in my eyes, or get in trouble. They were really shitty for a lot of reasons, (none of our heavy machinery/industrial slicers/fryers/ovens being up to code and really dangerous, combining job positions and making one person fill them, ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù people without pay raises and just adding to their workload, setting impossible deadlines for the amount of work one person was scheduled to do then getting in trouble for overtime, not taking action about any sexual harassment/assault from employees or customers including several of my own complaints, getting in trouble for bathroom breaks when I have a bladder disease, etc) but that was definitely the worst. Walking out mid-shift was one of the best decisions I ever made.
EDIT: There seems to be some confusion as to exactly how much I was being taxed for each gift card. I was being taxed $100 out of one of my paychecks each month for the gift card. Yes, my paycheck would be exactly $100 less with the deduction. I understand that, being a gift, taxes apply but they chose to tax us for the full amount as stated above in ADDITION to the gift card being spent in their own store and write offs. I don‚Äôt have an issue with them writing it off on their taxes. What I have an issue with is $100 being taken out of my hourly wages in return for a gift card for a store I didn‚Äôt shop at after they had their most profitable year in their whole 100 years of business.",1646447551.0

This happened in a company I worked at over a decade ago.

I was a technician working on large machines, we had numerous clients and were assigned to a given site. The site I worked on was across a border so I couldn't live near it, and had an hour commute each way every day. I got no expenses or mileage for this because it was my assigned site.

After working for this company for a while I got promoted to stop doing routine maintenance and work on more complex projects. Most of these projects were on a site near where I lived so that suited me just fine. However, the company told me they didn't have any budget to increase my wage, which is where the malicious compliance came in:

I combed through their rules and regs as well as my contract, and found that if you had to travel to a site that was not your assigned one, you got paid as if you had driven from your assigned site to whatever other one you were working on. My assigned site was classified as being 1.5 hours from the site that I was doing most of my work on, so I was allowed claim those 1.5 hours as hours worked on my timesheet. So every day I would put down 1.5 hours commute there, 1.5 hours commute home, and 8 hours regular work.

Anything over 8 hours worked a day was paid at OT rates, so for those 3 hours ""commute"" I was getting paid 4.5 hours. Because my contract said my assigned site was site A, and I was mostly working at site B, there was nothing they could do about it and my country has pretty decent employee protections so I'd have had to agree to a contract change, which I obviously was not going to. They told me numerous times they were going to change my assigned site but until the day I quit they were never able to.

The length of my commute most days was 10-15 mins each way.

TL;DR - I used the company rules to get paid an extra 4.5hours each day for driving for about 25 minutes.",1646433332.0

I do not see any other reason someone would stay in this job besides sheer desperation. Today's absurd conversation has been the last straw for me, so I will join Hayden in putting in my two weeks. Luckily, you haven't scheduled me for the next two weeks anyway. You hire workers, yet don't schedule them, and expect them to fight each other for hours. I have never seen management so incapable and unprofessional as this company. 



Secondly, this group chat is the worst possible form of communication that could possibly be used. Hundreds of messages are sent a day, and we are expected to find a small margin of them relevant to us by scrolling through an endless feed of profanities and incompetence. Within this exponential minority of relevant messages, managers communicate horribly by holding hours above their employees' heads like a starving tank of piranhas. These messages show zero leadership qualities and only highlight how unqualified our management is. More importantly, why in the world would we be so desperately understaffed that, as a court monitor, I am covering almost every court at once? If hours are so competitive, why don't we actually put people on the schedule? 
Similarly, the managers have to scroll through this group chat to see if anyone has called off work, which led to Hayden's issue. Employees shouldn't have to search through the awful W2W app to figure out what manager is on shift, search for their number, and call them on their cellphones because SkyZone doesn't have a sufficient phone line. 



Third of all, our incapable management has created a dangerous environment for children. Metal sheets are falling from the ceiling, ready to cripple a kid, carpet is torn up waiting for someone to trip over it, while the plastic trimming all around the walls (especially the performance wall) has fallen off and is often haphazardly duct-taped back on. Trampolines like SkySlam are falling apart, while management poorly tries to cover up the issue. I've seen children fall through the springs and have to climb out. 
I'm one of the youngest people in this group chat but have more maturity and education than half of you combined. I apologize to the other half who have to put up with them. I applied to this job because I thought it would be a fun environment, but it made me lose hope in our education system. Who do you people think you are? (*cough cough Jamal*) You can't take a single thing seriously, and that's why you're stuck in this dead-end job. 



As I'm writing this, I got the notification that I'm scheduled for a shift in less than five days. If a company requests an employee to show up to work, they must give two weeks' notice. So don't expect me to show up to a meeting with less than two days' notice and illegally punish me for not being able to attend. 
This place is a disaster, and this letter couldn't possibly breach the surface of it. So let me know when I can pick up my check and all the other checks I haven't received in the months I've worked here. Good luck using your usual incompetent comebacks; 99% of you don't know who I am and I don't leave grammatical errors to be picked apart.",1646465597.0

I share an office space with my coworker. When we get along, he's very talkative, to the point it's very distracting. He finds a lot of issues with my company's products, and since I'm well seasoned there, comes to me and expects me to drop what I'm doing to help him fact heck and investigate the issues. I don't mind helping him, but I have my own stuff going on.

When we don't get along, it usually has to do with him having a personal issue with me. He doesn't own up to his own mistakes and lashes out when called out. For example, I am in charge of a big platform at my company and needed him to provide certain assets for it. To be clear, we are NOT equally in charge of this, but he thinks he is. He gave me a lot of incorrect and inconsistent information. I vetoed the rest of his assets because I was fact checking and fixing too many mistakes. I went to our supervisor to explain why his assets weren't usable and finalized my files. My coworker then called a meeting with me saying everything he gave me should not have prevented me from doing my job correctly and it sounded like I was using him as a scapegoat for my own failure to finish the project in time. I retaliate with ""If X coworker gave me the wrong assets, I would not let them in my file. Same goes for you."" After FORTY MINUTES of back and forth, he finally revealed he was upset because I tattled on him. He only calmed down when I stroked his ego and said how much I still valued the work he does and that we'll plan the next one better together. After that, he acted like nothing was wrong and worked with me again like normal.

Last month, he left work early because our bosses were out of the building. We share a space together, so when he got in trouble for it, of course I knew about it. I didn't tattle on him, but I believe he eventually came to the conclusion I did because he's been stand-offish, short with me, and quiet all week.

This all came to head yesterday. When I came into our office space, he was hostile about the next release of the project I'm in charge of. He fought me acting like I had to be completely done by X date so he can add his assets. Normally, I don't let other people add them themselves, but he told me previously he thought it would be easier on me if he did it and we created a plan together. Well apparently, he remembers none of those conversations, and had issues with how I had my files broken up, implying I am incompetent, falling behind, and not ready for him He kept cutting me off, talking over me, and telling me what my job is. He didn't believe me when I reminded him of our previous agreement. He was so harsh with me that I was taken aback and shaking.

In front of other people, he was nice to me and told our supervisor how swimmingly the project was coming. But alone, he either ignored me, or shouted at me to get my attention on how he hates my file set up.

At one point he questioned my file suggesting it's not up to industry standard (we are NOT the same field) and that I really need to ""future"" proof for my replacement. Someone in my field would not have major issues with how the file was set up, I feel he was trying to make me nervous over my job security.

I'm not sure how to handle this. He's making me uncomfortable. I did let my supervisor know a brief version and plan to go over this next week. I am not okay with working with him on this project if he's going to be hostile and try to take the reigns. Once his assets are placed, he should really be uninvolved in the future.

If this is all because he thinks I'm a tattle tail, then that's ridiculous and says more about him than me. What if he actually does something serious and gets in trouble again? Is he going to work harder to get me to quit? I don't think he's trying to get me fired since he's acting like nothing is wrong in front of our supervisor. I think he's just trying to mess with me and make me uncomfortable...and he's winning. How do I make this bother me less? I don't want to give him the satisfaction.

I don't get paid enough for this drama bullshit. I just want to coexist, get my work done, and go home.",1646490335.0

Supposedly, the manager who hired me has received my resume and cover letter, we've spoken over the phone too, along with my soon-to-be direct in line managers. Everyone seems on board with things, it's more of a technical role than I'm used to (I'm trade based and now going into an office supporting field staff + other activities), I was told the pay would be good, everything is sweet.

Well I got an official letter of offer yesterday, completed all the necessary paperwork online and sent it off, then got super surprised at the larger than expected pay (no complaints, but it did send off alarm bells). I decided to look at the position description, got overwhelmed by the specifics of the task descriptions and such (which is normal for me, hence not looking at it beforehand), and then found out that the position requires a base licence (which I hold) and a university degree (which I am currently studying but only 1/4 through). 

Now my first thoughts are ""just pretend you didn't see it because no one brought it up before now and surely someone would have said something if it were an issue"". Is this something I should be doing? Are there any alternative thoughts on how I should proceed with this? Is this even an issue, or is my somewhat silly ADHD brain overthinking things again and I really need not worry about this? 

This is a company that I would love to continue working for and will potentially have the opportunity to continue working for when it comes closer to the end of the contract, so I obviously don't want to ruin it straight off the bat. I also have full intentions of throwing everything I have at this job, and I'm confident enough in my abilities with my trade knowledge that I think I'd be able to do the job well (if I ignore all the technical jargon in the position description lol).

Any advice?

She‚Äôs one of the city‚Äôs highest-paid employees

In the midst of a record-setting violent crime wave in the city of Minneapolis, the person in charge of the city‚Äôs 911 center admits she does not have the necessary qualifications to run one of the city‚Äôs most important public safety departments.¬†

Lynn Anderson was appointed as interim director of the Minneapolis Emergency Communications Center on Feb. 19, 2021.¬†

She took over during a critical period for the dispatch center. The pandemic, riots, and unrest resulted in significant staffing shortages that still plague the department today.¬†

Yet, despite being one of the highest-paid employees in the city, Anderson admitted last year that she does not have any experience in public safety.

‚ÄúI do not have the certifications, the training, the security clearances, the access to confidential information or the subject-matter expertise that will be needed in a permanent director,‚Äù she said to city council members during a budget hearing in October.

As a result, Anderson hired an assistant director to run the ‚Äúday-to-day‚Äù operations.¬†

The city declined to make Anderson available for an interview, despite repeated requests.

Heather Johnston, the interim city manager, said Anderson‚Äôs lack of experience in public safety isn‚Äôt an issue even though she is the only 911 director in the Twin Cities metro area without that background.

‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt brought on board to run a functional part of the organization,‚Äù said Johnston. ‚ÄúShe was brought on board to provide leadership.‚Äù

But Dan Roehler, the chief steward for the Hennepin County Association of Paramedics and EMTS, said it is valuable when the leader of an emergency communications center has experienced the job first-hand.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to have someone who has experience with the ground-level work and knows how to best represent their department from the dispatcher up to themselves,‚Äù he said.

Anderson‚Äôs appointment came with a six-figure base salary, according to her personnel file.¬†

Since 2017, Anderson has been appointed and re-appointed to several interim director positions, receiving significant salary bumps in each post.

‚ÄúAs you gain experience, you tend to make more money,‚Äù Johnston said.

Over the past several years, Anderson‚Äôs salary increased from just over $130,000 to nearly $150,000 as she moved from facility services to business information services to property services.¬†

Her salary in each of those roles appeared to be prorated because she only works 32 hours a week, according to the appointment letters obtained by 5 INVESTIGATES.

Anderson is currently making a prorated salary of $158,810 after receiving a nearly $10,000 raise to take over the 911 center last year.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs hefty,‚Äù former Minneapolis city council member Cam Gordon said about Anderson‚Äôs current salary.

While it appears Anderson has maintained a low profile at city hall, rarely making city council or other public appearances, she has worked in some of the biggest roles in government in Minnesota over the last 30 years.

She served as former Gov. Rudy Perpich‚Äôs chief of staff until 1991. In 2011, Gov. Mark Dayton appointed her as deputy commissioner of the state‚Äôs Office of Management and Budget.

That experience in government is why she‚Äôs been able to jump from department to department, according to current and former city officials.

‚ÄúIt may be that she‚Äôs a great utility player, and she comes off the bench and she can step in and she can manage the division like that,‚Äù Gordon said.

The city leaders who agreed to speak with 5 INVESTIGATES say Anderson‚Äôs repeated, interim director appointments are indicative of a broader issue at Minneapolis City Hall.

Seven of the 22 city departments, including Minneapolis Police, currently have interim leadership.

City council president Andrea Jenkins blames the Great Resignation, saying it‚Äôs been challenging to find qualified employees.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the reality of the world we live in right now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo we have to try to meet our needs the best way we can, given the realities of our staffing, given the realities of the significant pressures that have been put on 911.‚Äù

Johnston, the interim city coordinator, said the city relaunched a nationwide search for a permanent director of the Emergency Communications Center in January after previous efforts last summer weren‚Äôt successful.

Until a qualified candidate emerges, Anderson will continue to be involved in shaping the future of the department.

Johnston said Anderson regularly coordinates with other 911 dispatch centers and departments within the city. She was also instrumental in securing funding in this year‚Äôs budget for additional space for the 911 center.

‚ÄúShe has been really a tremendous advocate for the folks in 911,‚Äù Johnston said.

But Roehler, who is also a former dispatcher, says the longer an interim leader is in a position, the greater the concern over what long-term impacts will result from that tenure.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I would have the confidence in somebody being around tackling any long term goals or expansion of a department,‚Äù he said.",1646488691.0

Conversation went something like this:

HM: Hi it‚Äôs XYZ

Me: Hi XYZ

HM: I‚Äôm calling about the two positions you applied for, which are you interested in?

Me: I‚Äôm interested in both but if I need to rank them it‚Äôs this and then that.

HM: Ok, well are you sure about it? Bc we need someone who can come in and lead and teach others about this.

Me: Sure, I can grow into the position.

HM: No you can‚Äôt grow into it you gotta be able to lead and teach from day one. Unless you‚Äôve been studying on the side, this isn‚Äôt your current department.

Me: Ah ic, well if you put it that way then it‚Äôs not my time.

HM: Well, you could still interview for that positions.

Me: No thanks, I wouldn‚Äôt want to waste our time.
(Says some filler stuff to end the call like have a nice weekend, click.)

The call was around 4pm, then around midnight I‚Äôm playing games and see a notification pop up on my work phone.

I like my current position but am looking to grow and get promoted, maybe I don‚Äôt meet all the requirements for those jobs but the way things unfolded it felt odd.

I end up getting a doctor's note as well just to cover my ass even more so. I searched up our district policies and I can't find anything that would specifically be against taking off my shoes in the classroom.

I also want to have my students do so as well - I've seen some studies about how it can relax kids, but again, my VP was like, it's against the rules.i searched that up as well and I can't seem to find something specifically against it.

Can anyone provide some insight on Policy versus Professional Expectation?",1646510059.0
