sq1bi4,Stop fetishizing small businesses. They are the first gatekeeper in exploiting the working class,2342,0.84,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq1bi4/stop_fetishizing_small_businesses_they_are_the/,359,"Small businesses can rarely pay a living wage. And there are a lot of them. So many of them in fact, that their inability to pay living wages actually suppresses the average wages. Large corporations will (sometimes) pay more, but the floor is so low due to the economic non-viability of most small businesses that they don‚Äôt have to pay much more than a living wage. 

Small businesses are touted as a way to fight back against corporations, yet their continued existence lowers the value of labor as a whole in the market. If capitalists really believe in ‚Äúthe free hand of the market‚Äù they will agree that any small business that can‚Äôt afford to pay its workers a wage they need to survive SHOULD close. We need to stop giving our money and labor as charity to the petite bourgeois if we want this dynamic to change



Edit: for those failing to grasp my meaning, I‚Äôm not saying small business is THE enemy, I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre often bad ALSO. Alongside large corporations. You can hate both at the same time. It‚Äôs not black and white.

Growing up, homework was such a normalized thing for me, that I never really questioned giving it to my students. 

Even now, I think back on my high school years and can feel the echoes of the stress of staying up until 4 in the morning trying to complete assignments. I learned how to take naps after school so I could pull all-nighters the day before essays were due.

The more I read of the horror stories on this sub, the more I feel it resonate within myself. I‚Äôm sick (quite literally) and tired of the constant pressure I feel to work outside of my contracted hours. So why in the world am I doing the same things to my students?

As of today, I unofficially agreed to stop giving homework. I‚Äôm updating my policy officially on Monday. The only reservations I have is the fear that I won‚Äôt be able to teach the entire 6th grade math curriculum successfully without homework. Yet at the same time, I know that the curriculum I‚Äôm teaching is too ambitious for 180 days, and pieces of it aren‚Äôt even developmentally appropriate for kids their ages. The whole education system is messed up. Spend ten minutes of the Teachers subreddit and you‚Äôll know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.

My one rule for my career was I would never work on toilets, no matter how small or trivial the job was.

I recently left my job because I was asked (quite rudely) to fix a toilet. I declined multiple times because my job is to maintain the machines, it does not state in my contract I have to do facility work, plus I‚Äôm not a plumber and I have no idea what I‚Äôd be doing.

He told me that it would be a problem, I simply said if it was then I would pack my tools and leave there and then, he backed off and told me I would have a formal meeting about it. Turns out that formal meeting was a disciplinary. Just to clarify he had asked other engineers and they also declined, but didn‚Äôt receive this level of punishment.

I was told by my boss and other boss that I needed to ‚Äúrecalibrate my mindset‚Äù. So I did, I wrote my notice out that day and gave them a week. Yes short notice is unprofessional but the way they behaved and treated us I don‚Äôt believe they deserved better.

In the time they carried out this process they could‚Äôve called someone in to do they job they asked. Also I don‚Äôt believe that plumbers or cleaners are beneath me, they‚Äôre jobs are just as important as mine but I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to pick my tools up and do my job.

So yes, I left my job over a toilet, I don‚Äôt have a mortgage or kids so I can afford to take the risk for now. But the place was an unsafe shithole to begin with so I didn‚Äôt myself a favour.

sptbpr,"Company granted me access to their internal systems to do a 20 hour interview project, when they said I didn‚Äôt get the job, I saw them post in their system saying they‚Äôll run with my suggestions‚Ä¶",572,0.98,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sptbpr/company_granted_me_access_to_their_internal/,50,"I‚Äôll start off with, I was casually searching for a new job, I was in no rush. This seemed like a good opportunity and the CEO I was interviewing with made it seem like I was good to go but I just had to do a project as a formality. As FYI this is a 6-figure, C-Level position. It was $25/hour and a 20 hour project. Normally I‚Äôd say ‚Äòno way‚Äô but because I was casually searching I figured I might as well. To do the project I was granted full access to their systems (Google Analytics, their internal wiki, reporting updates etc.) all to my personal email, as well as access to their Slack. They wanted me to act like I was part of the team and talk to the team to get the work done, again heavily insinuating it‚Äôs because I would be on the team. Cut to, I get the project outline and it‚Äôs a full strategy project. Analyze their gaps, provide suggestions, and a detailed timeline to implement changes. I was shocked, but thought I was too deep to say no now, and he implied quite heavily the job was mine. 

I spoke to a few team members to direct me where I can get some info (I asked for a directory to know who to talk to but they don‚Äôt have one, so many red flags) and I conclude the extensive project. I don‚Äôt mean to toot my own horn, but it‚Äôs great and a clearly mapped out execution. I know what to do and figured I‚Äôd be doing it for them. They get back to me a week later saying the work I did was great but I didn‚Äôt get the job because I didn‚Äôt talk to enough people so it‚Äôs ‚Äòclear I must work in a silo‚Äô and that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre looking for since they all work remote and communication is important. Like, I‚Äôm working on a  20 hour project after hours with full access to reporting and data, you want me to chit chat and attend a Zoom happy hour?!

Anyway, that wasn‚Äôt the worst thing. Turns out they had no idea they had to turn off my access to their systems so I was constantly getting updates to my emails, including an update from the CEO saying there wasn‚Äôt a hire but he will be working on the strategy moving forward and has a plan prepped (ummmm oh really). 

I forwarded the update to him and said ‚Äòit seems I‚Äôm still getting updates, you can remove me from your systems‚Äô and his tune went very awkward quickly. ‚ÄòOh wow, okay yes didn‚Äôt know you had access, do you have any other examples, we will get right on this‚Äô etc. etc. 

I learned years ago not to do projects for companies, they have a 3 month probation period for a reason, especially  if they want custom plans. I also have examples of my work done at other companies so they should be bright enough to make the leap of faith. However, I was fooled by the ‚Äòthis is a formality, I love you‚Äô chatter, and figured a paid project must mean they‚Äôre invested. Except the paid project was just so that I couldn‚Äôt complain when they used my work and didn‚Äôt hire me since they ‚Äòpaid for my project and it was theirs‚Äô. $25/hour isn‚Äôt market value, I  would have charged $150+/hour (and likely done it for a 3 month retainer to execute) for this level of strategy. Lesson learned. I eventually went and unsubscribed from all their systems since they couldn‚Äôt seem to fix it.

UPDATE: I luckily didn‚Äôt put all my eggs in one basket. I received 2 offers from other companies on the day I got this rejection. And they were better opportunities that appreciated my work examples and offered a lot more money to get me onboard.",1644563693.0

I live in India which is a ""3rd world country"" according to Western Media. People in India always dream about moving to the US and working there because we have an idea that there is no possible better life. A few of my friends who have emigrated have told me how everyone outside thinks India is an absolute shithole and no one would ever want to come here. 

Looking at all the bullshit you guys are facing absolutely flips that narrative. I currently have infinitely better working conditions than the average American. 

For reference:

1. I'm paid $28K base per year with covered insurance and pension (after currency conversion). Now this doesn't seem much but my living expenses are so ridiculously low - $320 per month rent and another $30-$40 in utilities. The company provides a laptop and allows work from home. If I'm needed to come into the office (Which happens \~5 days a month) Uber cost $1.50 one way so around $15 for transportation for the month and I spend around $130 on food for the entire month. 
2. I get 15 days Paid leave, 12 days of sick leave (Need a doctors note for 3 or more days consecutive), and 6 national holidays + 4 individual specific religious holidays (This is because India has millions of religions so people need to take different days off)

Granted with my Salary I would struggle in most places in the US but for when I am located I live comfortably.

Also, healthcare can't even be compared. I go for checkups for various things (General, dental etc) every 3-6 months because it costs barely anything. I'm 25 and fairly healthy without any co-morbidities so my out of pocket health expenditures are minimal. My father is a Type 1 diabetic and his insulin costs \~$75 per month.

I'll have to serve my notice period, but I'm quitting following a post I read on here about leveling up and hopping jobs to level up salary. I've been where I'm at for a few years, had some excellent results for the company (¬£400k+ in saving each year) and they've done very well. Meanwhile, I was deducted a few hundred from my 2% annual bonus because the company hadn't done as well as they had hoped overseas.

My workload has exponentially increased, some people have left and I've consumed their workload without any reward as ""it's good experience"". I'm the only one that manages several key aspects of the company, again because of ""good experience"" and not for any kind of reward.

Following the job-hopping post here and after receiving the pathetic bonus I put my CV online. Had several agents immediately contact me and offer interviews. The job market certainly seems much brighter than when I last looked 5 years ago, might just be from additional experience.

I've just found out I secured the new job I wanted the most. 33% salary increase and shorter commute. Joining a small team at an established company that is really taking off.

spvcoj,Left half way through my 12hr shift,58,0.98,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spvcoj/left_half_way_through_my_12hr_shift/,14,"Started a new job on Monday. Twelve hour shifts for fourteen consecutive days then you get one week off.

We're given a one hour break and two fifteen minute breaks every shift.

I don't understand how this is compatible with anyone's fucking biology. It leaves a 12 hour off duty period each day. 

In that 12 hours you need to fit in at least an 8 hour sleep period. You also need around 30 minutes to an hour either side to take a shower, get dressed, walk to work, make a coffee and on the other side walk home, get changed, do laundry, have a shower etc - unavoidable activities directly associated with your work duties.

What if you accrue a sleep debt? People can't sleep a guaranteed 8 hours every night. There is no wiggle room over fourteen days to bank more sleep - leaving you sleeping in every day of your week off.

So once you've slept and put aside time to get ready it leaves you with 3 hours to relax, masturbate, talk to family, eat dinner, exercise, or just sit on the couch and contemplate how fucking shit this type of work is.

So I was working yesterday on a 9am - 9pm shift. Cleaning bedrooms in the morning/afternoon and washing dishes in the kitchen in the evening. When I finished the rooms at 5pm and knew I had to spent another fucking 4 hours in the kitchen washing dishes I just thought fuck it. And to think I'll need to put my body through another 9 days of this before the week off. Get fucked. 

We were also understaffed - the job is to take care of a workers village (people on the tools doing upgrades and works to a RAAF base here in Australia) - so it encompasses things like housekeeping, admin, kitchen work and general cleaning of the village facilities. We had 120 workers staying at the village and only four people spread across the kitchen, front office and houskeeping. Fucking insane - it is essentially balls to the wall all of the 12 hours of the day. Well I voted with my labour and said no to this kind of stuff.",1644571463.0

In Canada it's because we technically follow the US literally. We're willing to abolish day light savings time but won't make the move unless the US does. (Not looking forward to losing sleep this year).

But seriously what's holding us back from getting a living wage at 4 days 30 hours (NOT 40!!!) 
I know the answer is most likely. 
""Capitalism"" or ""baby boomers raised the way they are""
But reality is there are millennials who also believe there is nothing to do in life except work. 

I'm sick and tired of holding out for a miracle and convincing myself it's OK to want to play video games, my guitar and have other hobbies that really aren't feasible because I have a daughter and wife and 5 days a week are dedicated to cooking cleaning working and responsibility and day 6 is for errands, gas, shopping and extra chore work while day 7 is spent with my family.

sozuam,Hi. I'm an employment law attorney. I see plenty of illegal shit on this sub. I'd like y'all to know basic worker's rights. Let's start with a common one: Pay Secrecy. (With links to sources that you can print out for employers.),8971,0.99,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sozuam/hi_im_an_employment_law_attorney_i_see_plenty_of/,280,"First, a disclaimer: Yes, I am an attorney but I am not your attorney so NONE of this is legal advice. In fact, NOTHING I say on reddit will ever be legal advice. If you need an attorney please contact your state bar association for a referral. 

Pay Secrecy refers to the practice many employers use to prevent employees from talking about their wages. Employers cannot forbid employees from talking about their wages because this activity is [protected concerted activity](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/employees/concerted-activity) under the NLRA. Fun fact: Concerted Activity is the only right all employees have under the NLRA regardless of whether they are in a union. 

Any retaliation based on protected activity is also illegal and actionable. Retaliation is any adverse employment action such as a verbal warning, a written warning, a demotion, etc. 

You should always report illegal activity! ""If you don't use your rights, you lose them"" and this is especially true in employment law where there is usually a statute of limitations attached. 

Remember: report to federal agencies as well as state (ex: federal DOL and your state equivalent)

How to report illegal pay secrecy policies:

1. DOL - https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/complaints

2. NLRB - https://www.worker.gov/actions/nlrb-claim/ (This site gives an overview of how to file a complaint with the NLRB and links directly to their online form. It also has a lot of other useful information.)

Other Helpful Links:

1. DOL fact sheets - They have a few covering different subjects and all of them come in multiple languages. The one covering pay secrecy is second on [this list and is titled Pay Transparency](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/workers/fact-sheets). Print them off and hand them out or post them at work. 

2. NLRB website detailing Your Rights ([including Your Right to Discuss Wages](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights))

3. NLRB [Employee Rights Notice Poster Request](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-publications/publications/employee-rights-poster) - It details your rights as well as illegal conduct for your employer and your union. This also comes in many languages (28 to be exact). Another good one to print off to hand out or post. 

Once again, none of this is legal advice.

edit: This is all relevant information to workers (note: not just citizens) in the USA. I encourage people from other countries to post any relevant credible links to similar information. Solidarity!",1644474740.0

They can make you work 14 hour shifts with no increase in pay, add on days previously not agreed upon, break what seem like common sense limitations.

My husband works six days a week, is gone for 12 hours a day, and now they want one person working Saturdays for the entire 14 hour shift by themselves, instead of the manager just pulling some weight and taking a shift once or twice a month.

The first week went well, I worked about 37 hours and packed orders the whole time. 

As the weeks went by, orders dipped due to the holiday season being over, and my hours went with that too. I went from working nearly 40 hours a week to working 8-10 hours total a week. 

The job was in a warehouse on the property of the owner, which originally I thought was so cool. It was amazing to me that this guy was doing so well to afford to build this place, but the temperature in the warehouse was around 32-35¬∞F every day. Most days I could see my own breath while I worked and I could rarely feel my fingers. 

Any time I made a mistake, he would email me pretty nicely about it and say ‚Äúhey, would you mind sending this order again, the customer got the wrong item‚Äù which didn‚Äôt place blame on me, but it was clearly my fault. I would apologize and repack the order. But then I would go into work the next day and his wife would come in and berate me for wasting the company money. 

They would make me stamp the orders I sent with ‚ÄúPACKED BY (my name)‚Äù even though I was the only one packing orders‚Ä¶.. so I was always clearly my fault. 

Today she came in, didn‚Äôt even ask me how I was or anything and just started complaining to me about an order I messed up. Now‚Ä¶.. I mess up 1 order out of every 100. All the products they make come in the exact same packaging and I occasionally grab the wrong thing as a result. I even came in and labeled everything with my own materials to help myself make less mistakes. I tried so hard to limit my mistakes and I was never thanked for labeling things. 

So at the end of everything, I was working 2 hours a day for $15 an hour in freezing conditions to be berated by the owners wife for something I was already spoken to about. 

On the orders I messed up, I probably cost the company 3-5 dollars when they brought in several thousand a day. 

Also. Hot tip. If you ever buy a lot of products from a place and you think ‚Äúoh, hmmm shipping is free cause my order is over x amount, but priority shipping is only $11 more.‚Äù Don‚Äôt do it. If the package is over 1 pound, it HAS to go priority.",1644595015.0

I took the job because I needed something, ended up really liking it, but now I'm getting priced out of it. It's impossible to find housing that actually is only 1/3 my income, and my partner and I want to have a baby in the next couple years, and I just can't afford to stay somewhere paying me the same as I could make at the gas station down the road.

Because I was hired later in '21, I likely won't be getting an annual raise with everyone else. I wasn't really surprised by that, but my manager told me what a typical raise to expect is during the next raise period - it's less than a dollar, potentially just under half a dollar -  and my heart just fell. Because it's a non-profit that's pretty big, the higher-ups mandate what kind of raises our managers can give and I don't really think mine can do anything about the timing or amount of raise I get even if I tried to negotiate. I've talked to some other people with my same job and given the kind of pay they get it would be several years before I had a decent wage. (Our CEO, of course, makes nearly a mil every year. :) ) It's just really disheartening because I do NOT want to restart job hunting and like my job, but I can't live getting paid like I do for the work I do. I've pretty much come to the conclusion I need to leave both the job and the type of job I have if I want to not be paying 60% of my income as rent anywhere I live here. If I could I would apply for some better paid jobs at the same place since I like it generally, but we have a policy that you have to have been in your position for a year to do that.

To me, this just feels like micromanaging. We go around explaining to everyone what we‚Äôve been doing this week.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs YOUR job and not mine. If I need to ask you a question, I will email you or call you personally.

Unfortunately that means a lot of small businesses are taking advantage of the labor force to cut costs. In some cases having 50 to 250 employees can still be considered a small business.

It is the capitalist end game right, we end up with one resteraunt, one retailer, one of everything, anti monopoly laws do not work because no one can afford to compete. Amazon and Walmart may as well be the same company. You think Jeff Bezos even cares if Walmart took 5% of the market that week. You think the Walmart family even listens to the numbers any mora at all?

It is getting worse too. I am seeing Auto repair shops, car dealers, and body shops all being bought up by a single company. This means that company will be able to lower the cost of auto repair labor charges all around me, and suddenly no one wants to pay $150+ to have their car fixed when all the big o les scwab brake plus do it for less, so those great paying jobs I provide disappear.

The fix is simple, and we could all do it together. Stop shopping at any location that employees more people then would fit in the building. No more walmart, amazon, Mac donalds ect.

I think I've done a well enough job creating structure and processes for the position, won a few million dollars worth of work, and have been a good soldier to the company.

Lately however I have been completely checked out. After constant lambasting from owners and PMs, the feeling of exhaustion from unending bids to submit with no support, the inadequacies from coworkers which in turn requires me to do their job, I have mentally given up.

Before I went 100% off, I noticed the company was looking for a Sr. Estimator, to essentially go above me.. Feeling bitter and then some, I engaged my search for new employment.

I set up five interviews this week and have obtained some offers. I have not accepted these offers due to overall commute, sure the amount they offered is about 20% more than I make but I am unwilling to give up my 15 minute commute now to travel over an hour each way.

Instead, I continue to sit here at my desk, watch youtube, read the interwebs, and primarily slack off as much as I can.

Today I was asked by the GM and lead PM to create new tasks within this new ""teams"" app we are using.  Essentially, making every new ITB a task so it can be assigned to an estimator, then once award, it will be tracked to whoever PM it goes to, then to engineering and so on. I told them that this sounds like a great job for the Sr. Estimator when they hire one, he could use his managerial abilities to organize and manage this project and I can go back to simply estimating jobs and being yet another cog in the wheel.

One day it was so windy that the crane guy just went.

""- Nope! Union rules say its not safe to use the crane in these conditions.""

Now i was outside bending rebar. When i was done and carrying all these rebars back, there was a sudden gust of wind, on the roof of the house we were building (8 floors) there were some metal plates just lying there.

I heard some weird noise, and then a ""BANG!""

A sheet of metal like 3 feet times 6 feet just landed next to me, it passed right over my head, and buried itselt like 6 inces in to the ground.  I am very lucky to be alive.

Turns out those guys who worked on the roof, were just some junkies that the boss got in on the cheap. Becouse the boss didnt want to pay full price for proffesionals. 

Everybody else was union members.

When my foreman heard what happened, he took me too the office, and what happened next was the most impressive rant i ever saw. He started by calling the boss a ""asshole"" and a ""greedy sum'bitch"" telling him that from now on only union members was allowed on the site. (he was running shit now)

Then he turned around and said,,,

""- Oh! If i find one guy out there that is not in the union,,,,,""

Then he just buried an axe that he used to carry around in his keyboard on his desk, left it there, and walked out.

Now corporate is still corporate, so the boss got transferred instead of fired. But that was a pretty badass thing to witness as a 20 year-old.

spybdl,My Antiwork history,13,0.94,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spybdl/my_antiwork_history/,5,"Hello all,

As most of you, I‚Äôm a very vocal anti-corporate advocate with friends and family. This can be a bit awkward since I grew up in a country in which there‚Äôs a very strong culture of ‚Äújust being thankful you have a job‚Äù, which results in a lot of company ass-kissing by employees (which makes me sick). Anyway, something that my acquaintances have brought up from time to time is that it‚Äôs easy for me to be like that because I‚Äôm in computer science and have had great jobs, and great prospects for future employment (which is a fair observation). But I want to tell you today a story of one of my first jobs in high school.

I was 17 and working for a big chain of big retail stores. Working conditions were atrocious as per usual for such jobs, but there are two incidents that I remember often. Firstly, we were required to show up 5 minutes before our shifts started. This was unpaid time of course, and they often said showing up on time was showing up late (ü§Æ). The consequences for this, however, were unclear. You only got written up for a warning, and when I asked what that meant, I was told ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to have those on my record‚Äù and that was it.

Naturally, I consistently showed up at exactly the minute my shift started and got written up all the time with no consequences. That is, until one day the guard at the employee entrance denied me access. He said I had accumulated too many warnings and I couldn‚Äôt come in. I, of course got mad and asked him who said he could do that, and he just kept citing the warnings. So, I pulled out a piece of paper and wrote the events, signed it and asked him if he was willing to sign it, and he was!

I changed clothes at the mall, came back at opening time and asked a friend to give the letter to my boss and went home. My boss called me and asked me to come to my shift, that the guard had been reprimanded. I asked if I would be paid for a full shift, and he said they wouldn‚Äôt pay me at all because the system wouldn‚Äôt allow them to, since I didn‚Äôt clock in on time! So I told him I would see him the next day.

The second event is from the day I quit that job. The company had a weird policy that if you forgot your employee badge, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to work your shift. However, they would allow you RENT a temp badge for the price of half a day of work. If costed them nothing to let you borrow it, but they wanted us to learn our lesson. So, they say I forgot my badge was the day I quitted that job. I simply refused the humiliation of paying them for the privilege of being allowed to work my shift.

For context, I really needed that job, my family was not doing well back then and the money really helped, but I refused to be complicit in such exploitative practices. So, I guess I was antiwork before I even had the luxury to be :)",1644582516.0

Yesterday, I watched a public board meeting where teachers were crying and begging for a raise. As of this school year, there are 40 teacher vacancies throughout the district. As such, teachers are being forced to give up release time in order to cover for those vacancies....Because there are also no substitutes applying. This means that now more than ever, teachers are spending more personal time doing work stuff. All at the same pay rate, which mind you, hasn't seen an increase in over a decade. On top of this, the district's pressure to bring students back on track to meet standards is ever increasing. Teachers are getting burnt out and looking for employment elsewhere... 

Yet, the district is reluctant to make any changes. They pass motions to put bandaids on sores but refuse to attack the problem at the root. 

Here is an example: Substitute applications are being waived so more people are inclined to apply. At some point a sub could only work for a specific class for no more than 30 days per year. That was increased to 60, and now more recently to 120 days, making long-term positions more feasible. Being a long term sub (LTS) also means better pay. But there are no benefits to the job. Being a LTS means you have ALL the responsibility of a teacher -- preparing lessons, carrying out assessments, filing out paperwork, IEPs if necessary, intervention forms... and you get all the same pressures : why aren't your students up to standards, why haven't you submitted this, haven't done that? All without any support if you need it, because everyone is being stretched thin. Here's the kicker... you catch COVID at school and you have to miss work, guess what? You ain't at work means you ain't getting paid. But since you are a LTS, you need to leave sub plans for the 5-6 different teachers who will be coming in to cover your class while you are gone. What? 


This is a shit show. 

Idk what's going to happen to the education system in our area. It's all collapsing. And the fix is so simple...  Offer a livable wage and more people might decide that teaching is the career path for them. Teachers who have been in the school system for a decade might not be considering leaving. 

Better pay= less turnover = more stability in the classroom = better quality education for students.

Basically, I keep accurate records of everything the business does. From taxes, to new tenants and property owners, to daily financial records.

Two weeks ago, my boss took on 8 new properties. It was agreed that she would enter in the property information since she knew a lot about the properties. I would then enter in the tenant information as well as all of the funds we received from the transfer of the old property management company. 

I came into work the following Thursday, and she hadn't done any of the work she said she would do and was gone on vacation. We had to have everything entered before the start of the month, and she would be gone until then. So, I had to enter all of the information in which I did accurately. 

It turns out, these properties were supposed to be tied to a different bank account than our normal properties. She never told me this. Despite that fact, she still came down on me as if it was my fault. Changing over bank accounts in our system after they have been assigned is a HUGE hassle. I would have to do a full reconciliation in the system, yet she has always insisted we do our reconciliation separately because she thinks it's more accurate the way she does it. 

So yeah, she blamed me for something she should have done to begin with. When I told her entering in the information wasn't supposed to be my responsibility anyway, and she didn't include the information that would have made this change clear, she said I should have called her to find out. I've entered countless properties over the years and never had to talk to her previously because we never used a different bank account for anything else before this.

Over the past couple months, we've received several raises, along with the announcement of an employee appreciation month for Febuary. We've been lavished with free food, novelty company hats and scarves, coupon books, etc.

Today, middle management (dept managers, assistant dept managers, etc) received a notification that NG is launching ""union awareness"" training modules at the end of the month. I'm assuming this, the novelty gifts, and extremely late raises (we are only just now as of this week competitive in wages with other grocery stores in town) are attempts to stop more people from leaving due to the understaffing, poor scheduling, poor pay, immense workloads, dirty working conditions, and so on that plague the grocery industry, and our company specifically. Although we can see the module on our training website, it isn't accessible yet. I don't know if I can get a photo either, they have multiple cameras pointed directly at our training computers.

I live paycheck to paycheck at the moment, I can't fight for myself right now without risking my entire life, but the issues I've mentioned here are only just a few, and we've been asking HR to raise our wages and listen to our complaints for a literal two years now, all the way back to when You Know What started and we all became essential heroes. I can try to provide as much information as possible, but I'm posting here as vaguely as I can to protect myself, and also in the hopes someone can help raise the alarm and light the fire under Natural Grocer's feet.

We want our right to unionize protected, we want higher, fairer pay sooner, we want fair scheduling and comprehensive hands-on training, we want clean stores, we want our corporate to listen to us when we reach out to ask for help - they won't even approve tickets to have the holes in our store's walls repainted.

Stores have no dedicated janitorial positions or shifts, mask mandates are/were ignored, many stores are run down or dirty with holes in the walls, broken shelves, and cracked and uneven floors, multiple stores are so small product has to sit in carts in the backrooms/coolers because there aren't enough shelves, the employees are pressured to work 10 hr shifts and come in on days off by upper management, I could go on, but hopefully that paints a picture of how desperate so many of us feel.

Most of us are paycheck to paycheck, like I mentioned earlier. With the recent raises, and our yearly performance raises (a whole 20c), most of us who have worked here longer than a year have suddenly realized we cannot reasonably leave due to the HCOL in our area, and feel trapped.

Please help us. Please spread the word Natural Grocers is an anti-vaxx, anti-union hellhole peddling woo-woo pseudoscience and overworking its employees to death. There are 162 stores across America. Leave reviews on the ones closest to you, contact corporate (don't know if I can drop links but it's on the website homepage), call your local stores and complain to the managers. If whoever is sending those faxes can do it to any NG fax machines, send em, every single store has one in the back. I can say at the very least NG has always been very concerned about its public image, so any public comments/concerns not by employees will at the very least be seen.

I'll update as I can, IF I can, and answer any questions that don't identify me, but I have a family and need to be careful. Thank you.

My coworkers are lovely and my bosses (I thought) were pretty awesome.

A couple of stories I've heard from my coworkers has brought some terrible things to my attention. Firstly, the manager of the store sets up deliveries on all days that she doesn't work, so she doesn't have to do extra work. On the days that she sets up the deliveries to, my coworkers are forced to pick up the slack. In order to get through the morning tasks in time to put the deliveries away, they have to wake up at 6:30ish every morning (normal work time is from 8, to have the store open and accepting orders at 9) and sometimes even earlier, to arrive at the store at around 7-7:30. They are not paid overtime for this (they don't even declare the extra hours they work, for reasons I do not understand).

This Thursday, I was rostered to work from 5pm to 10pm (usually we get out at 10:30ish, due to our closing tasks, but we are compensated for that). At around 2-3pm that day, a coworker said she couldn't make it to a shift, so the store went about finding someone to cover/swap that shift with her. They could not find anyone. The worker who opened the store that morning volunteered to do the close with us, working at least 15 hours that day. I only found this out around halfway through my shift, as I was under the impression that she swapped with the other girl. When she was having her break, I asked her why she volunteered. She responded that she didn't want us to deal with one of the owners.

The owners of the store are absolute tight arses. Always trying to save a few cents. Whenever a shift can't be covered, they would rather literally work the shift themselves than fork out a few extra hourly dollars as incentive. Sadly, this is what they did to B. I listened with horror as she explained that she wasn't working for extra pay, she was working to prevent us from dealing with our tightarse bosses. They would make us stay until 11 maybe even 12 if it meant that the store was extra clean. Gee, it's almost as if working there for over a year has taught us a thing or 2 about efficiency, but no, everything has to be the way they want it to be.  
At my position (level 2), I get paid $13.73 AUD an hour, and my coworkers (level 3) each get paid around $25-26 AUD an hour.

I'm sorry if this post sort of sounded like a rant, I'm just so frustrated that my coworkers are basically killing themselves for bosses that don't even give a shit about them. I don't care about how much I make, I just want my coworkers to be compensated for the sacrifices they make.",1644568264.0

Edit: I don't want to post the video and its transcript because my contract includes a sort of confidentiality clause and I would have to take screenshots of our ""Wokrplace"" (facebook version for corporations).

Officially all CS employees (that is France, Germany, Spain, Lithuania, USA x2 , Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea) are having their contracts transferred to another company: Majorel.

We (Booking employees) have been working with them for some time and since about 1,5 year ago, regular employees job was mostly fixing what the outsourcing fucked up (not individuals fault, Booking denied them access to any of the internal resources).

The problem is, with the new company itself. The working conditions will be maintained for the first 6 months only. Afterwards they can do whatever they want with your contract and the only thing you can do is to resign which means: no severance pay, and (at least in my, French case) no unemployment benefits. Besides, many of my colleagues don't work at Booking by chance. The company used to have very high employment standards. The new company (Majorel) does not and they can assign you to work at CS of different companies each week. Today you work for DHL, tomorrow for Amazon. They can also tell you to move to a 'cheaper' country, cut your benefits and your salary by 70% to match the local minimum and that's it.

Some backstory. 

About a year ago. I switched jobs. The pay is the same but the current job is easier. And I decided that I won't try to hard. Because in this line of work there is no carrier path at all. Not that I believed in an honest carrier improvement from the very bottom. 

What happened.

The senior employees finally gathered enough evidence to organize my performance review. I knew that I will be forced to listen to some abusive asshole berating for every little problem I ever made and some didn't. 

So before the review I talked to HR, to my supervisor's boss. Figured what are my options and what they can use against me. Turns out it amounts to a month of mentoring with another guy from my department and idle threats of moving me to another department. 

The asshole supervisor used all the aces in his stack. Yelled at me in girly voice, insulted me by saying that I purposefully being lazy, waved his arms around like a seagull, exaggerated the problems I caused etc. etc. Well I had planed my defense. I will be ass passive and as apologetic as I can and when the supervisor starts bullshiting me I'm going to make allow me to bullshit more and more until he looks  ridiculous to the head of the department. Which let to this gem of the convo.

Sup.: What are you supposed to do in case of a problem X?

Me: I would do this and that. What would you do as a more experienced employee?

He was literally responding to the same question in the same manner using the same word for like 4 times in a row. When this part of the conversation was over. I felt so good. For a long time I suffered from anxiety and standing up for myself was always hard. But I managed to do it perfectly. 

The only real problem that the head of the department found out was that exactly one time I left 20 minutes earlier because the guy who I'm supposed to handover my shift came about and hour early.

It's a wonder it took me so long to realize. I don't know if it's worth sharing but here we go.

**Some people work really hard because they really suck at their job.**

In late 2020, I worked for a small non-profit para-governmental organization for a few months before quitting for a significantly better job. What immediately struck me when I joined was just how incredibly under pressure everybody was. They told me it was temporary and due to COVID, but I learned after a few months that it wasn't true, they were just always incredibly swamped because they took on too many projects given the size of the team. Being a non-profit, the pay was sub-par, especially given the workload we had.

Nonetheless, I was impressed. I joined to replace the senior research project manager who was supposed to coach me and show me the ropes before retiring, but she never had any time because she was constantly under an immense amount of pressure from the general manager to produce work, and failed to adequately delegate anything to me. Despite there being only 7 people under her, the general manager was completely unavailable, so months into the job, I was still only doing boring busywork despite being a tenured project manager and researcher. And somehow I still was under a lot of pressure.

I uncritically believed that the general manager was amazing on the basis that one of my colleagues told me she was, and on the basis that she was at the office at 6 AM, often left at 6-8 PM, and worked every Saturday and some Sundays. On many occasions during our weekly meetings, the facade broke and she nearly broke down into tears from the pressure. My thoughts were ""wow, she works so hard, she's great, shame we just don't have the financial resources to get it all done"".

In the months following my departure, everything fell apart, and I learned from ex-colleagues what I should have suspected all along - they had a horrendous turnover, and the whole thing was monstrously mismanaged. 5 of the 7 employees (including myself) left in 2021, crippling the organization. The general manager left, and then news articles came out about how mismanaged it was. *Despite all of her efforts and all of her hard work, she was absolutely incompetent*.

In retrospect, it was obvious. The new management is still struggling to fill the position I was hired to fill, but I'm hearing they're building back up and things are getting better. They offer a valuable service so I hope they make it.",1644590368.0

sq28ic,Mind/Body Segregation in Medicine: Great For Business,5,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq28ic/mindbody_segregation_in_medicine_great_for/,1,"Something I have been thinking about lately and talking about with others is about Western Medicine's (as well as other medicine's) emphasis that the body's functioning and the functioning of the mind are completely separate things. I see this as a rigged system that gives advantages to a ruling class who want you to work without any excuses. The culture in which we operate often see these things as separate and treat them as separate. The idea that if you are depressed and burnt out but if your body is not experiencing any symptoms then you are fit to be working. Even by the stories on here you see how pervasive this is. Hell, even if your body is not in good shape you are still expected to put on a smile and deliver wealth to your employers. 

The truth is, and science informs us of this with healthy confidence, that the functioning of your mind and body are extremely connected to one another. Not even connected to each other, but more accurately *are one another*. If you are depressed, this is going to impact your ability to function. 

Employers and the overall culture of a Protestant work ethic ignore this completely. Governments tend to ignore it a lot (although likely less so in Canada than in some other political regions). Some even say that engaging in the empty work of making employers richer is medicine for you, but you know that it makes things worse. 

Sadness and depression cause death. We know that it's worst and most measurable in regards to suicide, but suicide does not show the full scope of depression's deathmaking tendencies. Yes, depression is a leading cause of death (In Canada it's the 9th leading cause of death and in the USA it is the 12th). But this does not take into consideration that many deaths that come from heart disease and stroke are actually manifested by way of depression (not to mention motor vehicle accidents). Even various forms of cancer are highly tied to depression and living with the experience of being traumatized. These are all details that governments, employers and often ourselves seem to ignore and compartmentalize. I am convinced that the wealthy look at that compartmentalization as necessary for getting rich. The message is ""I don't care how you feel, get to work and do this tedious function in order for me to accumulate wealth"". To keep the actual causes of heart disease and stroke a mystery serves someone else's narrative. Anyone who has breathed in the direction of a post secondary class related to health knows that what I am saying is true as this is taught by way of demonstrated research. However we keep acting like these diseases are a mystery. 

Your depression is connected to experiences that you have as well as how you see yourself in context with the rest of society. Yes, it is a ""chemical imbalance"", but that imbalance comes from somewhere. It's not just imagined. If you are working in a job that treats you overtly or subtly like you are replaceable and that you deserve such treatment, this is likely to impact the way you see yourself. I can think of few sadder feelings than this, especially if this is in line with messages you've been given your whole life. 

And make no mistake, diagnostic tools reinforce this separation. One of the diagnostic criteria for many mental health disorders is whether or not it interferes with your ability to go work. For so many in our North American culture, their ability to work is tied to their identities of self worth. They've bought into this narrative that mind/body are separate and force themselves into roles that keep reinforcing beliefs that they deserve to be treated like garbage. Many diagnostic tools don't even ask about functioning in your family situation, but do ask about ability to go work. This reflects the priorities and those priorities are not for your benefit. 

I could go on about this, but I feel like I am dipping my toes into conspiracy territory and I don't want to get too paranoid about this. I will say that I think the suppression of alternative medicines such as the use of psychedelics either formally (in a clinical setting) or informally (recreationally/self-medicated) is tied to this. This specific class of medicine gives you the realization that things are bigger than what your limited functioning suggests. Accumulation of wealth by the upper classes is not possible when you realize that boundaries with your workplace are healthy and that gathering meaning from our efforts is a necessary part of staying healthy. These medicines help you realize that there is something bigger to us than serving someone else's greed. 

TL/DR: Employers benefit from ensuring there is a disconnect between your mental health and your physical health.",1644593952.0

Somewhere around the 60s and ever after especially with the internet culture and ideas sped up expenantially and mainstream society has not been able to keep up, hence why there's a mismatch between our understanding and the daily output we do in society.
The right to work, Henry Ford style factories etc was cutting edge during it's time, and that generation of people were content with having a job title and sitting behind a desk their whole life. Post WW2 and shit a lot of this made sense and was humane considering the alternatives but we have moved on A LOT . Fact is the entire work system in the advent of high speed internet and with a more highly educated middle class seems antiquated, we do not share the same values as our predecessors did because in every respect we occupy different zeitgeists. 

I've seen what work can do to people, the monotony, the low status, the repetitive grinding for survival that just barely allows you to go on without being homeless. I've seen the jaded, lifeless look in some workers and yo how can this be tolerated when it's economic slavery? Pulling this kinda game tricking people into thinking they are free while receiving a little allowance lol.. doesn't matter if your a lawyer too, work fucks people up IF they do not truly follow their heart. Remember that positive open minded spirit most had from childhood i to their middle 20s then at some point the realization dawn's on most.

Thankfully some realize it early and take counter measures to ensure a happy life but some get chewed up and spat out 4 life. Beware of the devil in a suit!

Digitalization, crypto, robotic work force and so on, we need to keep improving society for the sake of our children and theirs. Those before us who stood for sound causes didn't die in vain.
Work for some reason has gone under the radar because it is deemed positive but we cannot ignore we are working ourselves to death, the childish shaming being called lazy if you question it?

While I was at the store (a matter of minutes) my boss from the government job comes in. (Not to buy shoes, obviously). He said ""what are you doing here if you're sick?"" I told him I was only getting my paycheck so I could have some money in my pocket for food, gas, etc. Without hesitation, he asked for my work keys, credit cards, etc. He said ""this ain't gonna fly. You're done"". He went out of his way to come to my shoe store across town, just to see if I was there instead of at work.

Was he in the wrong or was I? Should I do something about this or forget about it? Am I not entitled to do as I please when I call in?

 I can't be the only person on the planet who calls in sick and feels better later in the day, or even calls in and isn't sick. What I do outside of work is my business. Also note, I was not getting paid leave for my absence. It was unpaid leave.

Like the rest of you with the recent increase in inflation and cost of living going up it‚Äôs gotten hard to get by. I‚Äôm a single male living on my own in my 30s and over the past year I got a job that was rather amazing. I started out at 60k a year and I was so stoked and happy I was cheering in my car when I was accepted and crying tears of joy because it was so surreal and I would no longer be paycheck to paycheck and finally sleep well at night knowing I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about bills and rent. Fast forward to today. My rent has gone up 50%, what I usually buy for groceries costs 60 dollars more and just everything is more expensive.

I decided to ask for a raise at my current place of work and was told I should have gotten a 3% yearly bonus (which I haven‚Äôt yet) and positive vibes that things will be ok. In reality that 3% doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference because even with that 60k I make a year I‚Äôm now going back paycheck to paycheck. Again.

Now for the part in question I was head hunted recently and they offered an interview and I‚Äôm wondering now if I should just flat out lie and currently say I‚Äôm making 68k to my potential future employer and see if they‚Äôll match or go higher then bring that back to my current work and say I was head hunted and this is how much they‚Äôre offering me to see if they‚Äôll pay more to keep me. I have been doing more work and adding more to my responsibilities at my current job to justify a raise to keep up. Would I be in the wrong for scheming for more money to survive?

How would you all handle this?

sq4edd,More reasons College Should Be Free (TLDR: College won‚Äôt raise wages for student employees because Pro Staff aren‚Äôt paid enough),3,0.8,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq4edd/more_reasons_college_should_be_free_tldr_college/,5,"Hi Antiwork, I‚Äôm a college student at a large public university in Colorado. I work as an Resident Advisor (RA), a student employee who receives a stipend (room and board covered) as payment for the community development and safety work we do. 

I was recently made aware that RAs have been attempting to unionize, what with the conditions we have been subjected to in the past few years. While the university managed to get a clue last April and paid its residence life staff a $500 hazard bonus for the entire COVID year (2020-2021 school year), it was made clear to us that this was one-off (and, if I do say so myself, a little bit of too little, too late). The new union is trying to recruit, and while running a program yesterday we were approached by two union reps handing out brochures. My direct supervisor was there with us, and after we took the brochures, he gave us the lowdown:

The demands put forward by the union include many versions of pay increases, but most importantly they demand a pay raise for second and third-year returning RAs. It‚Äôs not much, something like $300 per semester for returners, compared to the ~$8000 room and board stipend‚Äôs value, and considering the university‚Äôs recent struggle to attract new RAs, seems reasonable enough. However, they are almost guaranteed to be unable to reach any sort of deal. Why? Because if any extra bonus was added to the RAs‚Äô pay, *our pay would then threaten the pay rate of the degree-holding specially trained ‚Äúpro staff‚Äù*. These are people like my Hall Director (secondary supervisor) who have to deal with insane shit like people breaking their ankles cartwheeling through the hallway, and then understandably not wanting an ambulance, but having no other means of transportation to receive very necessary care; and who are specially trained to respond to mental health crises. 

All professional staff are paid hourly; the rate is something like 20/hr, which is already insultingly low. The RAs are paid 15/hr for any desk work, but if you do the math, we‚Äôre only allowed as students to work 20 hours per week: 8000 stipend per semester divided by 16 20-hour weeks is 25/hr. Ignoring the fact that we live where we work, which essentially invalidates the notion of a limited number of workable hours, we already make more proportionally than the pro staff. The only reason this works at all is because the pro staff are full-time and can clock 40+ hours per week plus overtime.

So yeah. No raises for underpaid campus workers, then we might have to raise the wage for our even MORE underpaid campus workers!

My supervisors are both very nice, passionate people (as you might expect from such a line of work) and have said that if we choose to unionize, they support it; but told us not to expect any of the union‚Äôs demands to be met. I asked why *they* don‚Äôt have a union then; neither of them have any idea. This is all so incredibly fucked.",1644599623.0

Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm in construction and my job sites are usually (45-1hr 30) away from my house. I‚Äôm usually there before any of my coworkers most days because I work at 7 A.M and I leave around 5:15-5:30 to go to work and wait in my car until 7, I do this mainly to beat traffic and to gradually start my day.

Yesterday however we were told to be there at 7:30 AM so I decided I‚Äôd leave my house at a time that would get me there around 7:20. 

I get there AT 7:30, grab my tools and go see my foreman. He tells me (insert supervisors name here) had just left at 7:25 and he has been waiting on me to show up and told him when yungquaalude shows up call me.

I get this information relayed to me and decided I would just call him myself. I then started getting a lecture about how ‚ÄúI was late and I need to leave earlier because that‚Äôs not acceptable.‚Äù I cut him off to tell him I wasn‚Äôt late I arrived at the specified time and the argument ensued for the next 20 min to the point I had tears in my eye from the level of rage I had reached. 

To sum up the phone call these were the key points made by him
1. 7:30 is the time you need to be on a ladder ready to do work.
2. Your tools are you‚Äôre responsibility and taking them out of your car needs to be done before the specified time
3. Somehow also sad that I don‚Äôt have equal rights (‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do what everyone else can‚Äù) 

I pointed out the facts of the matter being
1. I could leave my house to be 30 minutes early yet a couple of car crashes and I‚Äôll be an hour late and you can‚Äôt account for that
2. I‚Äôm not going to be here for free if you want me here before the specified time to get ready for work then you need to pay me for that time

Etc etc.

So not only does he expect me to be there before the specified time which I usually am but to also do work for free.

My boyfriend and I both worked there and we would generally work longer than normal for almost every shift (an hour or two extra). Not only because they were so short-staffed and desparate, but also so we could carpool home after. 

The day I quit, both of us had been asked to come in early, and had been asked to stay an hour or so later due to a surplus of people calling out. We didn't mind the extra time so we accepted. After working for nearly 11 hours with no break and no food, I felt like absolute shit. It was around 11:30pm and I remember that they scheduled me for 7am the following morning. I was pretty upset that they had called us in knowing they wouldn't be able to provide us with adequate breaks.

 I kindly went up to the shift manager, who had only been there a few weeks, and told her that I felt pretty sick and I wouldn't be coming into work the next morning, about 8 hours ahead of time.

Mind you this is a fast food restaurant, and the terms in my peperwork when I was hired stated that as long as I told them more than 3 hours ahead, I was able to call out.

She then told me that due to a supervisor change, it has been changed to three DAYS notice if you're sick. 

I paused for a moment, honestly dumbfounded, and asked, ""How would I know if I'm sick three days ahead of time?""

She shrugged off my question and proceeded to inform me that if I were to call out, I would recieve a written discipline notice. 

I politely said ok, and left. My boyfriend and I never went back or contacted again, fuck them!

I have been with company for 2.5 years and he has been present maybe 5 times (body, not mind) (nobody cares about your wife Jennifer) currently in Florida vacationing, told us all about how he works so hard, even when he is in Florida he works till noon.

I built up a significant amount of weekly revenue (~$35k) that I was receiving commissions on. 

I recently received a new job offer with a great company, and decided I was going to leave my current role. 

I knew that leaving would put them in a really tough spot, so I was willing to finish a 2 week notice, during which time I created training videos, training documents, and worked to get even more things done so they could get someone new up to speed. I even blocked their clients on LinkedIn, as they were worried that my leaving would hurt their future business. 

I just received my final paycheck, and they didn't include any commissions, only my base salary which is less than a third of what the paycheck should have been. 

What recourse can I take? This seems like a clearly unethical practice. The verbiage of my initial contract states that ""You must be an employee in good standing at the time any salary, bonus, or compensation is payable."" But if my being ""not in good standing"" would disqualify me from receiving payment, it would have applied to the salary as well.

So, I've been working in customer service from 3 years and it's my first company. Since WFH, a lot of changes have been taking place within the company and i wanted to know if this sounds normal everywhere.


 Cons:

1. Installation of security camera on our work computers for surveillance where we're not allowed to use phone, anything that looks like an electronic device and this thing monitors us for 9hrs straight.
2. Change of notice period from 30 to 60 and then to 90 days since lots of people started quitting all of a sudden.
3. Introduction of a security software that allows managers to view our Desktop screen at anytime.
4. Making wellness sessions mandatory.
5. Centralisation of incentive plans which ended up with employees losing out on their earning potential.
6. Menial paycheck hikes from 3 years.


Pros: 

1. Leave without pay benefits extending upto 2-3 months.
2. Introduction of career tracks for employees that feel stuck.
3. WFH allowances

If I'm changing companies, can this list of cons be expected everywhere?

The nature of the job involves a lot of driving. We will drive up to 2 hours away. I‚Äôve seen a lot of crazy accidents and lost count of how many deer I‚Äôve almost hit. During the heavy snow and ice we got in the Midwest last week they tried to make us work and still attempt the drive. We do not have direct management in our city we‚Äôre technically remote hires. That was the last straw for me. I stood up for myself and argued against the idea that upper management that doesn‚Äôt live in my area can decide if roads are safe to drive on. Made my point and we closed down for 3 days. 

I‚Äôm honestly ready to quit I already have backup plan. The audacity and principle of it is what annoys me. 

Back to why I‚Äôm asking for an accommodation: I have driving anxiety now. Within the first year I witnessed a horrific accident right in front of my eyes. An suv ran a red light and the truck next to me was turning left and tboned the suv and flipped it over. A kid was ejected from the car and was subsequently pinned under the suv. I can still hear the cries of anguish from the mother screaming ‚Äúmy babyyyyy!!!‚Äù I read later that night in the news the kid didn‚Äôt make it. 

Fast forward 6 months I‚Äôm driving home on the freeway at speed limit less than a mile from my exit (off the job) when someone rear ends me on the highway. Person must have been going 80 while I was going probably 65. I spin out and smack the median. For a brief second as my car lost control I was facing oncoming traffic and thought I was gonna die. Car was totaled. 

Fast forward another 6 months I witness another tbone right before my eyes. Almost hits my car too. My anxiety pretty bad now. I was given an accommodation before but it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted. What I requested for was no clients over 60 miles. Instead they gave me 4 unpaid days off a month to use at my discretion. Again it‚Äôs a decision made by someone else who didn‚Äôt so much as talk to me about it. I went to see a therapist to get that accommodation. 

This time around If im not given exactly what I want I will ask to be terminated on good terms due to the fact that im mentally/physically unable to perform my job anymore. If they don‚Äôt want to terminate me I will just decline the jobs respectfully. I want to be terminated so I can really take my time, get some unemployment, and get my mind right before going into my next job.

Anyway, the culture problem I‚Äôve encountered is when people are pushed for overtime there is an expectation of an explanation why you cannot work any given day in your off days, for example:

Manager: you in at all extra next week?

Employee: nah mate

Manager: oh right, got much on?

I wanted to go back to school for data science, couldn't afford to finish. 

Due to the gap this created in my resume no one will hire me. Mostly my old job doesn't exist anymore and for the most similar jobs there is always another candidate. I can't find a job at all in my field.

I tried signing up for government sponsored career counseling, no one will write me back and everything is remote so there is no office to go to.

I have been looking for jobs as a home cook and house cleaner, and no one will hire me. I don't have experience.

My service job for which the boss doesn't pay us the hours we clock in for, has seen a huge reduction in pay. I can't complain my hours were cut because he never paid us our hours in the first place.

Literally I am at wits end. I had Covid and didn't get paid for 2.25 weeks because I'm an hourly worker. I am at a point where I can t find a second job fast enough, can't pay rent for the end of the month, can't get a resume or job search assistance from the government. 

I am at a loss as to what to do anymore. And I used to be a really good worker when I worked in finance. I just need somehow to find someone to help me figure out how to transfer those skills.

If I could afford to finish college and get my new degree I could find a job.

I'm at a point of despair. I am beginning to think I should apply for section 8 anywhere in the State I live in so I can at least be housed, and go to the nearest college to get my second degree.

There is no financial aid if you need to get a second degree, yet what happens if you need to retrain because your job no longer exists?

What happens when you have 2 part time jobs and no health insurance, but live in an urban area where rents and wages are higher so you just miss the cutoff for subsidized health insurance.

I'm so fed up with this country - I would leave if I had any money with which to do so.

If anyone has genuine suggestions, that would be great. I am thinking about reaching out to my local assemblyman and telling them I can't get help with resume or career services. Maybe they can help.

Worse yet- I can see how you can easily work 60 hours across 2 jobs with no health insurance and barely scrape by on rent, let alone save anything. This is not the answer. I'd rather go on section 8, leave literally all my friends behind, and get a second degree in hopes of digging out of this mess.

One mistake of trying to further my career ruined it. My parents were poor and I didn't save enough in finance as I had to take care of them when they were terminally ill. If our country had better assistance for dementia patients - I wouldn't have even been in this situation.

ADDED: I just want to add. Being a risk manager is one thing, but the jobs are so specialized now, risk manager of mid-size fund derivatives, risk manager of card authorization operational risk. The problem is all jobs are now soooo specific? Has anyone figured out how to deal with that. To do something similar that is so close but not 100% the same?

I'm not sure why the hiring managers won't take a 90% match in responsibilities. Or I'm thinking maybe the market is flooded. I am beyond confused. Is it an Exodus of jobs out of the NYC Metro Area? Clueless at this point.",1644554400.0

I'm not at all a financial expert, but this makes sense to me I'm kinda hopinf this community will poke holes in the idea so I can shore it up.

**For large companies (I picked an arbitrary number of 100 or more employees for no real reason)** half the of income revenue should be parced out to the labor pool and the other half to salaried administration and ownership.**Not equally or arbitrarily of course it should be done based on how much each employee brings to the company and be estimated mathematically,** but **employee pay should be no less than 50% of the total average of what company income revenue is.**

**Walmart as an example has 2.2Million employees. half of their annual revenue is $2.795Billion.** If half of revenue were parced out equally among all the employees the **average pay would be around $127,000 per year so employee pay would be between $63,500 to $127,000 and if they used (or were forced to use ü§∑) that as a pay model** tax revenue goes up through employees and tax spending goes down also through employees, because of that whole thing about Walmart employees being the largest recipient of welfare in the US.

Please poke holes in this idea if your interested, it'll help me develop it more.

So I applied to a different team in a different department at the same company. I had no backup for my section, it was all me. Before I officially transferred I was called into a meeting with my direct manager and the department manager. They both told me how valuable I am. They asked me to reconsider and stay but didn't even offer me anything if I was to remain on the team. So I explained my grievances to them and said I was moving.

If this gets removed as well, oh well... but I think it's applicable to this sub because it speaks to shitty practices in corporate America and the stress they cause, and how the way these corporations are run brings about these situations (bonus targets).

Anyhow, someone posted about being passed over for a job because they are a white male. I have no idea if that really happened, no idea if happened as described, no idea if they were told one thing but the real reason is another. But, I do know this happens all the time.

It is illegal, at least according to the training I had to to do to become a supervisor at a bank.

My bosses have a target to hire a certain number of women and persons of color. The official line of HR is that we don't make hiring decisions based on skin color or gender, only merit... however, they can target specific locations or other similar things to try and attract a more diverse workforce (and if that was really what happened I would have no issue with this). 

But, because the target exists my bosses will frequently bring this up during hiring discussions. (Targets effect bonuses, rather than doing the hard work of having equal outreach to different hiring pools or opening branches in new areas... much easier to get your bonus by just telling us who to hire.) They will have a list with interview scores, race, and gender and challenge our hiring recommendations based on not having enough ""women or blacks."" (Their words.)

Every time this happens I object, but am ignored. I'm Jewish, and I always feel sick after these discussions thinking about how I would feel if someone said we should hire a Jew because we don't have enough Jews on the list. It's the same type of disrespect to minorities as the white savior complex.

Even worse, they aren't actually allowed to collect this data... so how do they determine what gender and race to assign? People's names. They put ""black"" next to ""black-sounding"" names, ""woman"" next to ""girl"" names, etc... (again, their words).

To me this is an example of how even a good goal, like diversity, can be turned into something gross by greedy bosses.",1644594071.0

WorkBoard is a dishonest, manipulative firm that is not to be trusted. They do not treat their candidates with respect and they're not worth your time.

Without going into too much detail, they rescinded an offer almost a week after the offer had been made and accepted. Compensation was negotiated, and I was assured that the job was a done deal on numerous occasions. Only after resigning my current job did they withdraw the offer, citing budgetary reasons, leaving me unemployed. 

I was foolish to trust them, which was my mistake. I learned my lesson. But, at the same time, I was directly lied to numerous times throughout the process.

I decided that the least I could do was warn everyone else.

What happened? I failed to act, and HR argued it was a fireable offense on my behalf. I debated to the death, but HR didn't care. Now I'm left here typing on Reddit, feeling completely defeated. 

How did I fail to act? A low-life, unethical coworker passively-aggressively harassed another coworker behind her back. He was venting to me in private (or so I thought), and his frustration later stooped to attacking her looks. Unbeknownst to me, this was all caught on camera (visual and audio). Management found the tape and pulled both of us into the office. My ""edgy"" coworker chickened out and resigned before punishment came down on him. I decided to face the music, under the impression that I did nothing wrong. I was mistaken. I was canned for failing to immediately report what my coworker disclosed to me, and management needing to find out through camera footage. 

Maybe I'm in the wrong. Maybe I deserved it. But man, it really irks me that I busted my butt for 3 years and got fired on a whim because of what someone else said.

Took me a long time to find a career path that i actually liked ( due to various reasons) and I applied to a Digital marketing agency when I was 28.

Low position, minimum wage (around 700‚Ç¨) but i wanted to learn, since i was very interested. Due to my upbringing and personal issues, I also struggled with saying 'no' to any request, along with me being an overachiever.

The whole vibe in the company was ""we are a family, loyalty for ever, dedication will be rewarded""....

. 

Boss was a serial  entrepreneur and he basically kept on loading more and more work on me, I accepted without complaint. From one project to another, i kept on working and performing, basically never a thank you from his side, just verbal abuse if stuff didn't go his way. I basically had to beg to get a moment monthly salary bump of 70‚Ç¨,.


Boss is bipolar and goes from ""okay' to 'i will fucking fire all of you""  within 3 minutes...every week.

Move forward 2 years

Agency going well, i created a great team of 15+ ppl to handle various tasks. Boss decided to move into a new and very competitive industry. I'm still tasked to oversee the 'old"" team. After all, I will be rewarded for my efforts at some point 

I'm plagued with migraines and stomach issues every week. 

Within 2 weeks from the initial idea, we started working on a new platform. I basically did the extra work of 3-4 people, doing most of the research, connect writing and SEO for 8+ languages ( companies usually have at least 1 person to handle one language). 

Anyway, kept on working 10-12 hour days, because ""we will all be rich, rewarded for our loyalty"". I'm still barely above minimum wage, boss and his bestie COO keep on raking in the big bucks.

People in my position would earn around 2k‚Ç¨ or more easily...

Migraines, stomach issues basically every day, working on painkillers. Different doctors can't find anything wrong with me physically.

After setting up 2 specialized departments for this second project, managing 30+ people, working my ass of, he still tells me in not doing enough, i should push harder, give me more work to do. Every mistake is on me, every achievement is his doing. But okay, soon he will share the wealth with all of us, for our dedication.

One Friday i can't handle the pain ( very bad migraine), i leave work early, thinking I'll be working on Saturday, as usual .

I couldn't.

Barely had the energy to move from bed do fridge. 

Monday comes, same. Couldn't get up, i call in sick, felt horrible for missing work. Doctor writes me a note .

After a week, no change.

After a month, boss calls me ( nobody else of the ""family' from the office), to ask when I'll be back, work is piling up 
Tell him that i don't know .

Another month, still can barely move out of bed. Doctors diagnoze, complete mental and physical burnout. 

Third month, I tell the boss to fire me, since i don't know when I'll be back. He starts complicating about 'paying me extra for my unused vacation days""... Tells me how he did me a solid by paying me an additional 500‚Ç¨. 

I get some papers to sign, that's it. No word from anybody else, at all.

I'm resting for 6 months, burning through my savings, before I can even thing of going to work again. I start going to psychotherapy to fix my shit - best decision ever.

I find out, that ex-boss hired 4 people to cover for my work, they were not enough. 

I got a job with basically 3x pay, my own hours and with work from home without 1 week of looking. 


More than 1 year after I'm out of the company, he contracts me on Instagram, out of all the channels. 

Some BS about 'how are you?"" And 'Do you blame me for how you ended up? Idk.. sometimes i feel like you blame me. Maybe. Not sure what to think. I was super correct with you...""

Wtf? The guy is so far to guys own ass, he wouldn't see a fire even if he was standing in the middle of it. 


The project we've set up is doing great btw, by now it's a multi-million international company, bring very well known in most of EU. Ofc I got jack shit off the profits, apart from a fucked up stomach.

TLDR - boss pushed me to my physical and mental limits for more than 3 years, and then he asks if it's somehow his fault

Friday dinner is our busiest time of the week, a few DAYS into working there it was just me and my manager. I started getting busy so I went to the office to find her scrolling through tiktok and asked her to come help.

Well no I haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôve been busy serving and cooking food for your customers on my own??

Over the years we've received little to no raises and they began chipping away at our benefits. When the new management first came in, they took a week of vacation away. We had had 4 weeks PTO and we got bumped to 3 PTO and 1 SICK. 

We were pissed but we still had more than most so we all just accepted it. Just before the new year, management attempted to bring us down to 1 week PTO and 1 week SICK but there was a lot of resistance from the recent new hires since they accepted the job on the basis of the benefits.

Were I a billionaire, and given all the benefits of the doubt that I had some knowledge of economics and a semblance of insight into the world around me, would it not make the most sense to raise the standard of living of your employees and the average joe as fast as possible?

More spending power will benefit each and every corporation. Every dollar that survives being spent on basic needs will either be used for luxuries or savings, both of which will pad the triple foundation of any business. Power to the consumer will feed into innovation, because companies will have a reason to build better products: People will be willing to pay for them.

Eventually that compounds into invention of superior technologies, literally everyone benefits. Don't worry, you'll still be rich if you're rich. It's just that you'll be a rich person among other rich people, not just a rich person among the poor. I've heard adages saying that it's better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a dragon. But the choice is between the head of chicken and the **head** of a dragon.

Lying about record profits by carving from the wages of your workers. It's literally a diminishing return. At some point you can't gouge them all. Ever read ""The Prince"" by Machiavelli? Even a rat, if cornered with no way to escape, will claw at a cat's eyes. Fine, let's say that the upper class have perfected the formula for keeping the working class *just* sated enough to keep us from revolting. Surely the long-term consequences (value lost over compounding years, the opportunity cost of having the average consumer have tens of thousands in spending income over decades) is less potent than whatever we have now?

You get your billions now, all for what? You traded it in for trillions in the long run. Ok, let's say you're in in for a good time, not a long time. So far, we haven't seen any billionaires return from the dead. But what about your kids? Your heirs? Surely you must love them enough to leave a legacy. Don't they deserve a better life. Wouldn't you want them to have more money than you in the future?

spytsu,The pain of the greeting ‚Äúhello‚Äù.,5,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spytsu/the_pain_of_the_greeting_hello/,0,"Poetry from 60+ years ago. Some things don't change much.

# The Name on the Marble

  

The workman that lives in the hovel,  
The boss that dwells on the hill,  
The sweat and the blood on the handle,  
The manicured hands in the till.

The dirt and grime of construction,  
The carpeted floors in the hall,  
The flirting with death and destruction,  
The driving, hitting the ball.

The names on buildings in cities,  
The nameless who died on the job,  
The rich, the minks and the kitties,  
The banquet, corn on the cob.

The paycheck on Friday‚Äìexistence,  
The corporate bonds in the vault,  
The union, the strike, the resistance,  
The placing of blame and of¬†fault.

The exam, the query, inspection,  
The son-in-law wanting the job,  
The waiting, the hope, the rejection,  
The appointment, the relative, slob.

The saving of pennies in vases,  
The banknotes agleam in the¬†jar,  
The worn-out shoes and their laces  
The worship of golf and of par.

The limousine parked at the races,  
The clunker driven to work,  
The feasting on pheasant, the graces,  
The luxury, coffee to perk.

The sables worn to the masses,  
The ginghams worn to the same,  
The distinction between the classes,  
The ‚ÄúHallowed Be Thy Name.‚Äù

The love of a buddy while working,  
The fear of the guy from below,  
The risk of death always lurking,  
The pain of the greeting ‚Äúhello‚Äù.

The violent death on the rigging,  
The demise of the lush on the bed,  
The sound of the sextons digging,  
The laugh in the schemer‚Äôs head.

The expensive coffin‚Äìbread leaven,  
The pine box priced to sell,  
The expensive journey to heaven?  
The cut-rate journey to hell?

sq3jp7,Let‚Äôs have a conversation about small businesses and raising the minimum wage.,2,0.6,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq3jp7/lets_have_a_conversation_about_small_businesses/,19,"TL/DR; There needs to be some way to help (i.e. governmental assistance) small businesses that would be destroyed by raising the minimum wage. 

I have had an issue with a misconception I‚Äôve seen on this sub that is troubling me. The idea that if a small business can‚Äôt afford $__/hr, they shouldn‚Äôt be in business. I‚Äôm here to tell you that this is not a cut and dry issue. 

Backstory: 
My wife founded and owns a very small outdoor recreational gear store. She has 10+ employees and did roughly $600k in business last year. That‚Äôs not good as far as bigger retail stores go (REI‚Äôs stores usually make millions/year). It is definitely not what someone would call profitable, but it is actually a ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô business in that it is making more money every year than the previous and is extremely loved by the community and the employees. Most of her employees make ~$12/hr with no benefits (other than pro deals on gear). Management and even the accountant only makes ~$15/hr. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be miserable right? They love it! There‚Äôs very little turnover and they even hang out off hours for clubs, classes, and events. Definitely above what most would consider normal employee loyalty. One of the reasons they don‚Äôt mind the low pay is they know that my wife makes the same pay as them, about $30k, as the owner! The only reason she‚Äôs able to make a living is because she‚Äôs that type-A person who has another full time job, a couple rental properties, and helps manage my (very small) roofing business. Basically she never stops working. 

So your saying to yourself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal? If their pay goes up, just raise the prices‚Äù. Well it‚Äôs already what you would call ‚Äòhigh-end‚Äô prices. She already charges more than REI for most things. She can get away with that because of customer loyalty, most who appreciate small local businesses and know that that comes at a price. But obviously that loyalty can be pushed only so far. 

If you can‚Äôt tell from my short description, trust me, this is exactly the type of business r/antiwork people would love to patronize. But paradoxically I get the feeling that if you judged it solely on r/antiwork‚Äôs principals, most of you would hate it. My biased opinion is that without this type of business, the REI‚Äôs of the world would take over and price gouging would ensue, ultimately hurting r/antiwork‚Äôs agenda. 

So I want have a discussion about what you all think. Is there a way for businesses that are already barely surviving to continue to exist in an ideal ($23/hr) r/antiwork world?",1644597424.0

I'm making this post partially to bring attention to that, and similar posts. I'm also making it to say *appreciate damn janitors*. Cuz wow.

The replied saying that they will be having interviews next week and to schedule a time to come in. I thought that was kinda weird so I scheduled a time for next week.

Next week rolls around and it's time to go to this interview. It's a bit of a hike but no big deal, I get to listen to more of my audiobook.

I turn the corner and see a building with an ""Impeach Biden"" flag and I think ""Oh god, is that who I'm interviewing for?"" I look back at my GPS and I still have about 0.1 miles around a bend in the road to go. Whew! I keep going and then see another building with the same ""Impeach Biden"" flag. This time, it is the building I'm supposed to go interview for.

I made a snap decision and thought, ""Anyone proud enough in their capitalist, fascist views to wave a flag like that, is not worth my time, nor worth working for."" So I drove home.

No real moral of the story I guess, but I thought you would enjoy my close encounter.

My previous job was a manager at pizza hut getting paid 12.50 an hour. I decided to quit bc I wasn't making enough. I am not a cashier at target making 15 an hour. 

So getting into the story I always arrive 5 minutes before my shift bc I can clock in 5 min before and it adds up over time. Breaks where started as soon as you got off the register so I was always irritated by that but I never complained and was always taking the right amount of time. One day I went on lunch and the manager didn't tell me to go. A coworker at guest service did bc they are able to do so when a manager is busy. I get clock out at 7:02 and clock back in at 7:33. I call out on the walkie talkie that I'm back from lunch and go to send another coworker to lunch. About an hour later I overhear one of my coworkers tell my manager that I am still on lunch (about 1 hour and 30 minutes) my manager (let's call him jerry)  proceeds to call me into his office and started off with pleasantries. Later into the convo 

Jerry: ""I've been noticing your late to work and take extended breaks constantly.""

Me: ""I'm always 5 min early and never take extended breaks, if I'm ever late it's bc of traffic and only by a few minutes"" 

Jerry: ""even if it is a few minutes it disrupts our team with their breaks and lunches, we have to wait till you come in to send them on break"" 

(That's a lie, they only wait when someone is currently on it before sending another team member to go)

Me': ""ok""

Jerry: ""I also learned you a really long lunch today, over an hour long""

Me: I clocked out at 7:02 and clocked back in at 7:33. I never took an extended break, multiple people saw me come back from lunch and heard me call it out on the radio"" 

Jerry: (looks perplexed) ""either way you need to be on time,  otherwise the next time we have this conversation will be our last. Do you even want to work here""

Me: ""yes"" (in my head I'm like fuck no) 

Jerry: ""ok you can go back""

I'm sharing this bc not ONE time has anyone bothered to look at the time clock, or even try to gather information about the truth. I spoke to HR and they themselves didn't know about that conversation. Every conversation a lead has with a member about correction of any kind needs to be documented in a report. In otherwords it was a bluff. I even showed her a recording over the conversation as proof. But here's the kicker, one of my coworkers CONSTANTLY takes 45 min breaks when it's supposed to be a 15. And a 2 hour lunch when it's supposed to be 30 min. Today I found out that she 100% knows that bc she had an alarm to go back, she juts dismissed it and doesn't go back on the floor but yet she isn't getting fired and no one is doing anything about it. The managers complain about it too. So I don't understand why I'm being ""attacked"" over false allegations when someone else is doing so much worse. And this story is one of MANY that has happened. I have only been at target for 8 months but yet I am now the senior as I'm the only employee (other then the manager) who has been there the longest. I only stay bc I have bills and I won't be able to find a job that pays as much if not more. I have talked to HR after this conversation with Jerry and the managers have been getting better bus not good enough. The store runs south better when no manager is at the front. It's pathetic that we work better and more efficiently without one.",1644564818.0

sppork,Only time leaving a company felt this good...,19,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sppork/only_time_leaving_a_company_felt_this_good/,0,"I worked for for a previous employer for nearly 9 years. It was union work and I spent 4 years of my apprenticeship with him and was a foreman for 5 years after that. He was an asshole on purpose to so many people... but, because I just so happen to be autistic at being a foreman (almost literally), he made a metric sh\*t ton of money off of me; so he left me alone. It was nice to have him on my side when the superintendents and/or engineers wanted to push me around but I hated how he treated some of his own guys. I tried to protect them as much as possible but he loved to constantly stir up sh\*t for no reason.

For example, we started a new project which requires us to demolish (demo) a lot of the existing building first. The superintendent, who had been decent to us this first day on the job, said to leave one of the A/C units connected that fed the room he was intending to make his office until his mobile office showed up. My boss looked at me, said ""follow me"", walked to the panel which fed the panel that powered all of the units, told me to cut the feeders off at the pipe entering the panel, had me throw the peices of wire in his truck, and drove away immediately. Me and my apprentice started demo'ing the 20 or so units and in about an hour, the superintendent found us and said his room is getting hot. I told him my boss had instructed me to cut the wire. Year and half project that was this superintendent trying to ruin everything we did or needed to do because on day one my boss wanted f\*uck up someone's day for no reason.

Well, he decided to go non-union and simply assumed I would want to go with him as a ""partner"". There was not a lot of work so I didn't want to say anything until I got as much work as possible before he made the switch. I was his master license carrier for his shop that allowed him to be in business, but other than that, I never signed up as a partner nor had anything in writing that I was a partner or organizer of this new entity. I think he thought all the talk about being a partner would distract me from the fact that it wasn't on paper. I may helped by playing dumb to keep a paycheck until the switch.

Finally, after what seemed like 4 months of bullsh\*ting me, the week had come and I realized in order to make sure I get my last paycheck I would have to work the first 2 days of the next pay period under the new company like I'm all aboard.  The last day as a union shop was the day before payday and, not too surprising, he started saying as a partner you have to be able to miss a few paychecks while the work comes in. I was standing in his office just listening like I'm a child getting in trouble and taking it while he reluctantly preparing my last check. He was laying on real thick, being a true condescending asshole saying, things like how can I expect to go into business if I can't budget enough to jave a savings account and how it is common to not get paid regularly for the first 6 months of business. He then said I made good money a few months back and what happened to that money? That if I'm going to be a partner I need to handle my money better.

I know all he was doing is being a loudmouth asshole so I would be uncomfortable asking for a paycheck every week. And I was trying to keep him believing I would be staying; until I could cash that check. So I ate his bowl of sh\*t with ""Yes sir. I totally get it"".

It was after hours when he finally quit bitching and handed me the check. So I went to his bank and cashed the check the next day (Saturday). Once I had cash in hand I had my wife follow me to work, dropped off my company vehicle with everything inside and was done.

He called me Monday morning talking cautiously like, ""What's going on?"" I just said, ""I thought about what you said and you're right. I'm not good enough with money to go 6 months without a paycheck. I hate to turn down such a gracious offer of being a partner but I can hardly make it one week without a paycheck. I'll just have to settle for grunt work. I don't want to weigh you down with my needs"". I basically repeated everything he told me the previous Friday so that he could feel like his rant was the reason I was leaving. I wanted him to feel the backfire. 

He started tap dancing saying, ""Now we can figure out a way around that. We could have a credit account for making sure you have a steady paycheck. I just meant that times can be harder when you were in business for yourself. But there's things we can do buddy"".

I just said, ""No. I don't wanna ruin your new company by being so needy."" I wanted to tell him I was never going to work for the new company but it was much more fun to watch him eats every damn word of his and scramble to try and undo his damage.

He closed up shop. No master: no money.",1644551781.0

I'm to be tapped as a construction foreman (for context, I'm a 3rd year electrician in a hyper specialized field with 10 years of experiance on the more difficult end of things of the industry) It'll be my first time as foreman and it's a departure from what I do everyday, there will be a rather sharp learning and relearning curve but I'm quite capable of taking this on, and management seems to agree throughly. That said, I'm hoping for a $10 an hour bump. This would put me in just a touch less then some other foreman (some of which are journeymen, others have never been electricians, most haven't been in the industry as long as me) which I think would be fair. I'm wondering if there is any advice for:
1) getting my $10 an hour overall with little fight.
2) getting it right off the hop even though I'll be shadowing for about a month before I'm left to fend for myself. 
3) I have a couple other perks I'm hoping to get but this $10 an hour is one I'm super rigid about and would be okay to suffer the others

The customer enquires about the price of an item and I tell him a price, manager says nothing, the price I gave him was the price that 80% of our stock goes for, only select items have different prices. The system being offline I have no way to double check the price.

This morning comes and I get a call from one of the other managers. I undercharged a customer by R70 ($3). Manager furiously shouting at me for not double checking the prices how dare I make an educated guess and not call him (remember i was being rushed by the other manager whom didnt correct the price). He ended the call telling me hes taking it out of my pay. Ok.

I get paid less than minimum wage. And make 1% commission on total sales IF total sales exceeds an unreasonable amount. On a good day I make about  R50 ($2) commission. He essentially wants me to pay more than half my daily rate for this.

Whenever this conversation comes up at work or anywhere really, people always say ""it's only 8 hours"" or ""just stay another hour, its more money"" 

Let me explain something to everyone.

I wake up and i spend 35  minutes to get ready for work.
I clear the snow off my car and warm it up for 5 minutes. 
I spend 35 minutes to go to work and sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes so im not late or too early. 
I clock in, and start working for 9 hours, but i punch out for my 30 minute break so really 9 hours and 30 minutes. 
i finish and let me car warm up for 5 minutes. 
i drive 45 minutes home because i work on a highway the U-turn is 10 minute addition. 
i wash up and get comfy after work for about 30 minutes and wind down. 

lets add up how much time ""work"" really takes up in minutes.
35 + 5 + 35 + 10 + 540 + 30 + 5 + 45 + 30 = 735 / 60= 12 hours and 15 minutes. and i only get paid for 9 of them.

Work is an all day thing. and i have to sleep for 8 hours. 
that gives me about 4 hours a day to cook, clean, have a hobby, make love, shop, etc. What a waste of time.

I just bought a used car too, and it wont always start in cold weather so I spend an a few minutes every morning to see if it will start before i get ready, and if it does i continue. if it doesnt i get the jumper cables and spend an hour trying to maneuver another car in front of mine to jump it let it warm up. 

Just so i can make enough money to just barely afford this car to get me to work. and my mortgage... but thats about it. 
I dont have netflix or internet or anything special, my girlfriend has to pay for that stuff because i cant afford them. I contribute to savings but debt grows faster than savings. Snd surprises come up like i need a new water heater or the baseboard heat is leaking. the other day i went to brush my teeth and the water came out brown... time to spend $500 on a plumber. 

So all in all, ill finish my rant by saying, i live in the tristate area making $70k a year, i can barely keep my head above water and i dont know how you all do it on less in the same area. i help out others where i can but karma hasn't been very nice to me lately. thanks for listening.",1644545026.0

You're probably pretty pissed that your parents didn't have shit to offer and now you are stuck in an endless cycle of wage slavery barely getting by for 50+ years. I'd be there, too, if I hadn't ""married up"" to a higher caste.

  
So my logic here is that having children of your own to suffer in poverty with you is inflicting the same generational poverty and hellish existence on yet another generation simply because ""you wanted"" them, despite being unable to give them a decent life.  Even though It isn't your fault you can't provide them with a decent start in life, but seeing as most of us cannot, and are aware that our lives are generally pretty miserable, why do so many people still do it?  Is it not the definition of selfishness?

  
Is it not more prudent to forgo having children then?  Why create more cogs for the capitalist machine?  We can vote all we want but we see how well that's worked for us.  We've worked hard, and that hasn't worked for us.  The hot take is that *we can only ""fix"" things by non-action*.  Don't buy stupid pointless shit, (especially from Amazon,)  collectively on a monthly basis why not we pick a brand or product to not buy any of as to hurt those industries en masse, we can organize call-out protests where we simply don't show up for 10 days straight and watch them squirm.  (Apparently the government has told on themselves and 10 days is just too much to miss work, even if harboring a deadly virus.  (Thanks Covid.)    


And we can choose to not make more cogs for the capitalist machine as long as it takes until things improve.  


The system as we know it isn't changing anytime soon. It's 2022 and the minimum wage is still $7.25.  
Most of us don't have health insurance or have shitty insurance. Is is not selfish to bring children into a capitalist hellscape to suffer similarly as you, and how can you or anyone else justify it aside from a shallow assumption their life will just magically be better and hoping that they'll just escape the rat race on their own without you being able to provide the tools in which to assure some class mobility?

  
Is anyone's selfish desire to fall into the status quo and have a family worth bringing another innocent into the world to suffer for 80 years the way most of us do? Is there any good or selfless reason to have kids in this dumpster fire? Is there any reason that doesn't start with ""I wanted...?""",1644537428.0

I was doing a lot of interviews at the time and they were all pretty much the same, phone then zoom then in person. One in particular was very different. They started off normal with a phone interview, and in that call ha asked if he could send me some links via email. One was just to their website, but the others were a personality test and a skills analysis test. Those were no big deal, maybe an hour of my time total. 

I had a zoom interview next where all they talked about were the results and how they were above average. Awesome, so they want to schedule another zoom interview. 

The next zoom interview was very standard, and at this point I really thought they might offer me something. 

I get an email asking if I can do another zoom interview with someone else, sure why not. I really thought this would be offer time. Nope, just another standard interview. 

Another email, ‚Äúwe would like to meet in person before hiring you on.‚Äù They give me an address and time. I show up and they gave me the wrong address. That‚Äôs fine because I got there early and was able to find it and still be on time. I go on in and I‚Äôm escorted to the break room because the manager is out at the moment. So I wait maybe 10 minutes and the manager shows up finally. He‚Äôs wearing pajama pants and a go team USA shirt (this was during the summer olympics.) I find this odd but continue on. 

We go into his office and he has a standing desk and asks me to sit, but he doesn‚Äôt lower his desk. He‚Äôs also got a space heater on full blast (like I said this was the dead of summer.) He says ‚Äúso why did you stop by today?‚Äù and that was the moment I knew I would never work there. 

He shows me some stuff on his computer then says have a good weekend. I was in his office maybe 5 minutes total. I went home knowing even if I was offered something I wasn‚Äôt going to accept. 

The following week I get an email asking me to have a zoom call with someone new. I did the call because I was curious what they would offer me, and I wanted to see their reaction when I denied it. During this call he tells me that they are offering me two positions and would like me to review them and choose between the two. 

In their follow up email they ask me to write up a presentation on why I‚Äôve chosen one job over another and they‚Äôd like me to present that over a zoom call. So I ghosted them. I was already done with them and was only following through to see what would happen.

But there has to be some folks on here out of the 1.7 million plus members who work white collar jobs, or are headed in that direction that share our values and sentiments. Where are y'all at?

Why does it seem to be so difficult to effect positive change when the working class is what keeps our economy running? Where are all the left wing idealist liberals who could effect positive social change like UBI or increased minimum wages? Why is it that the few are able to dominate the many and tell us we're broke because we're lazy and it's all our fault?

I was only contracted to work 40 hours a week but ended up being pressured to work 50 hours minimum, I started having panic attacks in the middle of service and developed insomnia. I would work from 10am to sometimes 12-12.30am because they expected us to stay and clean after work. They had promised me at least ¬£10.00 an hour plus tips, they were paying me ¬£8.90, when I confronted them over it they said it was ¬£8.90 but the tips made up for it, which btw was untrue as you only got paid about 13 hours worth of the pay you should have been getting by that explanation. We had a verbally abusive manager who would talk trash about other employees in front of us, so he definitely talked about me as well.

My breaking point came when they made me fill in for people who had walked out which meant I worked 120 hours in two weeks. My body and my mind had broke, I had bad anxiety, was sleep deprived and sick, and was always aching. I told my sous chef if I had a panic attack today I was going to quit, lo and behold, I did. We spoke about me doing less hours and told them I was taking 2 weeks off by the doctors for overwork and stress. They then chose to fire me on christmas eve by sending me my p45 in an email with no explanation.

With companies still making record profit along with record inflation, with billionaires paying less income tax than the average joe, why aren't we on a general workers strike nation wide?

Seriously why not? Go on strike and force congress to actually pass a law that prevents billionaires from loop holing out of income tax. Literally make them pay their paltry 34% income tax. Every sector, every city. It's taken place in the past in cities, and it works. So what's stopping us? What's the biggest hold up? teachers, truckers, grocery store workers, gas station attendants, cleaners, nurses, police, fire, everyone!

Or even specifically for individual sectors? Nation wide teacher strike for actual school funding, better teacher pay, protections from academic censorship.

Truckers... actually protesting what matters???? Like bullshit contractor labels, scammed out of pay during loading/unloading, treated like an expendable item by your bosses.

Amazon workers, maybe a chance to pee without being fired.

Grocery workers.... protest for a living wage, not have to have food stamps while working in a place that sells food.

...

Nearly every industry for the middle class is underpaid. And the sad part is 50% of the working class isn't worried about the ungodly sums of money being hoarded and loop holed at the top. They are worried about the guy making 25% less than them on the same rung and not the guy making 39,000% more than them who pays less tax then they do.

So what would it take for a general strike, either by sector or simply nation wide? What percent of the work force would need to go on strike to make the change? What % needs to strike to force congresses hand to actually legitimately close the billionaire loophole??????????

There would no doubt be temporary pain for the middle class to do this, but no matter how you slice or dice it nearly every issue in society can be linked back to too much money being hoarded out of circulation at the top, and an underpaid middle class.

So, what will it take? Why not?",1644554339.0

I am going to be as vague as possible. I work in the corporate housing industry and they have seen an influx of international requests which requires someone to be working from 8pm-7am central and Saturday/Sundays day and night shifts. Our managers told us on a meeting and asked people to volunteer to be ""on call""  for the night shifts and Saturday/Sunday until they could find people who could actually work. 

&#x200B;

Now being ""on call"" is not as bad as actually having to be at your desk working, but the base pay is $50 and caps out at $150 if you take ""6 or more calls"" for an 11 hour shift. Which equates to $13.60 an hour. Also, if you are on call during the night shift you are still expected to come in and work your 8 hour shift the next day. Now, I am a deep sleeper so essentially I would have to stay up the whole night and then still come and work my 9-5 job the next day.

&#x200B;

They keep on emphasizing it is voluntary but we just got an email today that replying to the email asking us is mandatory and they gave us a list of the slots still needing to be filled. Mostly Saturdays and Sundays from 7am-8pm, 8pm-7am and one Thursday night shift. **They also gave us a ""fair warning"" if they don't get the slots filled for next month they may become mandatory and will be assigned.**

&#x200B;

However, we were under the impression they were hiring someone to work these hours and now it is seeming like we might have to do this going into March as well. I don't know what to do because it seems like they are threating us w/mandatory on call shifts next month so someone will take these remaining slots in February.  I feel like I am going crazy because I refuse to give in to the pressure and work these slots because I appreciate a work-life balance and we are already understaffed and work past our normal weekday shifts anyways.",1644602666.0

sq51th,"Capitalism, Communism, and the Corporate State",0,0.33,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq51th/capitalism_communism_and_the_corporate_state/,2,"I've been lurking for a long while in here, and there's been a lot of low- and mid- level chatter about ""capitalism bad"", and ""we need co-ops"" or ""we need socialism/communism"".

I would like to posit a theory of my own.
TL;DR, for those that want it:
""Capitalism and Communism are two sides of the same coin, and either side can as easily be fouled by the mud of corporatism."" There's your soundbite.

And now to the TEDTalk...

Capitalism and Communism share (in my mind at least), a common theme, which is the idea that the worker should own their work.

Where they differ is that Communism, when tried outside of laboratory conditions, runs everything through the State. The entire Motherland IS the Company Store.
  To redistribute goods and services from those who have too much to those who have not enough REQUIRES an extensive logistical network, which then requires Big Picture People (managers), and then Whole Picture People (C-suite). Oops, a corporation.
  Add to that some odd ideas about how equality works, and you get very interesting little oddities like cutting the heads off the tops so ""everyone is equal"". That farmer is shit at it, and you're bonkers amazing, so you're in line for execution. Yeah, that actually happened, then people starved...but only the rank-and-file. The leadership still ate well. Everyone called it Communism, but it was actually Corporate Communism.
  This isn't to say Communism is bad as such. I'm not actively trying to swing for the jugular on Communism. I'm even admitting that it wasn't real Communism, in spite of the people doing it claiming it was. I do have some good-faith issues with Communism, but that's for a different essay. Perhaps even a different subreddit.

On to Capitalism.
  Once again, Capitalism posits the idea that the worker owns their own work. We see this played out in wages. ""I did a thing, pay me."" Pretty straightforward. However, capitalism is, by nature, a harsher system, and rewards people somewhat capriciously. What one person does might not work out for the next, for any number of factors. One person might make rocking chairs and do well enough to get by, and have a little extra on the side, while another person might start making a different kind of rocking chair, and be doing so well that they can't keep up with demand.
This is the risk that comes with ownership. You. Own. ALL. Of. It. Success, failure, and everything in between, it's all yours. The upside is that success is sweeter, but the downside is that failure is the bitterer for it.

Side Note: If you want to try your hand at owning your own business, get into trucking, do a year or two to learn the ropes, and then work your way to full owner of your very own truck as a lease-operator before finally going owner-operator. If you fail, you can revert back to company driver relatively easily, and prevent too much loss from occurring.

Now, Corporatism.
  The corporation is a massive, eldritch entity. Oddly enough, it's behaviors mimic our own. How much do you think about your arms? How about your legs? Lungs? Liver? WHEN do you think about them? Do you resent it when your feet have pins and needles because they fell asleep? Do you specifically reward your body parts because they did well during ""crunch time""?
Or do you just do the things your brain comes up with to do, when you've got the time/energy/money to do it?

PLEASE do not mistake this as an attempt to drum up support/sympathy for the corpos. Let them rot, for all I care. I am only attempting to explain their behavior in a way the average person can understand.

The strength of the corporation is it's ability to see what us lowly mortals in the trenches cannot. It's failing, however, is that it behaves very much like us. It doesn't think about it's feet very much. When's the last time you did anything special to recognize your feet?
Corpos are unfeeling machines. They must be controlled. If we cannot control these machines, then A.I. will utterly destroy us, because A.I. will follow in the footsteps of their prototype: the corporation. Like an A.I., corpos have some level of intelligence, and can look out for it's best interests. When you compare scale, we are ants to the corpos. THIS is why we live in a Corporate Democracy, practicing Corporate Capitalism. We failed to control the wolves, and the watchdogs. Now the watchdogs are controlling us, and guided by the wolves.

At it's heart:
Capitalism preaches self-value and independence.
Communism preaches the value of others and teamwork.
Corporatism preaches the value of scale and exploitation.

Corporations MUST be controlled, and preferably dismantled, or we will all revert to serfdom. I, for one, do NOT welcome our corporate overlords.

I've (29) been working as a dental hygienist in the state of Connecticut for 6 months now. I am not new to hygiene but I am new to the area. I have never worked in a dental office like this ever in my life. 

It started out ok. Everyone was nice enough. Some people had attitude problems but didn't seem personal so whatever. About a month after I started the other hygienist (in her 60s) there called the dentist and told her that I was saying all kinds of nasty things about her. Mentioning how I didn't like the office, how I didn't like working with the dentist, etc. She would twist a lot of what I was saying into something completely untrue. The doctor confronted me about this and I was honest saying I don't know why she would say all of that. I asked her about it and she first denied it and said that the dentist must have misheard her or that maybe I was too emotional?? Idk. She eventually admitted she lied and called because I had asked for new equipment that was broken because I needed it to work, one of which is a chair that I sit on while I work with patients. The chair would sink to the floor and I couldn't get a proper ergonomic seating position on it. Other hygienist, that we will call Karen since she acts like one, was pissy because they ordered me a new chair. The chair she sits on is over $1000 and was given to her for free by the other dentist who recently retired. I was getting a crummy chair, standard chair and she got all jealous about it?? Mind boggling. The dentist told me that I was not the first person that Karen had done this to, not even then second one, and that people have left the practice because of her. Dentist assured me that she believed me and not to worry about it. That was only the start of a very long and toxic work environment. 

I have endured quite a bit from almost every employee so I will list them each. 

The assistant (37? ish):

‚Ä¢She constantly yelled at me about sterilization and cleaning instruments. I would often miss half of my lunch because I would be cleaning up after everyone since they left for lunch already. No matter how much I did, no matter how well I did things, it was never enough for the assistant. After the whole thing happened with Karen, the office Manager (OM) moved me to a different room, one farther away from Karen. It was set up as a dental room so I needed to move things around and convert it into a hygiene room. I got the direct ok from OM to do this. I see the assistant complaining about the sterilization area not being taken care of by me and hear OM say that I was told to focus on something else. Assistant comes up to me while I have a patient in my chair and screams about how I'm not pulling my weight and yada yada. My patient can hear everything. It's embarrassing. Best part is they're all her instruments! It's not like I'm leaving mine behind or something, that I'd understand but this is because I'm not acting as their personal Cinderella at all times. I don't mind doing everyone's instruments, it's what is expected at an office, we help each other out. But this place was unbelievable. ‚Ä¢She would leave passive aggressive sticky notes everywhere calling others lazy for nothing doing things a certain way. ‚Ä¢She screamed at me for not setting up her dental trays. I have never set up dental trays as I have never been an assistant. No one has ever asked me to do this. At 7:50am, as soon as I get into the office, she screams at me and asks me why I don't do this. I let her know that I didn't know I was supposed to and that no one has shown me how. She walks away yelling about how it's not her job to show me how to do things? ‚Ä¢She came into my room when I was with a patient to complain about me using a specific x-ray sensor. I put it back where I found it and she said I was not to use that one as it was HER sensor even though it's for office use. ‚Ä¢I let her know that we weren't following the manual's instructions on how to properly sterilize the instruments, something I brought up before but received push back on. She was screaming at me about how she's been doing this for four years. She doesn't care what the manual says, she will continue to do it the way she's been doing it. 

Dentist (37):

‚Ä¢She would embarrass me in front of patients. I had one patient in my chair who said how much he enjoyed working with me and how thorough I was. When she did her exam she said out loud and in front of the patient that I had left a lot of tartar and to go back and get it. I don't even remember if there actually was any tartar there but I remember wondering why she said that. ‚Ä¢She constantly would go against my suggestions for patients with periodontal disease saying they don't have bone loss or bleeding even though they definitely did and I would take intraoral pictures for notes to back up my argument. She once had me sit and show her how I measure the gum tissue, in front of the patient, after disagreeing with my treatment even though I still wholeheartedly believe he needed a deep cleaning. ‚Ä¢She spent 30 extra minutes doing an exam on a patient, telling them they don't need deep cleaning, etc, and went into the next patient's appointment time. The patient left because of the wait and she came back and screamed at me for taking too long and how she could not believe I made him leave by taking so long. ‚Ä¢She would go to Karen's room to do her exams and then not do mine. I often would wait over 30 minutes or more while waiting for an exam, making me run behind for my next patients. ‚Ä¢I scheduled to get in house dental whitening. It was $312, no discount for us and that was fine for me. They applied the product 4 times for 15 minutes each. About an hour after treatment I was in such horrible pain. The worst pain I've ever experienced. Nothing would help at all, no pain killers even took the edge off. I called in the next morning because I was in so much pain. Dentist told me she never gets complaints about the pain and she's never heard anything like it. I notice after a day or two the whitening is already going back to my original color so I look up Opalescence online and it specifically says that they do 2 twenty minute treatments and sometimes 3 but they don't encourage 3 because it will cause sensitivity. I call up the whitening company and let them know what's happened. The representative says that the whitening didn't last because it wasn't applied properly. She also let me know that they should have given me whitening trays to go home with to continue the treatment as the initial in office whitening is meant to ""open up the teeth"" so to speak and take in continued whitening at home. I talk to the dentist about this and she says this is how they taught her in school. I ask her if she is maybe confusing it for another in office whitening called Zoom which does do 4 treatments of 15 mins. She changes her story and says how she started doing it this way because patients were complaining of pain when they did it the 20 mins way. When I talked to her a few days ago she said she had never heard of anyone getting sensitivity and pain but now it was so common she had to change how they did it? Her story then becomes how she also experiences pain when she does the whitening this ""new way"". 

The front desk (60s?):

‚Ä¢Scolded me about not following procedures in front of the patient I just worked on even though I absolutely DID follow the proper procedure. ‚Ä¢Told one of my patients she had to charge him for something else even though I did not do that treatment. His insurance didn't cover it and he never came back. ‚Ä¢I had a 19 year old who requested the use of nitrous oxide for her cleaning. I was told we were out of nitrous so as she was checking in, I let her know that we did not have nitrous and asked her if she wanted to do an exam and x-rays today and to come back for nitrous when we restocked it. She agreed but she started to cry and asked if she could step back and call her mom. I said, of course, and went to set everything up. When I came back to receive her, front desk is yelling at me (in front of the waiting room) about how cruel I am and that my patient is crying in the waiting room and I need to comfort her. I let her know that I already comforted her and she asked for a moment to call her mom. I bring the patient back, we get along great! She gets her cleaning done without nitrous and is so happy since she's not gotten a cleaning without nitrous in over 10 years. She says she wants to see only me when she comes back. Before front desk leaves I let her know that I know she comes from a good place and that I appreciate her but she can come off as patronizing. She proceeds to tell me that she doesn't care, I didn't handle the situation properly and that she will never change. Ever since then she literally did not say a single word to me. This was several weeks ago. 

Office Manager (50s?): 

‚Ä¢Wrote ""What somebody thinks about you is none of your business"" on our break room white board for some reason. ‚Ä¢Whenever I would approach her for guidance regarding the constant harassment from the other employees she would make excuses for them and somehow turn it around on me. When I tried to discuss with her about front desk she said she agreed with front desk and that I did not handle the situation properly. I reminded her that the patient was very happy with how everything turned out and I didn't want to bring her to the back with all of the sharp instruments everywhere as I felt that would have been overwhelming to be around if she had dental anxiety. Her only response to that was ""she didn't seem that happy when she came up to check out"". That's because she had a cavity.... but I digress. She also used this as an opportunity to tell me that I was no longer allowed to get up to let the dentist know I was ready for an exam and that I had to wait for her instead.l because it is ""unprofessional"".... ‚Ä¢I let her know that our medical history charts in the system are almost always incomplete. I alerted her to a specific instance where Karen wrote down the the patient had a knee replacement and was unsure if she needed to take an antibiotic before cleaning in her notes but it was not in the chart. I had to go searching for it which is not something we should have to do. It was also incorrect, she had both of her hips replaced and she DID need an antibiotic before treatment. OM came back at me about how it's the patients' fault that their health history is not correct. No idea what her mental gymnastics was to get to that conclusion, but ok. ‚Ä¢The dentist called out for possible COVID-19 and OM and front desk made me lie to patients saying dentist was out due to a family emergency. ‚Ä¢I caught covid from the dentist and my area was completely out of tests. I had a fever of 103.2 for almost 5 days. Every single day I was harassed by OM about how I didn't know it was covid bc I didn't have a test and asking me if I could go into the office. I had a panic attack outside of an urgent care because they would not see me and she kept encouraging me to go back in and argue with them, call them, etc. ‚Ä¢When I went to discuss with her about the dental whitening I received, she made me feel stupid. Even after I showed her the website where it specifically says how to apply it. I still haven't gotten any apologies or reimbursement for that.

Karen:

‚Ä¢Started the rumor mill about me. ‚Ä¢Kept asking me if I fucked my boyfriend on his birthday. She asked me if I ""gave him a birthday delight"" and I awkwardly laughed and walked away. She came up to me again and asked ""so? Did you give him a little treat??"" I told her it isn't much of a treat if he already ""gets it"" every other morning. I was so uncomfortable with that question but felt that if I didn't answer she wouldn't drop it. ‚Ä¢Would constantly bother me about how I got up to let the dentist know I was ready for an exam. ‚Ä¢Would constantly hear her and the assistant trash talking me. Saying they couldn't wait for me to leave, they're not going to help me with instruments etc. ‚Ä¢Went into the waiting room and told a patient that was in my schedule to request her next time. Patient expressed to me that she wanted to see me again but felt pressured into seeing Karen for her next visit because of her going up to her. When I brought this up to OM, she said ""I've never seen Karen do that"". ‚Ä¢I prefer my instruments to be bagged in the larger pouch because I noticed they puncture less. I don't share my instruments with Karen so shouldn't be a big deal but for some reason it is and becomes a thing with her.

And all this brings us to yesterday. Yesterday I was doing my instruments and noticed Karen put her polishing hand piece in the ultrasonic bath. I know you probably don't know what that means but they shouldn't go in there as it will damage them. Went over to her and said ""hey don't forget that these don't go in there"" and she literally came at me. Very aggressive, screaming at me, throwing her hands in my face etc. I said ""ok sorry just drop it"" and she literally followed me around the office screaming and putting her hands in my face. I went up to the front to talk to OM and said hey can I talk to you she says ""can it wait?"" And I say ""no it absolutely cannot"" and she gave me attitude. So I said in front of everyone including patients. ""after this next patient, I'm going home. I quit"". I go back to my op to set up for next pt, OM comes back to try and talk to me. I'm wiping and cleaning, om is in the doorway and the Karen is behind her screaming and throwing her hands around. OM keeps trying to talk to me while Karen is screaming. She leaves and comes back to scream again. Finally OM gets her to go away and she makes excuses for her!! She talks about how they've been cleaning them for years like this etc. Why does it matter. I show her the damage it is doing to the polishers and I remind her that we had to replace 2 of them after only a short time of use. OM goes on to tell me that I'm not friendly because I don't say good morning every time I am in. It was just bullshit. Finally I told her this is why I don't talk to her and to leave me alone. I finish the patient, I clean up. Finish my notes, and I leave.

I was supposed to have a meeting with the regional manager about the issues in the office and the doctor under diagnosing periodontal disease at noon but I couldn't even make it 10am. I ended up talking to him anyway but even that is a whole nother story in itself. 

tl;dr constantly harassed at work by nearly every employee. HR did nothing to help even though I have been consistently vocal about these issues. Quit after coworker was screaming and throwing her hands in my face.",1644527078.0

In tbt past, he would pick the area of communication and say I need to work on my communication with team members. Maybe he is right, but idk, I think I communicate well‚Ä¶If someone is being rude to someone else, I call them on it. If they are being rude to me, I call them on it.

This year we get to pick what our area of improvement is and if he agrees he‚Äôll leave it. If he doesn‚Äôt we will have a conversation about it. 

So what should I put as an area of improvement when I think I‚Äôm a really good worker and can‚Äôt think of an area that needs more work?

Secondly, I think this movement is great and much needed. Thirdly, I am a devout Catholic. I don't expect this to go well, but so you understand my biases. The recent post claiming religion is designed by the rich upset me a bit and I don't think Christianity is the enemy of this movement (although the prosperity gospel definitely is).

I understand that there are many abuses in the name of Christianity. I myself am regularly disgusted with the hypocrisy seen in Christians and the Church itself. It is worth noting that the Bible treats hypocrisy as one of the gravest sins.  
There is a hypocrisy in being richer than the people around you. You cannot have significantly more than others and claim to love them. The first to join the church that didn't sell off their land to live as the 'poor' literally dropped dead (Acts 5, Ananias and Sapphira). My general understanding is that they died not because they had wealth, but because they lied, pretended that they did not, and claimed to be like the first Christians.  
I'll happily be poor, because that doesn't mean my life is bad, it just means I have as much as everyone else. The rich are the problem, and in becoming rich you are the problem. If we strive to be rich we are no better than the abusers.  
This movement will flounder if we all just try to become rich, we need to strive for community and lifting each other up. Relatively, we will still be seen as poor, but we will all have better lives, and the rich will be less rich. When you strive for rich, by definition you leave everyone else behind once you have it.",1644597723.0

I'm really not even sure if this is the appropriate sub, but I'm curious about something.

I'm just shy of 31 years old and have 15 years or customer service/retail exp under my belt and I'm fucking done. For the entirety of 2021 I was a store manager in a tea shop and thought, ""Finally, I've made it. I deserve this. I've earned it."" It was fucking bullshit. Having my handful of employees constantly upset and coming to me for this and that (mostly drama), upset about their pay (which I had zero control over), and never truly having say about how I ran things because the owner had another store just an hour away and was constantly up my ass. I was never offered salary despite constantly taking phone calls and working from home because I had to keep up with sales in our store 100% of the time via a laptop I was given to do just so. I was also expected to maintain inventory (ordering and physically going to the store several times a week), keep the store arranged in a way that would draw better sales with new inventory, keep up to date with our seasonal menu changes so I could properly train employees, cover shifts because no one wanted to if someone called in, all on top of having to work my own shifts behind the counter. I was told I had to work at least 30 hours behind the counter alone because I had the best sales but got my ass ripped because I struggled to balance it all alone.

Up to date, I left just before Xmas and took a job as the only employee of a woman who makes and sells her products online. Custom jewelry, decor, and such. She's a got a little workshop/storefront that never sees a soul come in. It's extremely flexible, pays okay, and I get to be somewhat creative- as much as I can be for product that's not mine, and I still fucking hate it. I've come to realize that it's never going to be enough. It deeply depresses me to have to work for someone else, for corporations that give a fuck less about people, and now even for someone who arrives to create custom products to please the recipient. All of the ideas I give her go under her name, all of the time I spend creating beautiful things and are still not mine. 

I guess my reason for posting is to ask if anyone has gone into business for themselves because they cannot continue to bear working for other people's gain? I want very much to start my own little business making my own products in a workshop out of my garage. The more I work things out in my mind as far as what I'll need and the start up costs alone, I'm scared shitless. There's no more hourly wage to support me if it doesn't work out.

Long story short- 

I‚Äôve worked here for 9 months. In my role for about 4 now. I spent the entire time so far fixing mistakes from the last person, but my job is for 2 people- in one. Every day I get more and more behind because I can‚Äôt keep up, and anytime I mention this to him, he makes it about my lack of work ethic. I‚Äôm working overtime currently and not being paid. He also punishes me for that too. If I try to stay late after work or work on the weekend (unpaid I might add) he says that is a lack of my time management. But the last 3 people who did my job quit due to stress.

At this point he no longer speaks to me, no longer asks about my day, we have no cordial conversations except when he‚Äôs belittling me. (He mocks me sometimes if I ask a question he thinks is stupid) or he constantly will come at me with how what I‚Äôve done has effected other peoples jobs- though he gave me a job I wasn‚Äôt qualified for and is now blaming me because I couldn‚Äôt hack it. He‚Äôs completely used me as a scapegoat to the point where my colleagues won‚Äôt even email me anymore they go through him because they think I‚Äôm incompetent and he will then email me to get it done. It‚Äôs at the point now where he is using me as an example of ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù to the new staff right infront of me. 

I feel so helpless and worthless. I work the hardest out of my team and I work extra hours to keep up and he actually gets angry at me for it. So you understand- in 3 days I received over 500 emails. and these are not things I can just answer right away. It‚Äôs things I need to do work and contact people to find information for. It can take almost an hour or more per inquiry. this is my day to day. 

That‚Äôs not even the extent of it. HR had to get involved because of bullying against me in the office, and he wouldn‚Äôt stick up for me though they admitted to doing it. I‚Äôm honestly so exhausted my health is taking a toll. I barely eat, I don‚Äôt enjoy my time off, I can‚Äôt shower or brush my teeth most days, I feel like a shell of a human being. But I‚Äôve been applying for months and not even a bite. I could walk away and get just a minimum wage job, but then I‚Äôd be out about 25k a year that I‚Äôm making now above that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôve been squeezed into a place I can‚Äôt run from. I brought this all up to HR but they just quit so now I‚Äôm afraid to approach the new one as I don‚Äôt know how they will handle it. 


At this point I‚Äôm just waiting to be fired. If you‚Äôve read this far- thanks

He manages a quick lube place, and his techs all up and quit one day(painfully obvious why now.) He got in touch and said he would start me at what I was making at my previous job and said it was even negotiable. He said I was worth that much and more but that he couldn‚Äôt do much better than that because of the position. I knew it was kind of an entry level position so I was fine with the cap. I mulled it over for a few days and signed on as a temporary thing. 

  One thing led to another and the business with my brother fizzled out because I was dedicating myself to this job for now. Kind of sucked but I figured, oh well I‚Äôll do this for a bit and find something else down the road more permanent. It was good for a while, he hired some other techs and we were getting the shop going again. I noticed pretty quickly that it was a pretty toxic place and that‚Äôs probably what the previous mutiny was about. I started looking a bit for something else, and was waiting to here back about a new opportunity at my previous employer. The longer I was there the more the other techs were getting fed up/offended by his verbal abuse/sporadic moods. It was getting really bad, I had to get out. 

  I found another job and put in my notice. He pulled me aside today and said we had some paperwork to do, I said what kind of paperwork and followed him to the back room. He hands me some exit interview paperwork and I said what‚Äôs this? He says just standard stuff for corporate. I said shouldn‚Äôt someone who‚Äôs not my direct supervisor conduct the exit interview? He says no, that‚Äôs not how this works, to which I replied well that just seems grossly inappropriate to me, shouldn‚Äôt hr do this? He said I am hr, I said no you‚Äôre the manager, just because there isn‚Äôt a specific ‚Äúhr‚Äù position doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt another more appropriate person to do this at the dealership. 
 
  It went straight down the gutter from there. He told me how he knew I would be a pain in the ass and not just walk away gracefully, to which I replied, I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if I let you treat people this way knowing I may be able to change it. He started telling me all the favors he did for me when I was out of work, (he begged me) as if I hadn‚Äôt voluntarily left my former employer, (on fantastic terms, in fact the hr rep that conducted my exit interview said if I was ever in need of a job in the future, she had heard nothing but the best, and would absolutely recommend me
for a rehire) trying to say I wasn‚Äôt worth what he paid me(I didn‚Äôt even negotiate, he started at my current pay rate) I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around how many absolute bullshit contradictions to past statements, that I knew were flat out fallacies, he was spewing. I got sick of going back and forth as to why it was inappropriate so I walked out of the back room to try to go back to work. 
 
 He followed me and I kept saying this is why it‚Äôs inappropriate for you to do the interview. It serves no purpose for the company going forward if they‚Äôre not airing out grievances, be it of outgoing employees or current to, a neutral party. I started getting a little loud because I had said that same thing literally a dozen times or better at that point. He got louder and then said I was causing a scene. I said I was trying to go back to work until my two weeks was up. He said I needed to leave, so I said are you firing me, and he said no you‚Äôve already submitted your resignation, to which I replied, correct which is effective on the 17th, if you wish for me to leave before that date, you are terminating my employment. He said that‚Äôs not how that works and I said I think that‚Äôs exactly how that works, you‚Äôre confused. That went back and forth for another ten minutes and I got sick of his childish shit and said that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll be back later to get my box. 

   When I went back he asked me if I was still being a dick, I said if being honest makes me a dick then I guess so, he said so yes, and I said if you say so I sposeü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I got my shit and said I would like to amend the date on the exit interview that says my last day is the 17th, he looked at me blankly and said what? So I reiterated that he made me leave on this day which is not the last day of my employment per the terms of my resignation, and that I would like that paper to reflect that even if I wasn‚Äôt competing his white wash of an exit interview, so I wrote on it that he asked me to leave on this date and wrote it down next to my signature and took a picture of it and left, but not before he told me to go fuck myself‚Ä¶again! 

  What a great boss!! Caught him editing my hours down from just over 40 to just under, lest he suffer the consequences of them paying me time and a half for less than one tenth of one hour. Just petty thing after petty thing, with someone who I have been friends with for almost 20 years. Ya think ya know a person‚Ä¶ 

  Tl;dr longtime friend asked(begged)me to help him fill a spot in his shop, turns out he‚Äôs a giant asshole to his employees.

Never gotten past the first day. All I can put on my resume is volunteer work. Today I had an interview at Starbucks. I really wanted to get this job since I liked the idea of being a barista. My ride bailed on me so I had to pay a $19 Uber to get there. 

I flunked the interview. I tried to bullshit my through the best I could. Lots of questions like ""can you give me a good example of you doing a group project"" ""can you tell me about your people skills"". No I fucking can't. This is an entry level job. I have no experience. I couldn't work due to my disabilities. I was homeschooled throughout highschool. But I couldn't say that. I lied and paraphrased stories from middle school. 

At the end I asked how I did. She said I flunked and she wouldn't hire me. She said ""it seems like you were saying a bunch of words I wanted to hear but not a lot of concrete examples of you using interpersonal skills. I think you should work on your interviewing skills. At this point I wouldn't hire you."" Not only did I fuck up, but she dissed my interview game. A bunch of vague corporate bullshit that's almost impossible to answer. 

I felt angry. I felt like I fucked up. I was angry at the whole system. I felt degraded. I deserved that fucking job. I'm trying to better myself according to your ideology. I shouldn't have to parade myself and do rhetorical somersaults to impress these corporate taskmasters. I just wanna work for you goddamn it! Why can't you just hire me? 

The lady complained that my answers seemed rehearsed and I didn't give enough concrete examples of people skills. I thought about asking about group projects at church I could do.

I felt like I did everything right. I got a 4.0 throughout my college years held multiple internships and a job during college. Everything was supposed to come together. At first, I was very excited to pave my way. I began applying for employment with an over-the-top amount of enthusiasm. However, over the next six months, my excitement has started to change. I interviewed for countless jobs and was told the same thing. Either they did not want me, wanted me to work insane hours, or offered me enough money to sit near the poverty line. Many jobs even ask for me to work for six months to a year unpaid before considering me. (Sounds insane, I know, but I am sure many others my age will agree) I began to feel something different about the world. The world doesn‚Äôt seem as exciting as it did when I was a child. Or even the past year. Things seem gloomy for the future. Anyone that does not sit at the top is treated like a cog in the machine, and honestly, it is because we allow companies and those that lead us to treat us this way. In many ways, these companies are more like gods to us than our own religion. The way Apple, Amazon, Nestle, and the other six fucking companies left exist in this world is essential as overlords. They could not give less of a fuck about their consumers or employees, but they expect absolutely everything out of those that serve them. Both from employees and consumers alike. Amazon literally forces its employees to piss and shit in bottles to keep on schedule. Drug prices are so high that individuals have to give more than everything just to stay alive. It‚Äôs literally everything‚Ä¶


So naturally, I began thinking about politics and those that ‚Äúrun‚Äù our society and thought, I wonder why they haven‚Äôt done anything about this. These people that claim to care about us/our interests and run our cities are more concerned with their insider stock trades and getting reelected than they are with helping those that live within our districts. There are two parties left in this country, ten companies left, and everyone hates each other over the dumbest shit I have ever seen. Maybe it is just easier to control us this way. I'm not entirely sure. All I know is that we have become slaves to our own society, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. Everyone just seems to be angry and chasing a better life with absolutely no means of changing it. I know that things have always been this way, but I just wish they weren‚Äôt. I want to use my life to help change these things. There is just so much that's fucked up. I believe that until everyone wakes up to what is going on around us, we will be enslaved for the foreseeable future.¬†

Capitalism treats everyone like shit but women get criminalized and targeted especially for unpaid exploitation under capitalism. Fuck capitalism and how it makes women‚Äôs bodies feed it. Get that fucking IUD ladies.

A baby is a shackle and a chain in America.  The state uses babies and families to exploit and control women and female bodies of childbearing age. The state will use the threat of abusing your babies in foster care to control and exploit you and keep you in poverty, rather than make child care an institution.  I love kids but I doubt I could look at mine without also seeing it for what I didn‚Äôt make it to be: a weapon of the state. A tool to keep me in my job. And if I did object, a tool to criminalize me as an unfit mother. Even if I kept them fed. 

The white boomer 70s feminist agenda of ‚Äúwomen in the workplace‚Äù didn‚Äôt help families prosper except for a small group of Reagan-era ‚Äúgirl bosses,‚Äùit made working women poorer because it gave an influx of underpaid labor to shitty service jobs and Reagan era feminism did NOT follow through. It‚Äôs gains were  concentrated  to rich white women. The rest of us got Reagan era union busting and over policing and drug influxes and service jobs. Those jobs don‚Äôt have benefits or child care. They are worthless drains of time. And surprise!  The white feminists didn‚Äôt care, they made bank from male lies sold to them as they all pretended they were Murphy Brown or some shit. And their legacy is what I have to deal with: some broke dropout from DeVry telling me the religious daycare she runs for her mom is a ‚Äúfemale place of empowerment‚Äù because ‚Äúshe hires so many women,‚Äù as she underpays them all and cuts time because she‚Äôs the only bitch who controls the time clock, and they all go to the same run down church. And then she gets an audit and cries for Jesus. Like Jesus will save your ass, bitch your husband paid for your Maserati.

Fuck your lean in, girl boss, white college bullshit. Fuck it right in its bleached asshole. I don‚Äôt have the time or money for drinks at the club discussing ‚Äúsalary.‚Äù You are not a feminist, you are a capitalist using feminist language to dismiss the needs of others.

So I‚Äôve seen up close, the shitty things management and labour do to each other while the customers finish up the trifecta in a 3 way knife fight. 

All of that aside, no matter what, there were rules and any worker could, if not a lot else, expect to be treated fairly and equally by the company. The only difference is your seniority date when it‚Äôs time to crew.

spr2uu,My quitting story.,6,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spr2uu/my_quitting_story/,3,"I'm not sure if this fits here, but it has been a year, and I would like to share my quitting story. It isn't super exciting, but I would still like to share, and there isn't very much dialogue. I was working at a chain chicken fast food restaurant that is only in the south east of the US that is known for being waaay to expensive for fast food, though they have pretty dope salads.

Last year, the Wednesday before Easter 2021, I was in a single vehicle car accident, and long story short, I did some permanent damage to my shoulder (for those of you who may be curious, I severed the tendons in the shoulder of my dominant arm, though I am better, it still is in a lot of pain and I still have to do PT). I was in a sling for about 2 to 2.5 months, but about a month after my accident, I quit. I was an assistant manager. It wasn't 100% because of the injury that I quit, but it was a large contributing factor. 

The people involved are Cathy the Store Manager, John the District Manager, Sally another assistant manager, and Nate my roommate and an employee. Also Sally started having it out for me after I officially became a manager after completing my training, I'm guessing because I was hired on as a manager in training due to previous management experience and age (she was 19 and I was, at the time, 27) instead of working my way up, but I have no idea if that is really why. She targeted me, and tried to write me up after my accident for things like not lifting High-Fructose Corn Syrup boxes (40-50lbs, I had a weight limitation of 5lbs) for the soda machine or only working in the Front of House and not in the Back of House because I was under strict limitations from the ER doctors due to my injury. Sally was the same level as me and Cathy told her multiple times that she was not able to write me up as she was not my boss, and she couldn't write me up because of not doing things I was not able to do under the limitations I had on me anyway, as that could cause litigation.

So, a few weeks after the accident, I had a doctors appointment so my car insurance could help out with my medical bills. This was the only appointment I was able to get before I was no longer able to finish filing my claim but to too much time having passed. Not a lot of doctors offices in my area, at the time, were accepting new patients, and a lot of them still had strict limitations on occupancy and appointments. I was going to drop off Nate at work, as he went in 3 hours before me, then I was going to go to my appointment then head to work. Sally messaged me while I was about to leave to ask me to come in early as she wanted to leave early, in her fist text she didn't tell me why she wanted to leave early. I told her no, and that as soon as I was done dropping off Nate, I had somewhere I needed to be and it was important. She then sent me three other texts, that I didn't answer as I was driving at that point and then she called me and kept repeating that I needed to come in early as she needed to take her car to a mechanic or she was going to wreck and die, which was an over exaggeration, in my opinion (she would have left at 3 PM, more than enough time to get to a mechanic, and it wasn't that she scheduled an appointment, because I heard from her roommates later that she just brought it in as a walk in.). I refused her three times in that call and she reused to drop it, so I snapped at her that I'll be in at 2 and hung up. My appointment was at 1, and it was a 30 min drive from the doctors office, so I had to miss my appointment. When I got in at 2, she was all happy and laughing, and I just couldn't control it, I went off at her. I told her that thanks to her, I will be stuck with this medical debt as I couldn't afford the bills without the help of my insurance, and they weren't going to offer me an extension, and that when I refused multiple times she should have dropped it, and I told her to just leave, as I didn't want to look at her. I messaged Cathy and told her that I was going to quit as I couldn't stand Sally's blatant disregard for my medical needs, and that I was done. Well Cathy told me that she set up a meeting with her and John to address the issue (why this wasn't done before, I have no idea, because I complained multiple times about the medical violations against me Sally was doing.) and I told her that I will stay until the meeting, and if things weren't addressed in a proper manner, I was leaving that day and not coming back. This was on a Friday, the meeting was scheduled for Tuesday. Well, the next day when I came in, I was looking at the manager logbook, and I saw some vile and rude things written about me in there from Sally, and that was the last straw, we were super busy and Sally kept telling me to go up to the FOH while I was writing to Cathy. Sally kept saying that they needed me up there, and right before I clocked out and left, I said, and I'll never forget this because of the feeling I had when I said it, ""They don't need me anywhere, I'm sick of your shit, so I am leaving.""

I am sad I had to leave that job, because I really enjoyed working there other than that one manager. I got a new job two weeks later in an industry I had never worked before, and I adore this job as well. I will have been in this new position for a year in May.

I've been back to that place twice, once when Sally wasn't working to get an order of fries, because they have really good fries, and earlier today to get my W2. Sally was there, and I went through the drive thru to get some fries after finishing up my taxes in the parking lot on my phone. She was talking trash about me where I could clearly hear her through the window. I, honestly, have only thought about her three times since I quit, the two times I went to that restaurant, and now, writing this post, but it is nice to see that I still piss her off, I hope what she did to me happens to her one day.",1644556001.0

He was fired up and screaming and said he wants to make national news for our super bowl displays. 

First we built a massive replica of the super bowl stadium out of cans of refried beans. It's right there as you walk into the store and looks stupid as fuck. Had a few of the younger stockboys help, they said it was like playing Minecraft. I didn't get to leave until 2 am. We also built a Dr. Pepper fanzone out of crates of soda. Basically a big sports castle. There are even flatscreen TVs in there. I happened to check it the next day and saw a homeless guy jacking off.

We even put artificial turf down in all the aisles. It was used and we got it free from some local high school that replaced their field. It looks awful and those little black pieces of rubber are now everywhere.

Saturday he has an elaborate celebration planned with some retired Bengal and a marching band. I have already called in sick. He has been emailing ""tips"" about our display to local news stations using all sorts of made up identities but so far none of them have cared.

sq0j53,Training and Development,1,0.67,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sq0j53/training_and_development/,0,"Good Morning,

I have been an instructional designer at a financial company for almost two years now. In that time we have cycled through 7 IDs and 6 facilitators.

I just had a conversation with my boss because I explained that there has been a significant breakdown in our processes and as much of a proponent for ""not being order-takers"" we have consistently been told, ""just get it done"".

Regardless of the fact that we are regularly hindered to do our job to the fullest. The company has weekly office meetings to show us all how many billions, yes b-billions of dollars just one section of our company makes in a month. (granted they don't give a whole lot of detail ie how we did last year, etc)

Anyway, myself and the other IDs noticed how our pay was severely reduced from the industry standards, more so now because of the nature of training and development as an industry. So I asked my boss for a 15% raise to get me to the low end of the industry average (85k - 120k currently make 73k).

She informed me that my raise a year and a half ago (asked for 5%) she fought tooth and nail (supposedly) for me to get a 3.5% raise. So it didn't fill me with confidence. So I explained that her boss can either pay us what we are valued at, or we will keep jumping ship and they will need to hire and retrain new people.

There are many issues at the company outside of the monatary issues; the company still not understanding what my team does or can be used for (she has not done anything to really help the company understand that, as far as I know)

TLDR
Corporate training as an instructional designer is a creative and fulfilling industry to be a part of, with skills that can be easily adapted over to other industries, web design, UX design, tech dev, video production, marketing, etc

Base salary for an instructional designer ranges from 65k - 120k easily. You can also find hundreds of remote ID positions, so if you're interested look for positions and ask for whatever you want. Companies are desperate to fix their shitty processes and training and some of them are paying adequately. Just look out for Healthcare or medical companies as they are churning and burning IDs frsh out of college.",1644589278.0

""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me: I lift my lamp beside the golden door."" -   Emma Lazarus

The exploitation of desperate disadvantaged people to harvest the ""surplus value"" of their labour by a class of people who's ancestors had material wealth bestowed to them is gentrified capitalism. In the case of the US, tory landowners from Britain sold their bestowed possessions to pay for passage to the new world along with an indentured workforce who built plantations which in combination with slavery, guaranteed an income that allowed them to more than meet the cost of living and education. 

It also allowed for the exchange of wealth for other forms of guaranteed income like government contracts, bonds or rental properties which increases their income exponentially but causes today's various inequalities, economic deficiencies and fallacies.

 

Merit based capitalism is about equality, efficacy and sustainability, which is fundamentally tied to democratic principles and requires some form of system to allow all people to access higher education and join the market on equal footing at least with regards to qualifications.

This system allows intelligent, talented and meritorious people access to positions which is more effective than people who just have qualifications because the concept of going to a posh school equating to its allumni having automatic merit is an association fallacy, modern education exists to supplement natural ability not recognise it and is tied to the fallacious justification of the continued enriching of the autocratic complex, representative democracy requires you to act in the interests of the people not getting away with autocratic interest on a technicality.

I watched an interview of a American ""economist"" complaining that people didn't understand budget deficiency and expecting the government to pay was an ignorant position but what he clearly didn't understand was that the gentry who own inherited wealth are a bad investment. The idea that the ceaseless subsidising and bailing out of people/institutions who are ""too big to fail"" is just as fiscally irresponsible. 

The systems ability to misconstrue enabling merit with tropes (discrimination, denial of individual reward etc.) to scare people is so infuriating because it works so well and throughout history has made progress very slow. but if anyone actually made a comparison between great achievers and the gentry rather than the destitute, they would see there is no contest. but any sort of rational debate is impossible because you have to overcome misinformation, slander and pre-emotive hypocrisy at the start before you can even make the point but this is the defence mechanism to anything that is perceived as a threat the system.

I dont see a way forward as people are alienated by tyranny yet advancements in technology and organisation means we have never been in this situation before, if the instruments of honour, wealth and authority continue to exist solely to maintain the distinction between the classes all of history would point to an inevitable collapse.",1644587201.0

Past History: about 23 jobs that I've bothered to track; general labor, retail, military (army/air force ROTC), office desk (once was a temporary transcriptionist for the CEO of AccuWeather, tank top and chewing tobacco amongst cubicles of suits and business skirts was a unique experience), customer service, outdoor adventuring (think high ropes courses), and a few under the table jobs, hello bouncer community. 

With all that out of the way, what's wrong with sleeping at work? 

Nobody, except perhaps one of the former mods of this sub, haha meta joke, will argue that sleeping at a work place and ignoring work that needs or should be done is a good thing. 

Also nobody will argue that they should be able to sleep at a job that requires their constant attention, like food service workers when they're on the line, or retail workers in a busy store.

Also nobody will argue that they should be able to sleep when their job requires them to be on call or otherwise alert and ready. 

Also nobody will argue that they should be able to sleep when it's fucking go time and I nor anybody else gives a shit if you're tired. Here's the military attitude, but don't be so hard on yourselves. I got mad respect for the boss lady who hounded my ass and wouldn't let me slack to hurry up and get a large shipment put away by the end of the day so no one had to work extra tomorrow, because that would really suck for whoever it fell to.

But people will argue that they should be able to take a power nap during their 15min or lunch break. You're clocked out anyway, but you still get yelled at.

But people will argue that they should be able to go lie down for a bit because their feet are killing them in this warehouse job and we won't get any more orders for another hour so why do we have to continue standing around doing jack shit?

But people will argue that they're on this job as a part of a team, and if something happens just punch my sleeping arm and I'll be there, but no that's way too much to ask of your coworkers.

I personally am arguing that I should be able to sleep at my job. I can confidently say that there are periods of one or two hours where there is nothing that needs to be done. There's always something to find of course, it's one of those work places, but nothing will blow up or catch fire if I don't exist for an hour. I work either by myself or with two others. I never sleep when I'm alone, but if I'm capable of waking up to the alarms on my phone at home, or with coworkers, I think I'm capable of doing that when I'm alone. I always inform my coworkers that I'm going on break, do they mind if I take a nap. They say no, but apparently they do, they took pictures, because I wasn't hiding, and waited for a social reason (3 weeks after) to send it to the boss. And I got written up.

So why are we doing all this arguing? Well, sleep is a very important component of health. Kinda need to do it like 6-8hrs a day to maintain. Yeah yeah I've been there where you get like 20hrs of sleep in 7 days, for years, and you crush caffine like it's your job, but that obviously ain't healthy long term, and going through it kinda really sucks. But also naps are pretty fucking great. Just chewed over a really complicated problem for half the day and your brain is mush? 15min power nap. Just hauled ass like a champ and moved like two pallets of 50lbs chemical bags and you can barely raise your arms? Stretch that shit, drink some water, and go lie down for 30min. From the individual perspective, you feel better and happier because you're not suffering, and from the company perspective their happy because it has been shown, and it makes common sense, that happy and healthy people do more work of a better quality. 

But no. People who sleep at work are lazy bums who should be fired. Nah actually, they're probably just struggling. I work night shift, I work 12hr shifts, and I simply don't have the energy or time to properly maintain social relationships with day walkers, and to wait for businesses to open and do my business, and care for my cats (fucking cute ass fluffy toddlers who constantly need attention), and cook and clean my apartment and try to have hobbies like building cat towers or drawing and showering and all the things we do in our domiciles, and sleep. I don't have time at home, and the thing I have most control over, that only affects me, is my sleep. So I cut it out. But anyone who has been severely sleep deprived for a long time knows how it feels when you start becoming less of a person. No sleep, no energy, no fun, no positive, only sleeping through your alarms, only making dumb mistakes that get you written up or fired, only being able to do the bare minimum so of course you never get promoted or advanced, only failing to follow through on promises to do things, only feeling shitty and suffering. It takes awhile to get to that point, but every day of not enough sleep you can feel your own self slipping.

And that's why, when we are able to, when it is appropriate, without being judged, because it is judgment that fires people and puts them on the street, people will argue that they should be able to sleep at work.

And then the other day, I looked more into my reports...

I can now see that one of the reasons my future applications for credit can be denied is due to me having outstanding loan balances. That reasoning was not listed when I last checked.

But I don't have outstanding loan balances. My student loans are deferred and all of my other debts on the reports are paid off. No other loans are listed.

I am currently in the process of correcting this. And I don't want sympathy, I just want as many people as possible to know about this. I knew loan servicers are predatory, but this is a new low from my personal experience. This is frustrating, but can I truly be surprised at this point?

And also, as I was just wrapping up this post draft, apparently my loans are not on deferment anymore. I just looked and they're actually on forbearance now. Which means that my loans have been accruing interest for a while.

Loans are only supposed to be paid back once a person graduates and is hired for employment, which I'm working on. I've never been hired for a full-time job yet my loans switched from deferment to forbearance. Yeah, that's a problem

Needless to say, I'll be contacting my loan servicer tomorrow. I'll update this post about the situation whenever I figure things out.

Check those reports!",1644548899.0

The minimum wage is being raised by $1.20 an hour to $21.20 from the start of April, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today.

Amid rising complaints from businesses that they will have less than two months to prepare for the increase, the Government announced the changes this morning.

""Many Kiwis who earn the minimum wage have gone above and beyond in our fight against COVID-19. We remain committed to supporting New Zealanders by raising their wages, as we continue to recover and rebuild from the pandemic,"" Wood said in a statement.

""Raising the minimum wage will directly benefit approximately 300,000 workers, and will help many households that have been most impacted by the effects of COVID.

The starting-out and training minimum wage will also increase from $16 to $16.96 per hour from 1 April 2022, Wood said.

Council of Trade Unions (CTU) president Richard Wagstaff welcomed the news.

""**The CTU believes that increases in the Minimum Wage are both essential and desirable. Unemployment is at record low levels**. Employers primary concern in surveys is their inability to access labour. **There has never been a better time to increase the minimum wage**. Despite suggestions to the contrary, international and New Zealand evidence suggests that increasing the minimum wage does not increase unemployment.""",1644526533.0

spoiop,Pay Me Less My Guy,5,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spoiop/pay_me_less_my_guy/,0,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

So I was finishing up college in the midwest. It was the spring semester of 2020 and I had accepted a position with a company of a couple hundred people in a small town in the middle of nowhere, hours away from where I was currently living. I asked for compensation slightly above average for grads from my college program. I had pretty good grades and internship experience . I ended up agreeing on $1k less than the average. A month later COVID hits and I get told I would be placed on hiring freeze until August. Alright, I guess just something I‚Äôll have to live with. Well the beginning of June rolls around and I get called and asked if I could start at the beginning of July. But they need me to take a 10% pay cut through the end of the year. The one question I ask, ‚ÄúIs everyone in the company taking a pay cut?‚Äù. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù is the reply from my potential boss on the other end of the line. I think, if everyone is doing it then I guess I can live with it. What else was a guy to do? The job market was completely dead and the outlook of finding another job anytime soon was bleak.

Fast forward to getting hired. I get presented with a new job contract with my new pay and told to sign. I look and the pay cut isn‚Äôt quite 10%. It‚Äôs rounded to the nearest thousand. I begin to think something is fishy, but I sign the contract. I start training and all seems fine and once I start to meet a few new coworkers I get comfortable enough with them to start poking around. ‚ÄúHow have things been here since Covid? Any negative impacts on the business?‚Äù I find out they laid off a bunch of people right when it had started, but am told that COVID was probably used as a guise to fire people that weren‚Äôt great workers or didn‚Äôt fit well with the company. Interesting. No mention of pay cuts though. The next day I get worked up enough to ask one of my coworkers I was starting to become friends with about pay cuts point blank. ‚ÄúWhat pay cuts?‚Äù Is the response I receive. I then explain to him how I‚Äôm getting fucked over. He then tells me about how he was one of the people who were laid off. And they brought him back in different position.

I finish my job training the rest of the week without mentioning anything again to anyone and start in my new position while trying to figure out if saying anything to my boss will do anything to benefit me. He lied to my face before I ever started. Why would he have any moral compass to make things right? And although my blood is boiling and I want to quit this job immediately but I‚Äôm hesitant. I mean what sort of future do you really have with a company that‚Äôs going to do whatever is in their best interest and doesn‚Äôt mind if they have to fuck you to do it? But Covid is a thing and the job market is still dead. And no one wants to hire a college grad with two weeks of experience so where am I going to go? So I stay in my job and vow to never do more than the bare minimum job requirement for this company.

As far as my job goes it completely sucks and I dread coming to work every day. It is nothing like what my expectations were and the work is mind numbingly shit. I‚Äôm not working on half the stuff I was told I would be either. Mind you it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve moved to a new town where I know nobody. My 2 year girlfriend and I broke up prior to the move. And any opportunity for meeting people is nonexistent with Covid in full effect. Oh and not to mention I‚Äôm living in a hotel until I find a spot to live. I stop looking for apartments though the minute I learn I‚Äôm being lied to because I refuse to have anything keeping me at this shit job. I let this be the state of my life for far too long and end up living in the hotel for seven months basically in a state of depression the whole time suffering through the shit job. 

Then the end of the year comes. At my end of the year review I get bumped back up to my pay I was suppose to receive when I started. I find out my job will be changing drastically and I see this as a big time positive. I actually start to not dread coming to work. I decide to give the job a chance for another year and commit to the town and job. I get an apartment and life starts to seem better. But it‚Äôs always in the back of my head. They lied to me and fucked me over so why put much effort into my work? Why meet their deadlines? I lose any motivation to develop in my career because I don‚Äôt want the company to benefit from it.

I see them fuck over many people while I‚Äôm there for the year and a half. They try to get the only HR person in the company for the last 8 years to take a 5 digit pay cut because they hired someone over her to run the department. She was smart enough to give them the bird and find a new job. I watched them give a management position to someone within the company who gets trained in and works the position for three months only to have the higher ups change their minds not long after. I watch them fire a guy two weeks before Christmas because they don‚Äôt want to pay him any of the time he‚Äôd be off. Nonstop turnover at certain positions and job postings that are open for months because the company won‚Äôt raise their pay rates. Not to mention horrible benefits. And a lot of people who work here don‚Äôt care about their job because most people are looking to get out. But it‚Äôs a small town and there aren‚Äôt many opportunities nearby.

Fast forward to the end of 2021. Time for my end of the year review. My boss tells me everything has been good. My works been good. They‚Äôre happy with my progress. They hand me a sheet to show me my new salary. It‚Äôs a 4.7% raise... the equivalent of core inflation for the year. I get told I‚Äôm getting a $1500 bonus to bring my salary up to where it should have been for the past year (because of the company not reaching profit sharing goals.) I tell him I‚Äôm not happy with that. I let them know I‚Äôm being paid less than the average college grad from my school would be projected to be making and I‚Äôve been working there for a year and a half. You‚Äôre happy with the work I‚Äôve done so I think I should be making a little more than the next warm body that walks through the door. I also let my boss know I‚Äôm aware that I was lied to. My boss wants to talk with upper management and get back to me.

My boss sets up a meeting a couple days later and leads off asking me how long I‚Äôve known they lied to me. Then tells me it doesn‚Äôt help anyone to be resentful for the year and half I‚Äôve worked there. Deflects blame onto upper management although the words came from my bosses mouth and then goes back to pretending nothing ever happened. They then slide me my new salary offer. They decided to take away my bonus and add $2k to the salary. Basically the equivalent of telling me to go fuck myself. Then tells me I haven‚Äôt been developing as well as they thought I‚Äôd be, contradicting everything they said in my initial meeting. My boss then has the audacity to tell me I received a big raise of 11% the previous year and asks if I‚Äôm expecting double digit raises every year. I also get fed the line that they gave everyone around the same percentage raise and that my boss considers us all equal in the department. Also try‚Äôs to say profit sharing is part of my salary even though it‚Äôs not guaranteed money as was proven that previous year by receiving nothing for three quarters. Also tells me I shouldn‚Äôt be making a certain amount of money because they had to work 7 years before making that amount of money. My boss obviously has zero grasp on the concept of inflation. 

 For the last month I have given less fucks than ever at that job. I have no incentive to work hard because ‚Äúeveryone gets treated equal in our department‚Äù.  Currently on pace to miss a month long deadline by at least a week. I can‚Äôt get past the fact I‚Äôm getting fucked repeatedly. I‚Äôm tired of showing up everyday and not giving a single fuck about what I do. The job search has begun but no matter what I‚Äôm getting out of this toxic shit hole when my lease is up in a couple months. 

Thought I‚Äôd share and let everyone know always do what‚Äôs best for you. Employers will fuck you the second they get the chance. And don‚Äôt stick with a company that doesn‚Äôt respect you. I would have rather been out of work since the beginning of covid than turned into the nihilistic prick I‚Äôve become because of this company and the asshats who manage it.

TLDR: My dumbass decides to inflict mental torture on myself for a year and a half by not leaving a job when I‚Äôm lied to before ever starting. Management proves if they screw you once they‚Äôll keep screwing you.

Perhaps it's warranted to be frustrated with someone.  Perhaps there are issues that are happening to you personally, or professionally.  If we remember to treat each other well then most of what gets complained about here doesn't happen.
This subreddit would be a lot less popular with people treated others with respect, work hard and be there when you need or are needed to be.

Of course things come up the prevent our work ethic from being on point or prevent us from being on time, but that's where the respect comes in.

Whatever your job is, if your superior treats you with dignity and respect and you return that by working hard and being on time... Then the only thing we have left to complain about is our rates of pay and perhaps a few bad customer service experiences.

Last week i had to call in due to the passing of my bosses father. I called in over 36+ hours before my shift. My boss for the concert company asked if I could run everything while he is gone. I wouldn't say no as that would have put us behind since we had three days of good weather in a row. 

The boss at my part time job said alright my shift was covered. Sunday The day of my ""covered"" shift she called me asking if i could come in. Luckily I rearranged my schedule and my schedule to make it work. All while im doing the job of 3 people for my full time job. 

Monday rolls around and the part time boss is sick and same with Tuesday. Wednesday she leaves early and she doesn't care that my boyfriend is sick at work but makes him stay. Today rolls around still my boyfriend is sick. He woke up getting sick and having restroom issues. 

He talked to the boss and she said he cant close early and has to come in. He closes at midnight by himself, he asked to close at 10 considering its not really busy after 8:30. I think he might have covid with all his symptoms but problem is he has already been in contact with lots of people.

He is getting tested tomorrow. I told him to put his two weeks in. We were around other employees as i said this. Fun y enough the other two employees have interviews in the next few days. 

Is there anything he should do to protect himself if he does have covid and knowingly worked while not feeling good. Even though he told the boss about it the first day?

My experience: I've been dealing with chronic suicidal thoughts ever since I was a child, and I'm currently relapsing pretty fucking hard. Two weeks ago though, I got a diagnosis of COVID and I was in literally a world of pain. I couldn't breath, I had a fever, my head was pounding, I vomited blood I think. It was fucking wild and honestly like I came this close to get hospitalized.

But I remember thinking: that's nice I don't have to go to work.

And  for once in my life, I was free of suicidal thoughts. I didn't have any. I have some feelings of death ideation like oh yeah I could die from this, this is nice, but.... I wasn't suicidal.

I came back to work today, and I was struck, and I mean hit by a truck, with suicidal thoughts. For three hours straight, I was crying, sobbing and I was unable to move because of how sad and miserable I was. I left and I don't think I'm coming back.

There are three of us who run the place - Jim is my uncle, who is supposed t be our manager. Len is a family friend. 

Jim is a very selfish conversationalist and absolutely dominates any conversation he walks into, uninvited or not. The running joke is that Jim can here people talking from up to 5 miles away and can travel at light speed to said conversation and immediately start a full on TED talk. Jim will often take a break during work and sit and tell stories about how awesome he is, how everyone loves him, he saves the day in every story. His stories can melt into each other and before you know it, he‚Äôs been talking for over an hour. Sometimes he does this at the end of the day and talks until it‚Äôs time to leave. 

Len kind of just goes along with whatever Jim does or says and is basically his ‚Äúyes man‚Äù. Len is also terribly unorganized and will often sit down in a chair and fall asleep at work. He makes stupid mistakes that cost us a lot of money and time, and forgets important tasks. 

Both Jim and Len are of the older generation that believes you should work yourself to the bone, never ask for a raise, and be satisfied with an ‚Äúattaboy‚Äù for being such a dedicated worker. They live to work. 

The typical work day goes as follows: work begins at 8:00. I arrive on site sometimes a little early, sometimes right at 8. Jim and Len sometimes arrive on time, but often are 30 min to a few hours late. 

Jim sits down and starts talking about how he saved the day at the bowling alley last night and his personal life with his wife and terrible in-laws. Typically about 30 min to an hour of talking and standing around. Len is cool with this, but I just I usually duck out and start work right away. I do all I can to avoid story time with Jim. 

Len and I work together a lot, and he seems to want to take the wheel on projects since he has more experience and seniority than I do, which is fine. But he has a hard time working in an efficient way and moves slow and slacks off a lot. He will forget tools or supplies for the task at other locations and constantly driving back and forth looking for the things he has lost. 

I typically just want to work the entire time. I don‚Äôt want to sit down and chat. I don‚Äôt want an hour long lunch. I just want to do my job and go home. I‚Äôm not there to hang out. 

Lately, they have been talking about hiring in another person because we just can‚Äôt seem to stay caught up with our work. The problem with this is a pay decrease if we hire another person. Their pay would have to come from our pot (we are paid a certain percentage of profits). It has to be a unanimous vote, and I‚Äôm holding it up. We don‚Äôt need another lazy worker for Jim to dazzle with his stories of olde. We need to be more efficient with our work. 

Our work days could be cut in almost half, if we just did our fucking jobs. Yesterday, Len and I were assigned to a task that was expected to take 2 days. Len stated to do his stupid shit where hI starts one thing before finishing another, leaving messes for me to clean up. I was keeping my head down and just work work working. He stopped and said what‚Äôs the rush? Why are you working so fast, we are going to be here for two days. I got pissed and I said I would like to just finish the job and go home. He bet me actual money we couldn‚Äôt get it done in one day, and he agreed to let me lead. Well guess what? Under my leadership, we finished our task, PLUS another one, AND GOT DONE AN HOUR EARLY. 

Guess who gets to have another early day today since we completed our task ahead of schedule yesterday? Plus, I won the bet. 

So how do I convince these old fuckers that if we just do our jobs, we could spend more time at home, more time with our families, we can go on vacations and have fridays off. We don‚Äôt have to work a 40+ hour week. 

Please help me, I‚Äôm so close to working less and getting paid more. I‚Äôm so close!!",1644579124.0

&#x200B;

Preliminary definition: an authentic human work is *the effort consented to produce or create, in order to realize a project fulfilling the person who carries it out.*

If work is not this consented effort, but a *forced* act, it becomes violence, constraint. 

If work realizes *a project alien to the person who performs it*, it becomes dispossession of his act, alienation from himself. 

If work does not develop a disposition, a talent, a potentiality of the one who performs it, it becomes *withering, atrophy.*

In inauthentic work as defined here, which forms *the immense mass of work done on earth*, the individual is asked *to stay in the checkroom*: in fact, what is done generally involves only his organs such as the hand or the brain. *Organs that are no longer his*, but belong to the production process that is foreign to him.

Individuals not being (or not yet) robots, the authentic personality (or what remains of it) can be partially *allowed to express itself superficially*, in a decorative way, but the individual must above all equip himself *with the behaviors adapted to his function*: an automatic smile, a bow, an agreed upon speech.

The priority that enslaves the human activity of the vast majority is of course *the insane* profit of a few.

To emancipate oneself from inauthentic work consists in making the blossoming of the dispositions, talents and potentialities of each and everyone a universal priority.",1644556963.0

It seemed to be a welcoming, low-stress environment providing outpatient services / procedures. It was exciting for me to learn about a new field and be able to interact with patients directly, and I thought it was a good fit. At first.

A disconnect began when verbal abuse by one or more long time employees, despite my best attempts to adhere to protocol, became a frequent occurrence. Basically, I got praise from multiple patients for treating them like actual human beings instead of just numbers to be reported. 

My manager and senior staff weren't happy about it. Most of the clients are elderly and need extra time with most physical tasks, and the patients would express surprise and ""how professional I was"" that I'd give them a few extra minutes by just being kind. But I was told I spend too much time making the patients feel comfortable, and that was unacceptable. Apparently all that matters to this business is minimizing wait times and maximizing the amount of patients pumped thru their doors even during times of COVID restrictions when numbers should be limited in a medical practice.

Genuinely all I wanted to do was a good job.

First Thursday rolls around and my manager asks me if I want to work on Friday, I say no and he says you should expect to work every Friday for the next two months at least.

On what was to be my last day, we are wrapping up a Wednesday when the owner, as he walks out, tells the manager that we have to stay until everything is done (about 2 hours more work) and we have to wait around for a new shipment to arrive before we can even get started (being vague on purpose to not implicate things...).

Turns out not a single employee has worked at the company for longer than one year and they all told me stories of being verbally harassed by the owner.

First off, many thanks to all who commented, gave me encouragement, and schooled me in the term constructive termination. I wrote my boss an email later that day and quit. She was not surprised, and was not planning on rehiring for my position. Knowing that I had a bit of a landing pad through unemployment was really huge. I had been thinking of changing career fields for a while now, and it encouraged me to apply to a couple of graduate programs doing something that I think is positive for the world and people, versus what I was doing, which was wringing money from local businesses to line my boss's pocket.

There were many questions about base pay vs commission. For anyone who's worked in sales, the base pay is usually a fraction of what you normally make overall. This is what I was expecting when I was recruited last year to do this job. In reality, the boss lady kept cancelling magazine issues (I sold advertising) after I had sold into them, which lost me money and clients. The base pay was just enough to cover my kids' childcare and allow me to break even. The commission would have been what I made on top of that. So, after the email that she sent me that cut my base pay in half (and said she would cut that in half again the month after), I was also seeing emails about her cancelling more issues. This was a poor business plan on her behalf; her competitor across town (and ex-business partner) was doing the opposite and increasing distribution and continuing to publish. Ex-partner was KILLING IT and taking all our business, while my boss was freaking out. In a company of 8 people, 5 (including me) had quit in the past 8 months.

 When I took this job, I signed my kids up for childcare, which meant a 10% nonrefundable deposit and a contract through the end of this June. So, within one month, I knew that not only would I be making substantially less, I also would no longer be making enough to even cover childcare, let alone my bills. I couldn't get out of the contract, so I really felt like my boss had screwed me over pretty hard.

Unemployment will be substantially less than what I make, but will still cover childcare while I change gears and get out of the cycle of work/spend and make a living doing something that's actually net beneficial for our society and environment.",1644524578.0

I think at that point, even they knew how ridiculous it was getting. And my boss at the job I was trying to leave thought there was something seriously wrong with my health, given the seven ""doctor's appointments"" I had to leave the office for (pre-pandemic) in the span of two months.

The real kicker is that they \*did\* end up offering me the job in the end ... for $20K less than asking. Leveraged it for a raise in my current position and honestly, it felt amazing to give the other company a hard ""no"" after what they put me through.

I'm a landscape designer, basically all I do is draw on my iPad and create nice little illustrations that depict the species and arrangement, etc. to help close the deal on a landscaping job. I do a lot of work from home to try and meet deadlines. I am very new, and so the first week I really wasn't going to push it about getting every single hour, as I didn't wanna risk pissing my boss off and most of it was experimentation and playing around on the iPad, figuring out the process.

But now, I find I'm still doing a lot of work from home (about 5 hours most weeks). I got COVID a while back and worked from home, texted my boss about how to log my hours and told him how much I worked and he said ""talk with me tomorrow"". I forgot to and have just been hesitant. Paycheck came and my home hours weren't logged. And today he has me working from home to finish a job before tomorrow. I texted him and asked him again, since I neglected to meet with him about it, once again he said ""get with me tomorrow"".

I'm getting strong vibes that he is not down with it, since it requires trusting the employee to be honest about the hours. How should I prepare for this? I am *not* going to continue to work from home if he flat out refuses to ever pay me for it but I worry this could piss him off. He's a workaholic and a stern guy, although he is pleasant and likes me for the most part. I greatly improved their designs since I've been drawing for years. He is very pleased with my work and I've became the main designer in just a month of working there. I don't mind finishing something up here and there for 30 min or so, but if he is specifically asking me to do multiple hours of work, as a busy ass engineering student, that is a sacrifice and I expect to get paid.

How can I make this happen while avoiding any unpleasant situations? I want to approach this right, I'm a bit of a passive guy",1644544215.0

Tesco = supermarket chain

Assistant Manager works secondary to the general manager, AM spends most time in the ""trenches"" GM remains in office mostly all the time. (I had this job may 2020 - August 2020, COVID first hit the news majorly) 

Idk if this has happened to anywhere else but the AM unironicaly ran the store like a branch of the army: referred to himself as the ""commanding officer"" and ""first officer"" multiple times, demanded we referred to him as ""sir"" or ""captain"" (not a single person ever used that one), he wanted us to kinda stand at attention when he passes us or walked into the room, he renamed the things we did as part of our job as ""orders"" or ""commands"" or ""duties"", we had a briefing every shift change which left the entire store empty of staff meaning the store stood still for about 30 mins where he would throw his weight around (one briefing he called my shift ""soldiers"") and tell us how he has received ""orders"" from ""central command"" ( the GM) before then giving us our ""orders"" being moved to different sections was labelled ""redeployment"" and called the backrooms where the office was ""ground control"". He would spend what seemed like 50% of his time standing and berating us all for ""disobeying a DIRECT order"". 

Worst part was, a lot of staff went along with this - called him sir, did the stand to attention thing, didn't piss themselves laughing when he shouted at them. 

I have a ton of stories from this job if you want them but this is just an introduction to this guy.

Edit: the AM called it ""the trenches""

Hiring parties: do you find it a waste of time to review and interview candidates who might not have applied if given this information?

1. i don't need the job; in fact i kept my old job at my prior clinic in case my new job was bad (the reason i looked for a new job is bc this one is far away and pay is sad but the manager and coworkers are great and it's not toxic at all)
2. i got an interview for an emergency clinic that will pay more and is no way gonna have all these red flags.

so i worked a single shift on monday and am currently scheduled to work 2 more next week. the question is how do i tell them i quit? obviously i can just say i quit but i guess bc i have to go back and get my check i don't want to be super rude or anything. how can i quit w/o being adversarial ?? i know i'm easily replaceable so i don't feel loyalty but for some reason feel guilty not giving them some notice (even tho my first day was monday this week) just wanna get my money for my time and move on tbh

red flags at the place:

1. the only place i have ever worked that still does paper records only (huge waste of paper and time seriously)- it tells me theyre not willing to adapt and change even when it's more efficient
2. don't change needles after drawing up vaccines and then giving the vaccine- the only place out of the 5 clinics i've worked at that doesn't change needles
3. idk why but the paper checks thing bc none of my jobs has done paper checks ONLY and no option for direct deposit at all
4. the way the main dvm/owner talks to ppl is so condescending and rude; instead of being like hey this is how we do it here she's like its so inefficient why didn't u think to do it like that even though its ur first day; plus she was super rude to another tech when the muzzle came off when she was restraining a pet but they used a duck muzzle which imo is easier to get off and also the tech is also new and has only a few months of experience and even restraining takes practice
5. they muzzle every single pet! another thing no other clinic i've worked at does- we read animal behavior to see if they're skittish, growing, showing lip etc. she tells us to muzzle everyone solely based on their breed, even though as a tech we go into the room first and get medical history, do a temp in the ear, and weigh the pet etc so we get some idea of their behavior. idk it just seems so unnecessary; not that i want anyone to get bitten but it just doesnt make sense to me to not read the dog's behavior
6. they do 15 min doctors appts.. they're supposed to be 30 but they will fit in clients if they agree to pay an 85$ exam fee instead of 61$ but then we the techs are expected to do a whole ass work up with half the amount of time???

I message him from the doctor's office with my diagnosis.  The very first reply is ""do I need to take you off the schedule for tomorrow."" No expressing any concern for my injury which was bad enough that I left work early the day before.  I'm the kind of person who NEVER calls out unless I'm in a hospital.  

It hurt my feelings a little but he's been much less personable and less empathetic as a boss.  It doesn't help that the owner of the company is a sociopath in my opinion.  She talks in a high pitched happy voice, as if she's praising a dog.  But stand up for yourself once and she lets her true colors show.  

All of this is just another reason I'm so happy I've started my own business and am trying to make a go of it on my own.   Low pay, less empathy but more disrespect.  And I'm lucky for an American.

Couldn't you just fudge income numbers of your wage on your paystubs....or even change the company name even for those saying to supply a paystub with GIMP/photoshop?

The ""work"" of an employee is their product they sell to the company they work for. That's what the worker is to them. A product. 

And in capitalism, you should shop around and know the prices of the product you're selling.  And the prices in your area (office). 

But, they don't want people to share their wage information.

But you can't negotiate well if you don't know your local prices. And that's for any product in any business.. apples or labor. 

If you're selling apples, but they say you can't look at what all the other people selling apples are selling them for.. that's quite a disadvantage. 

In capitalism, you can gather your buying power to get better prices, like Walmart using all their stores to negotiate a lower price. 

But, unions are the same idea, gathering their product, labor, together to get a better price for the worker. 

They want capitalism for them, but not for the worker.  They want to close and control that market for labor as much as they can.

I currently work as a trading assistant (shelf stacker) in the UK for a very large supermarket business.

I‚Äôve been kept on for a few months after being a Christmas Temp, I‚Äôve got one more month here and if I do well enough, I‚Äôll be able to stay on permanently.
Today I was working a 5-9 which I love. However, this shift was going really weird, time just didn‚Äôt seem to make sense at all for me this shift and I truly didn‚Äôt feel right. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep at all last night either so that doesn‚Äôt help. About (what I thought was) halfway through my shift, I checked the time on my phone. I‚Äôm pretty damn sure I was 2 hours in. I move onto the next task (top stock on 2 aisles and empty this cage onto the shelves) where I got told that I was being extremely slow, apparently 45 minutes had passed since I asked what to do next and I wasn‚Äôt even 25% of the way through the 2 aisles. I decided to really pick my pace up and I thought I‚Äôve been working really hard this shift, I was super proud.
I checked my phone and I had 4 minutes left of my shift, so I emptied the cardboard and clicked out on time.
My manager then stops me by the entrance and questions what time I got on and off. I say ‚Äò5-9‚Äô and he double checks the time with me. It‚Äôs just gone 8pm. I say how sorry I am and that I‚Äôll get right back on shift and that it‚Äôs completely my fault, when he asks me if I‚Äôm alright.

I seriously don‚Äôt even remotely understand how the hell this happened. I could‚Äôve sworn I double checked to make sure the time was right and it was.

for example, for me it's

1. telling employers/employees how I really feel about work at the moment: when i was 17, i was working in a drugstore. i've only been working for 2 days. it was relatively slow and dead that day and someone asked me how it was going. i answered honestly and said ""it's a little boring but not bad"" at the end of the shift, i was told they would call me when they needed me. they never called me again.
2. calling out for a bathroom break: i drink a lot of water and naturally, go to the bathroom a lot. a former employer asked me if i have bladder issues and to maybe stop drinking so much water.
3. asking for changes in schedules: thankfully, my current job is pretty understanding of when i can work because i'm still in school. however, a few years back, i was working in a museum rather far from my house. i worked closing shifts and would get home close to midnight. my parents were concerned and asked me to change to opening instead. i agreed and went to talk to my manager about it. she said she would do something about it and never did. on christmas day a month later, she fired me because i ""kept complaining"" about the hours. i only brought it up twice to her.
4. using my phone at work: the big one. most of the places i worked at had a no-phone policy. regardless, i still used my phone. one time, though, i got caught and got suspended from work (same manager from #2) i wasn't really using my phone per say, but i did check the time a lot. even though my current job requires us to check phones (we use the Slack app) i still feel like a kid in high school hiding my phone whenever the managers are near.

So my uncle decided to not retire and fired his son and all his team. We were still in high school but were brought in through Internship arrangements to help.

Share your story",9,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spffk1/people_from_other_parts_of_the_world_what_made/,3,"I feel like this sub needs more international community discussions, as it is one of the most informative, active and decent places to talk about anti-work struggles for the unification of the common workers. I think it would benefit the general narrative if you, people from countries other than US, could share your perspectives, your grievances and your problems that led you to becoming curious in the antiwork movement.

Guess I'll start?

I'm a young (gen Z) office worker from CIS country where the usual monthly pay is around 400 to 500 USD and GDP per capita hovers just below 10k$. The minimum wage in my country is essentially 150$ a month, and people actually live on it here.  I got lucky as I was born to a well-off family and could get a decent education, even had opportunity to travel abroad extensively, and now have nice career prospects. For most of my life, I have been fed with two equally misleading promises: A) working hard will get you an even better life, B) you shoud focus on migrating to the West (especially to the US) if you wish to reach the paradise. As you might guess, reality hits hard. 

Things started falling apart when my family fell out of grace with authorities and we had to cut our spendings by a lot. I've started working since first year into university to pull my weight and that's when I started to suspect something is not adding up. I now make roughly x3 of what a median worker makes, and I have no idea of how to get back to even the fraction of life I had with my parents as a child. My mother, bless her heart, had the opportunity to show me the world when she made roughly two times less than I do now. I dread the prospect of moving out of my parent's place. If I'd wanted to buy the flat I live in right now, I'd have to save *for 24 years straight without spending a cent* (that is considering the prices don't go up any more)*.* Suffice to say, not even my parents can now afford anything within the city. The official inflation rate the govs pretend to see is around 7%, the real inflation for just the past 6 months surpasses 40%. The food on the shelves becomes more expensive each day, the quality keeps diminishing. The universal healthcare praised by my country is so bad I'm literally afraid of going to a local hospital (I can't blame the staff though - they often have to survive on 300$ a month). The payment inflation adjustments are literally nonxistent in the majority of companies I know of, mine included (and I actually love the place I work in as I get full health coverage and plenty of benefits). Getting another education? Having kids? Moving out? Having a car? Might as well dream of owning a phallic rocket. 

Then I encounter this subreddit. At first, I'm livid. ""They must be mistaken"", I think, ""They must be lazy pricks who do nothing in life and want everything for free"". I was promised the American dream. I was told life would get better if I just made it to the other continent. If I was lucky or smart enough, or both. I have to admit, I hated this sub and every little post made here. I couldn't accept the fact that my dream was somebody else's nightmare. Still, I stick around, I read more, and with each post, each comment thread, I become more and more infatuated with the ideas spread here. I start normalizing common things like labor condition discussions and payment discussion in workplace (actually helped my colleague to negotiate a better deal not so long ago), I start standing up to my parents, who continue to preach their outdated capitalist mantras while steadily ruining their health for the sake of staying afloat, I start to indulge myself in political and economic discussions with my friends again, start re-reading Marx, Weber, Kant. 

I feel helpless, I feel derailed, I feel as though I'm denied a fraction of hope I had up to this moment, that somewhere across the ocean there is the perfect paradise for future rich hardworking me (ha-ha-ha). Turns out, it sucks being just a normal person no mater where you go. At the same time, I see that I'm not alone. I know I'm not mad, lazy or stupid. I know there is a big community of people who share my disdain with the rich and the powerful running this helltrain down the cliff for a quick buck - no matter the country you name. Most of all, I feel that this desire for change that unifies me with more than a million people across the world keeps growing and keeps getting stronger. 

Whether intentionally or not, this sub has become more than the sum of it parts. I'd like to thank each of you for making, keeping and growing this community. For saying out loud that we are not alone. That would be all from me.

He straight up told me what he was offering salary wise and it was right around my asking price. No bs, no back and forth, no having to convince myself to take a lower offer because it is closer to where I live.

Here is the best part. They are giving the person I am replacing two weeks notice. They are allowed to interview during working hours no questions asked. They don't have to stay the full two weeks, but they are getting paid regardless in addition to severance.

Only when the rich and poor go through the same experience in terms of consuming basic things then only everyone will develop empathy.

When managers would spend atleast 50% time working in the same role as their reports then only they would understand the pain and effort.

When rich will live in the same amount of space and eat the same food as poor then only they would advocate for improving the basic necessities.

Apart from it people should be allowed/encouraged to splurge like go travel in first class of air travel but at the end of the day you will sleep in same room as everyone else and eat the same quality/quantity of food..

Because this would come up, only one and only variety of every food should be sold (by government) like everyone gets same quota of chicken and rice (same quality and same quantity) maybe for few things quantity cap can be removed (like rice) but rest all should remain the same.

Currently I am taking 19 credit hours and simply did not have the time for the job anymore, the hours were overnight and evenings on the weekend. 

I sent my notice in on Sunday, the upcoming weekend I was scheduled to work overnight, I could not do this as I have two projects due the following week, I told my manager this three weeks ago and he decided to continue having me work that shift. He did not want to be flexible so I quit.

Also, ""This makes me question your character as you can't be reliable."" I have not seen this man since I was interviewed by him. He went into how he did ""22 credits a semester while in the military."" I don't think they even allow that. He also wanted to tell me how I had ""an obligation"" to continue working there.

My friend works in a really strict, uptight, by-the-book corporation. They are a couple of people in the team, not more than 7-8 in total. They each have their responsibilities, but at the end of the day, they collaborate together to achieve a joint goal. Their work also depends on one another, so if someone is missing today, one of the people that are at work, needs to do the missing member's work as well.  
So, rolling back the story to a few months ago, my friend tells me, that this Tam person (name is made-up, for easier referencing throughout this post), each second week or so, or at least 2-3 times in the month, Tam would go missing. Either Tam is sick, or Tam is away unannounced, he caught corona a record-braking 4 times so far, and so-on, using all the existent and non-existent excuses in the book, to avoid doing work. Also, my friends team, all of them work from home during the pandemic, and usually, once every month or so, they go to the office to meet each other and complete some important piece of work. Tam naturally, would always have some excuse to not show up.  
Another thing is that Tam also has some close family in another country, so each Friday afternoon, and Monday morning (the exact times of some cheap flights), he comes down with a sore throat or similar...  
This has been going on for a while, about 1.5 years to be exact. Which brings me to the latest story that my friend told me recently. Apparently, Tam pulled-off a mega-move, ghosting his employer and the team. So how it happened, roughly, is that one day, Tam just stopped coming to work. For the first 1-2 days, people assumed it was business as usual, Tam is sick again, whatever, people are used to it... Then 3-4 days have passed, and Tam's superior, the leader of the team, tries to contact Tam. No response. Then a few days later, the leader of the team calls the emergency contact for Tam, no response. Basically, it has been \~2-3 weeks now, and nobody has heard a thing from Tam.  
My friend has Tam on whatsapp, and notices that the number does not exist anymore, and Tam has probably cancelled the subscription for that number for a while... Also, this comes in the perhaps the most busiest time for the business domain that my friend is working in...  
My friend suspects that Tam has had a look at employment law, as he stopped showing up, on exactly the same day that the pay calculation starts, so he got 100% of the previous period's pay. Also, employment law says if you don't show up for N weeks, your contract is terminated, so he is now gone off the books as well...  
My question is, is this normal nowadays...? Is this something people do?!",1644531659.0

I ended up staying at this woman's house for 3 hours today getting her, her two kids, and her sister signed up. At one point she offered me coffee (which our company says we ""have to"" accept otherwise it would be rude) and I drank two. Had to use the restroom.

She then offered for me to use her restroom and showed it to me. I peed for like 30 seconds. Washed my hands. Finished up and then left.

So basically it means that our employers only pay for our salaries 10% of the time. This is usually charged as Admin. If you get sick, have to do some training, have to fill out safety sheets, etc. all of that goes to Admin time. If you go below 90% you get fired. 

 To me, this is inherent exploitation because our employers don't even really pay us. We have to depend on other companies to give us work, or we are fired. I know some of you on here will begin to explain that this is because we sell our labor and not a product, as if I didn't already know this.

spd0zj,Taking our solidarity to the next level with mutual aid,7,0.82,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spd0zj/taking_our_solidarity_to_the_next_level_with/,9,"I'm really happy to see the sub growing so much and all the well placed anger that's leading to positive change but I feel like there is still more that we can do. 

I really love the push towards unionization that I've been seeing lately, as well as the solidarity with strikes, but I still feel like we are missing a massive opportunity for more positive change. I know this sub is about combating work and improving working conditions and rights and unions and strikes do work to achieve that but there's still much they don't do.  

Workers can't have a successful strike if they don't have goods at home. They will faulter and return to work to survive. I know unions have strike funds for this purpose but also I know that the majority of union funds go to hiring lawyers for contract negotiations and other strictly wage and benefit side campaigns. [source](https://guide.unitworkers.com/union-dues-explained/)

That's where I feel mural aid organizations can come in and help for a multitude of reasons. 

1. Mutal aid can fill the material gap for successful strikes and unionization efforts:

""In¬†organization theory,¬†mutual aid¬†is a voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions"" [source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory))

Mutal aid can take many forms, from community food banks, funds for eviction protection, bail and medical costs, to community gardens and offering someone a place to stay in your home[source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)). All these things can be very helpful ways in supporting union and strike efforts. Because resources are the main thing preventing people from successfully striking and unionizing. 

Let's face it as much as we hate our jobs in this horrible world we live in we need them to survive. That's why many people are afraid to try to fight for better working conditions because it threatens their work and their survival. But with mutal aid we can take that fear away and make unionization and striking easier. 

If people know their community will supply them with food when they might get fired for forming a union they will be more willing to take that chance. If a employer is being stubborn and not bending to union demands and the strike fund is running low mutal aid can keep the strikers supplied and starve the employer before the workers will breaks. If an employer tries to aquire desperate lower class people to work as scabs mutual aid can provide those desperate people the things they need so they won't scab on the strikers. Mutual aid can kill a lot of the dangers workers face with kindness. 

Mutual aid can be the vital support unions and strikes need to be more successful. If unions and strikes are the spear head that slays the dragon capitalism, mutal aid is the spear shaft that pushes the strike home. 

2. Mutual aid can help make allies, build a base of power, and enact equity:

This I feel is the major opportunity we are missing. Everyday we can see things getting worse. Inflation destroying saving, rent rising, massive and unnecessary debt keeping people from living good lives and a hundred other issues keeping the majority of people down. 

People need help but the systems that be have refused to help them and instead chose to capitalize on their suffering. This is where we as a community and as a movement can use mutual aid to provide people with the things they need and sway them to our cause. 

Because in all honesty lofty ideals, and sweet promises of a workers utopia won't change the minds of those who have had anti worker propaganda pounded into them since birth. The way we change their minds to our side is by helping them when no one else will. If we can show people that we can help them and provide for them when others dont, they might think differently about the left and the workers movement and might join us. They also might not and they might simply take our help and continue to hate us or refuse it all together. In my mind that's an acceptable outcome as even if we help someone who hates us it's still one less person suffering under capitalisms apathy and that's a victory in my book. 

Next building a base of power. The more we help people the more people will join us and make it easier to help more people. This is how we build our base of power to enter into the political game and try to make large scale change. 

Because again ideals and promises that get obstructed as soon as they hit the law makers floor won't change anyone's mind. We need victories and laws to change but we are facing obstruction from every side so we need a strong base of support to elect more radical representatives and be an undeniable voting block that demands change. 

With the obstruction we face we can't try to force people into office and be upset when they fail in a broken system. We need to start by building a base of power and then getting more people in office and gets our demands met. To that end we need to change people's minds by providing for them.

Lastly equity. There's a saying we hear a lot: that no one is free until everyone is free, and I strongly agree. This movement is still plagued with the individualism that built this sick capitist world. Every day we see stories about ""MY job sucks"" or ""MY boss sucks"" or ""I left MY old job and got a better one."" We have the right idea but we and stratified and disorganized. Quitting our jobs and asking for better things as individuals when we should be doing this as a movement. I still don't believe we have a concrete set of terms or demands as a movement. 

So it is great that we are trying to free ourselves here but we need to focus on freeing everyone especially those that can't free themselves. I'm talking about people who through generations of systemic neglect, or racism, or poverty, abuse and a thousand other things are trapped in horrible situations and places with little or no safety nets and forced to fight their neighbors out of desperation to survive. These people can't help themselves because they have to focus on surviving today. You can't make a better home or fight for worker rights when everyday is live or die. 

With mutual aid we can support the communities that need it most. We can have the solidarity and altruism we seek. Imagine if a head line read ""Flint's lead pipes fixed through the resources gathered by the anti-work mutual aid fund."" Can you imagine how big that would be? We would not only help those people that need it most but also show ourselves to the world and to the people that we are more capable and caring than the government and any rich person. 

Not only will it be good press but helping those on the lowest rung of society will make build new allies and loosen the chains capitalism has on us all. The lowest class of people are unfortunately a living threat to everyone above them. A sword hanging above our heads proclaiming ""stay in line or the suffering you see over there will be inflicted upon you"". By improving these people's lives and making safer, and healthier communities the threat evaporates and creates a new class of people no longer restrained with the effort of surviving everyday. With their needs met with our help they can also join in our cause of organizing and fighting for better conditions. 

When they are freed they can fight along side us until we are all freed. 

3. Mutual aid can create an alternative supply chain and aid in a general strike. 

With the broad and flexible definition of what mutual aid can be I see no reason why it couldn't be an effort to create an alternative supply chain. With mutual aid communities could pool their money and collectively buy the supplies they need. Better yet they could go to suppliers of food, medicine, clothing etc. And buy it from the source, whole sale and redistribute it to their communities. For enough money any supplier will take that deal. It could even be possible to build alternative supply routes with volunteers working as distributors of goods, traveling around their communities, or between communities to deliver, transport and aquire necessary goods.

Alternatively if funds are an issue communities could work to supply themselves internally. With community gardens, individuals working to preserve food that is grown, others working to build homes, furniture or devices that someone might need, others working as distributors. With the right organization any community could accomplish this. 

Either option would be beneficial for multiple reasons. First it would reduce the need for people to work to survive as their base needs are being met. They can instead focus on fighting for better working conditions or ceasing to work all together. Second it would reduce the reliance on capitalist supply chains that are exploitative and destructive as with a mutual supply chain there is no need for profit as the only goal is everyone is supplied which is a much more sustainable goal. Thirdly an alternative supply chain can improve the success of a general strike.

I've seen the idea of a general strike been tossed around here a few times, with a day set and then nothing to show for it. A general strike without organization and more importantly goods will always fail. Firstly because if no one agrees or let alone knows on what the plan is for a strike there can be no strike. With mutual aid networks a general strike can be coordinated more effectively as the people participating in the mutual aid network can be more clear about their needs and the needs of those they serve and given this information set a date for a strike would be most effective and most doable. 

Second an alternative supply chain can give people the resources they need to complete a general trike successfully. We've probably seen the idea by now based on the CDC new guide line that a 10 day general strike would shatter the economy and allow us to demand anything we want in order to return to work. However not everyone has the resources or access to 10 days worth of supplies. 

10 days is enough to kill people especially in the event of a general strike where food won't move, people won't be able to pick up medicine, people may be evicted, water or other utilities may be shut off from lack of payment or cruel retaliation, violence may be done. We can't count any injustice off the ruling class' table in order to break our will and end the strike. 

But with mutual aid and an alternative supply chain we can supply people with the things they need for the time necessary to succeed in a general strike and achieve the change we want to see. 


Hopefully you read this far and agree with what I wrote. I hope I laid out my thoughts in away that is understandable and convincing. I don't mind what's happening on the sub at all. There's solidarity, theres advice, there's support. But more direct action needs to be taken to make the changes we want to see. So I would thank you if you considered joining a mutual aid society, donating to one, volunteering, or making your own. In addition I have an idea for a large scale online mutual aid network similar to gofundme where people can donate directly to causes or fund they believe in. It can be a good place to organize and have funds in one place without capitalist interference but I don't have the skill to accomplish it so if someone wants to talk more about that please let me know. Thank you all and I hope you have a good day. 

Tldr; I believe for multiple reasons such as helping unions and strikes, making allies and helping others, and creating alternative supply chains for a general strike, that mutual aid(the collaborative and communal redistribution of willingly given resources) can achieve the changes we want to see.

He has worked his way up with the same company for nearly 30 years and is now a store manager. He averages 60hrs/wk plus the time he spends on his days off.


Despite his best efforts to avoid it, every week on his days off he has to take calls, answer text messages and respond to 'urgent' emails. This past week during his two ""days off"", my dad had to attend a conference call, took 17 calls, responded to 23 text messages and glimpsed through 47 emails because his bosses said it was mandatory and necessary for the business. Tomorrow he is heading back to work after his two ""days off"" looking even more burned out than when his days off began. Yet when any employee reaches out to the bosses on their days off, their phones go straight to voicemail and those fucks are nowhere to be found.


No matter what day my dad is off, some bullshit conference call always comes up to discuss shit everyone already knew that nobody gives a fuck about. Im fucking tired of that shit company treating employees like their property and forcing them to work on their days off. 


What can he (and other exempt employees) do to push back and at the very least gave some sense of time off during their time off? What protection does he have under CA law?",1644557274.0

sp930e,My resignation letter to my former employer,13,0.93,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sp930e/my_resignation_letter_to_my_former_employer/,3,"*this was sent out to over 90 employees across three states.  I found this in my emails from 2018 and thought I would share


To All;
    It is with great pleasure that I tender my resignation today from ****** Enterprises and remove myself from the ranks of the ***** Windows and Doors sales team.  As an individual with over twenty five years experience in home improvement I am appalled at the lack of integrity of the brand and the gross inferiority of the product. The class action lawsuit only scratches the surface of the flaws throughout the catalog.
    The way this company from Iowa on down treats its sales team is a complete joke.  Sending out mailers with deep discounts that the commissioned salesman have to ‚Äòeat‚Äô from their commission or ‚Äònegative discount‚Äô is sham and lacks any form of integrity.  Demanding that we LIE to the homeowner about the class action lawsuit and tell them the suit only entitles them to a ‚Äò25% discount‚Äô (also chipped right from the salesmen‚Äôs commission) is a clear violation of the lawsuit guidelines.
       On a franchise level the owner B*** is a seven foot tall man child and a bully. Personally telling the Buffalo sales team that ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt give a fuck about our kids, our family arrangements, or evening plans‚Äù and telling us we are HIS ‚Äúsix days a week, five nights a week and three Saturdays a month‚Äù was the clearest indicator I needed to see how much of a pile of heaping rosy cheeked shit he is.  Then came the buzz and talk throughout the company of the multiple lawsuits he is embroiled in, including sexual harassment and the fact that **** Corporate is planning on yanking the franchises out from under him due to them.  This is why the Buffalo sales team and countless others have departed since I joined the ranks. 
     This franchise has nearly a hundred people supposedly working in its offices to support the over all sales of the company.  Other than M*** H****, A**** W*****, G**** W****** and small handful of individuals  I have never felt I had support, only adversaries. G*** W****** did a great job training me on company products and options but had little she could educate me on with PQM.  
    I was sent to Iowa for two weeks where I was drilled with sales technique and how to ‚Äòone call close‚Äô but very little to no training on PQM or how to actually submit an order once it sold. I wasn‚Äôt educated on processing deposits or even explained that I would be the one processing them. With a supposed support staff of this size it makes little sense to saddle the 100% commission sales rep with bank related matters.  The list of incidences of ‚Äòpassing the buck‚Äô are countless. The atmosphere of ‚Äòcover your own ass and screw anyone else‚Äô is systemic throughout the company.  Most are more concerned about not pissing B*** off or basking in the ego their little job title gives them than actually servicing the customer.
    Which brings me to two individuals particularly that I would like to address.  T*** S****** is mediocre salesman turned IT guy who lives by the mantra ‚ÄúIts not my job‚Äù and wants his little ‚Äòservice tickets‚Äô that do nothing but satisfy his ego and delay the resolution of problems. His smug and arrogant attitude could be laughable if it weren‚Äôt so annoying‚Ä¶and he is a tattle tale.  
The worst sniveling petulant child in the company has to be J** ‚Äúrespect my authority‚Äù W*****. His petty and melodramatic behavior is also a joke. This is a man who will stop a job in its tracks over the most trivial detail. His only interest is to make a hundred keystrokes to point out a problem via email rather than making four to correct it. He is one of the root problems in this company in terms of customer service. He is widely known throughout the sales teams as a thorn. He cares very little about satisfying the customer; he only cares about satisfying his ego and not getting demerits from the ‚Äòexecutive management‚Äô.
Am I perfect? Nope. I have made my share of mistakes and own them.  I have no doubt that I was set up to fail at this company simply by working with cut throats, tattle tales, buck passers and people who flat out have no interest in participating in a team atmosphere. To those who have treated me kindly I offer you the best of luck and bid you well

It‚Äôs dumb, because I know the schedule wasn‚Äôt written yet.

I‚Äôm cool with working any other holiday. But V-Day? I hate this stupid ‚Äúholiday‚Äù. It‚Äôs just commercialism for corporations to profit drain people.

If you‚Äôre in a relationship, you should love and take care of your partner EVERYDAY, not just one day of the calendar year.

Even Christmas is commercialized, but it at least has an important meaning behind it (both from a religious POV and not religious).

It‚Äôs bad enough having to see couples in a relationship on a daily basis, it hurts me. But an entire day ALL ABOUT IT???

At Kroger, they make everything a big deal. All it is for the corporation is about money, just like everything else. They want me there to help because it‚Äôs busy, guess what? I care more about myself than that, even though I hate myself and don‚Äôt really care about myself.

I don‚Äôt want to be around other people on that day, I want to lock myself in my room and be by myself. 

They‚Äôll probably want me to go help in that tent, to make things even worse. Weirdly it didn‚Äôt bother me the last few years (that I can remember) but I guess I was just still more hopeful that there was hope for me to have a loving girlfriend, and more hopeful about life in general.

I already told supervisor I have a doctor appointment on that day (I don‚Äôt). They said since the schedule is already written, I‚Äôd have to switch shifts with someone. The people I asked today already work on V-Day.

If I call in sick, they‚Äôll know I‚Äôm faking now. If I stick to the ‚Äúdoctors appointment‚Äù, and insist I can‚Äôt go in, they might try to make me either come in for a few hours later, or provide a doctor note.

I hate that my life has even come to this point, I‚Äôm too old for this (job and life circumstances ending me up here) but exposing myself to all the people who can actually get into relationships won‚Äôt be some ‚Äúexposure therapy‚Äù for me, it‚Äôll only put me in a 1000x worse mindset and mood.

I really don‚Äôt even care if I get written up, I‚Äôve never been written up and you get 3 before termination, right? I kind of want to be fired, but I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do next, so I‚Äôd really rather not get fired.

Like, if I call in or insist I CANNOT miss my doctor appointment, and I don‚Äôt provide a doctor note (unless my doctor can write one even though I‚Äôm not actually seeing them at this time) what‚Äôs the worst that‚Äôll happen to me?

I‚Äôm trying to keep the concept of ‚Äúromantic and sexual‚Äù relationships out of my mind, I‚Äôm trying to suppress my desire for that from any women, because I‚Äôm ugly and work at Kroger (bagging and pushing carts, even worse).

I seriously might have some kind of outburst or meltdown, it‚Äôs just too much to keep bottled up.

I don‚Äôt really care about this job that much, it‚Äôs dead end, for years on end they‚Äôll keep you at the bottom, and there is really no level that is really great. I‚Äôd rather be dead anyway, I feel if I quit or get fired I might have to seriously be ready to end my life, because I can‚Äôt seem to do better and I can‚Äôt deal with the consequences, whether my situation is my fault or not.

And he has Crohn's disease. I am a teacher and had saved my leave for years in case of an emergency like this. I took 5 weeks off back in September. My principal went through my records and put a disciplinary note in my file about not following expectations to record grades, even tho I was on leave. 

They also tried to say I didn't follow my department protocols, but my department chair is a duplicitous piece of shit who never says what the expectation is, so I was never told what to do. 

I took my union rep to the meeting because they lied to me about what the meeting was about. I did my homework. I had all the emails to demonstrate I was following expectations. He didn't care and put it in my file anyway. He blatantly interrupted me while I was trying to share my side of things (my union rep isn't very good), and  blatantly told me when I pointed out that I was answering his questions but that he kept interrupting and I asked ""do you want me to share my information with you""? He replied ""honestly, no. I don't want to listen to you read that word for word"". Not only that he tried to get me to not tell anyone else in the school about the situation. 

The last part was that I pointed out to him this was an incredible technicality to be dealing with since I have a spotless employee record. He tried to say that it was just standard practice on their end (it's not. I am well aware of teachers who break important rules and are ignored). I said, this wasn't how this had to be handled. And be tried to insist it was. That when I pointed out this is not how ""family"" works. 

He was visibly flabbergasted. He said at that point he had said all he had to say. 

Fuck that mother fucker. Fuck him. I have not once been disciplined at that job in seven years and he went back 5 months to find something that happened while I was on FMLA and would not even listen to what I had to say. 

Here's the kicker. A few years ago we worked in a different district at different schools. I worked at an ALE for kids who are struggling at regular school. I always took their stories with a grain of salt, because I know what it feels like to be an angry teenager. I believed them, but I left room for a different pov. Nope. Those kids were right to the letter. He is an absolute piece of shit and if he got ran over by a truck tomorrow, I would go out and get a beer to celebrate. He has hurt so many of my students just because he loves rules. That's it. I've tried to stand up for the kids. And that may be why I got punished. The kids like me. They told him as much. I get zero parent complaints. But he hates anyone who stands up for people who are marginalized. He wants kids to sit in their seat, shut up, work their ass off to get good test scores to make himself look good. We'll see how that works out. Lol

Teachers, quit. You guys need to quit. I wanted to save the kids and the schools, but this is what they always do. They hire someone like him to keep everyone beat down and following orders. Just quit got Christ sake.

This company will be referred to as ""üçï"" .

I started working at üçï about 6 months ago. I live with my parents and grandmother. I thought I should contribute to the house more so I started looking for jobs. As per usual, apply to a hundred and see 4 responses back.

üçï Called me a week after applying. I was doing dancing with my hamsters from the excitement. I show to my interview. GM interviews me. 

Asks me things like:

Age?

Address?

Availability?

I was nervous as fuck. Like classroom presentation nervous.

She goes on about how she had to fire almost all previous staff due to lack of work and presentation. ""So obviously I'm going to hire you."" Bruh, got a job under 5mins.

*Skip to 3 months later*

This üçï location is wildin. Employees stealing, threatening, quiting. . .and I'm still there. I mind my business.

*Skip to 2 months later*

GM is breaking. I see it in her. I feel her. 6 people gone in one week. ONE FREAKING WEEK! And I'm still there. A few weeks later she puts her two weeks in. They wouldn't let her step down as GM, quitting was somewhat her only option out. I like her and only really stayed because despite me hating being around others . . .I can't watch a person struggle and do nothing.

GM quits midway through her two weeks. I'm still here. 

New GM will be referred to as NGM. NGM is pretty cool. Except that one time she said I reminded her if the ""Meh emoji"" (fuck her for that). I'm getting paid $12 as a CRS thanks to old GM's raise. I have one week left. 

NGM comes up to me while I'm prepping. She tries to convince me to stay. Offers me $13 and morning shift. (For those who don't know, morning shift at a pizza place is basically heaven)

Fuck it. I took the deal. $13 an hour as csr, not too bad. Well the job still sucks ass. I'm stressed the fuck out. Like I'm *STRESSING*. I'm exhausted. I'm worn. I'm breaking. I'm being stepped on and I'm not doing anything about it.

*Current months*

It's happening again. Shitty scheduling. Me, manager, and one driver (my mom üíï). Imagine having one driver 9-5 on a SATURDAY!!!!! I don't like see my mom being put through that. 

Managers go on smoke breaks every fucking 20mins. Leaving me all alone in a store. I'm 5ft 98lbs, I'm basically a stick. What if something happens while they were smoking weed or cancer by the back door? I had dreams of people placing phone orders and then threatening to shoot up üçï because I messes up a little. 

I want to leave. And where to do I wish to go? The dollar store. Dollar tree will probably pay me 11-12. Its a 15min walk from home to there. Not bad, I can save for a car. As I'm planning this, I ask my best buddy to call and ask if the dollar tree is hiring. She said the manager said ""YES!"" with excitement. Good. Now to apply.

Guess what. A few hours later NGM comes to me while I'm prepping. ""I'm going to train you to be a level one assistant manager""

.‡ºé‡∫∂‚Äø‡ºé‡∫∂. My plan . . .

She told me as an assistant manager I would have to step in if the scheduled manager couldn't show up. That's when she lost me. I knew what was going to happen. I had a whole *that's so Raven* moment. I was going to be abused. ""*I can't come in, can you cover me?*"" ""*I need you to come in right now*"". I don't want that. I don't want that responsibility. I've been offered to be a morning manager and everytime I turned down. I don't want to *take care* of customers or employees. 

Before this gets too long I'll stop now.

I need to see another's persons view on this. One friend says I'm picky, another says go for it, and my best bud told me to make a run for the hills.

I have a cw that has been belligerent in the past to several others and recently my boss said he would speak to him. This was during my review since I found the courage to speak up about a few incidents.  He knew of 1 but not the others.  
Fast forward to today, I get to my desk and cw is on a call with another cw in a different state.  He's going on about how he didn't get a salary grade bump, and the company is bowing to the minorities.  Then spouts off the Joe Rogan bs and how it's free speech etc. He is talking loudly so I know others heard him including my boss. No one stopped him. So now I am trying to decide if I can report him anonymously to HR. I just don't want to seem like the hysterical female, etc. It took a lot of courage to speak up earlier and that was only a couple of weeks ago. I feel I should not have to listen to his derogatory comments all the time, but don't want to be a stick in the mud either.  
For reference he screamed at a nurse a few Weeks ago bc he didn't want to give his vax status and said wearing a mask would cause him to get sick.

‚ÄúOn May 1, 1886, 350,000 workers staged a nationwide work stoppage to demand the adoption of a standard eight-hour workday. Forty thousand workers struck in Chicago, Illinois; ten thousand struck in New York; eleven thousand struck in Detroit, Michigan. As many as thirty-two thousand workers struck in Cincinnati, Ohio, although some of these workers had been out on strike for several months before May 1.

The purpose of the May Day Strike was to bring pressure on employers and state governments to create an eight-hour workday.‚Äù

[The Seattle General Strike](https://depts.washington.edu/labhist/strike/)
‚ÄúOn the morning of February 6, 1919, Seattle, a city of 315,000 people, stopped working. 25,000 other union members had joined 35,000 shipyard workers already on strike. The city's AFL unions, 101 of them, had voted to walk out in a gesture of support and solidarity. And most of the remaining work force stayed home as stores closed and streetcars stopped running. The city was stunned and quiet.‚Äù

[General Strike of 1934](https://socialism.com/fs-article/the-general-strike-in-us-history-what-it-is-and-why-its-still-needed/)
‚ÄúIn the depth of the Great Depression, in 1934, there were general strikes in San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Toledo. Industrial unionism was proving its mettle, and unions used audacious tactics, including sit-down strikes and roving pickets. When bosses compelled local governments to launch crackdowns or even summon the National Guard, many workers, both employed and unemployed, came to the defense of strikers. It was the ferocity and tenacity of those fighters that pressured Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, establishing the collective bargaining rights that so many are trying to preserve today.‚Äù",1644512793.0

The night before my first day of leave, I notified everyone I thought I needed to notify. I informed everyone that I would have to travel and help with funeral arrangements and I wouldn‚Äôt know when I would return until after we set a date for the funeral. My hope was to take the week off using my three allotted bereavement days plus two sick days. However, I was also aware that there was a chance the funeral wouldn‚Äôt take place until the week after so everything was very up in the air. I let everyone know that I would be checking my email when I could in case anything urgent was needed from me. I was stupid enough to think that people would show some level of respect and restraint though and just email me for emergencies and reasonable requests. Boy was I wrong.

I wound up having to do a few hours of work on my first day of leave. I was willing to write that off though and move on but it didn‚Äôt stop there. Almost immediately after offering his condolences, someone asked me to let him know when I would be available that week to discuss something that honestly was not as pressing as he was making it out to be. By the second day of my leave he had asked me about this multiple times via email and IM and tried setting up a meeting. Keep in mind that this was all while I was in the midst of trying to help plan a funeral and I didn‚Äôt know yet what day it would be taking place. So I still didn‚Äôt know when I would return.

Multiple other colleagues who were aware of my leave and the reason behind it reached out with lists of high priority projects that should have been routed to someone else due to my leave. Technically, these people were not even supposed to come to me directly and were supposed to go through a project manager. Knowing I was out, they CC‚Äôed someone else who should have been able to step up and help but he never said a word despite knowing the situation. This left me struggling to come up with a response and attempting to assess project requests while crying in my grandmother‚Äôs favorite chair. Assessing these requests is not even supposed to be part of my job. A PM is supposed to assess and filter everything.

This took up several hours until I gave up around 2am and went to bed. Because of the high demand for my attention, I could not afford to take off a third day and logged in early the next morning to once again try to make sense of the things being asked of me. Things did not go well. By noon I had barely accomplished anything and by 1pm I‚Äôd had a mental breakdown in the kitchen.

It was my old project managers who saved me when they noticed I was online and asked me what was going on. By the end of the work day they had met with everyone they needed to in order to clear my plate for the week so that I could have the time to process and grieve. This is all stuff that was supposed to be done by someone else but these two really stepped up for me.

Thanks to them, I‚Äôm able to take my third day of leave. With the funeral being next week, I was going to use two sick days but I‚Äôm now considering taking this to HR and asking for their permission to take two additional bereavement days since I had to work during the time that I originally requested off.

I‚Äôm trying really hard not to take any of this personally but I really feel like I was kicked while I was down by people who are supposed to be my teammates.

It appeared to have landed in my inbox as if by magic. I hadn't sent in a resume or crafted a tortured cover letter. None of the usual stuff. For once, someone had approached me.

I briefly talked to the recruiter on the phone, and little by little, I allowed myself to get my hopes up. The job most certainly wasn't a scam, and it would have been a huge step up, pay-wise, from what I'm doing now. For a brief second, I felt like I could breathe, like I might wind up doing something I could be proud of, the kind of job you'd assume an educated person my age would have.

I surmised that I had failed their editing test almost immediately after I sent it in. It was in PDF form, which I was unfamiliar with, and I spent half the time scrambling to figure out how to work the software, so I couldn't focus on the actual editing. When I looked at my responses after I sent the document back, I caught a couple of errors that never would have escaped me under normal circumstances. In this field, there is no margin for error.

I knew the inevitable ""thanks but no thanks"" call was coming, but I still held onto a small kernel of hope that they might be desperate enough to fill the position that they'd overlook those small mistakes. At first, the recruiter's voice sounded cheery, but when she switched to a ""thank you for taking the time to apply"" tone, I knew my instincts were correct. This is the closest I've ever come to a solid, decent, well-paid job in my life. Everything I've done up to now has been glorified slave labor.

I don't know how I'm supposed to keep living like this. I'm an intelligent person, but it means nothing because I don't have the funds, spare time, or mental energy to expand my skillset. I wish I were dead.",1644520511.0

Second elephant, minimum wage, R$1.005,00 per month, something between $170~190 american dolars... It's very low, this means that if you don't have a degree, you are going to strugle to find something far from the minimum.

Third elephant, average cost of living can vary a LOT depending on where you live, Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world distributed mostly vertically acros the globe, this means someone up in the north may have a life style completelly ALIEN to someone in the south and vice-versa, as I live in the south, I can only speak about it, I have no base whatsoever to tell you about cost of living in other states rather than mine... 

Rent of a small cozy house on a developing suburb in a small city can cost you R$500,00 ($70~90), that alone got you down to half your money... If you want a car, banks will gladly make you a loan, assuming you got a shitty old car for R$12.000 ($2.000~2.200), your bill by the month could be somewhere between R$400 to 600 ($70~110), and there is the other half of your minimum wage...

Most people I know earn something about R$1.500 and 2.000 ($300~400), wich make living a lot easier, but not a bit fancy, you just get by with this...

BUT

A very strong point about Brazil is that you have MANY more rights as a worker than in the US, Brazil is actually know for how well it protects the workers, OF COURSE this isn't a general rule, but the laws exists and those who know about their rights and didn't screw up somehow WILL most likelly have it done, here are some of the main rights...

13th salary, here we are paid by the month, but at the end of the year EVERY registered worker have an extra salary, essentially making your 12th month pay double.

EVERY worker have 30 paid vacation days.

Maximum 8 hours daily at work, anything over that, you have a bonus payment of 50% by the hour on week days or 100%(!!!) on holidays and sundays OR you can have a think called ""hours bank"", where if you work an extra hour today, you can work a hour less tomorow.

Paid weekly day-off, mostly sundays, your boss is paying for that.

Unemployent plans, if you haven't been fired by just cause, you have that

Garanty fund by time worked, essentialy, the company you work on HAVE to make an deposit of 8% your salary (not taken out of it) every month, if you happen to be fired but not just cause fired, you will have all the amount stored PLUS 50% as fine.

Among MANY others, I cound't possibly make a full on workers rights on a Reddit post in one day...

And also remmember, healthcare here is COMPLETELY FREE, yes, I know this is a whole new other topic, but to summarise, it can be awfull in some places and absolutelly fucking great in others

But anywhere in Brazil, insulin costs nothing

With no kids, not married in Germany and 50k income before taxes, you'll pay about 500‚Ç¨ of public health insurance per month.

For comparison, 50 pills of Ibuprofen 400mg (no prescription necessary) cost 5‚Ç¨ as well. You're covered anywhere inside the EU.

Edit: My employer pays the same amount as I do in taxes. So 50k before tax equal around 32k after tax (take home) and my employer actually pays 80k. If I don't have a job and am not qualified for unemployment pay (recently let go) however, the goverment pays everything and I am still insured and get the same medical attention.

It was a toxic work environment -- even our handbook said that we are required to work scheduled and unscheduled work without pay, must arrive 15 minutes prior to the start of one's day, must believe in God, must believe in the constitution, and must say the pledge of allegiance every day. Now, educators work for free ALL THE TIME, especially ones who really care about their job. It's sometimes something you accept as part of the job, especially with younger age groups. Hell, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some of the after-hours crafting I've done for my classrooms and students. This employer, though, absolutely pushed this beyond any acceptable limits. As hourly employees, we were not to be paid for conferences, meetings, events, etc. We could be talking 2-8 hours of additional work following regular work hours on any given day. As for God and the constitution, I'm not sure of the legality. But making preschoolers say the pledge? That's just a big ""no"" from me LOL

The owner of this center is like a classic MLM ""boss babe"" but extra scary. She dropped out of law school to focus in her business. Not sure how else to describe her. She always called me a ""Karen"" because as a worker I'm optimistic and friendly, I'm big on gratitude and communication. She had a major habit of ridiculing and pushing employees to quit and/or leaving threats to fire us if we displayed positive qualities that she did not. Threats usually took the form of very threateningly written letter reminding you that she can and will fire you for any reason or conduct she sees fit; she even announced in a staff meeting that she would do so even if she ""just wanted to."" We were reminded over possible wrong turn, mistake, or something she deemed threatening in demonstrating team-oriented behavior (as it was ""undermining"" and ""gaslighting"" her) that we are at-will employees. Anyway, she'd label and personally deliver the letter to your mailbox. Coworkers seem too comfortable/willing to talk to you? Letter. Too many appointments scheduled and TO requests? Letter. Unable to complete the inhuman amount of work she sprung on you last minute, in addition to the inhuman amount of work youare required to do daily? Letter. Voicing a workplace/safety/logistical concern? Letter. etc. etc. etc.

When she hired me, it was on the spot. She told me about her other staff and personal things like their divorces, etc. during the interview lmao. I was desperate so I accepted the position. She told me she was so relieved, as she had gone through 48 staff who had quit or been fired in matter of one year and can never find anyone ""normal"". This is a school with 6 teachers and 4-6 TAs on a typical day. Huge red flag. We didn't even have custodial staff. In the few months I worked there. about 4 were hired and quit. We took care of the custodial work and building maintenance, usually during nap time, after work, or literally whenever we could. If she saw so much as a scribble of crayon on a desk, it was a threatening letter and a meeting with the entire staff discussing YOUR error. So we spent a lot of time running around with magic erasers and spray bottles when we should have been engaging and teaching. My first staff meeting at this, in fact, was really her verbally attacking her employees while giving us slices of pizza -- insulting, telling us we should be grateful for all that she does for us. ""I had to take out a loan on my Mercedes to do payroll this week. And you think I do nothing for you."" like WHAT??!!! I don't own a car or know anything abt loans so I don't know what this means, but it sounds like a HER problem. She liked to name names during meetings, but she would also do a very dramatic stare whole saying things such as ""SOMEONE has been..."" or ""I was told SOMEONE said..."" or ""does SOMEONE have anything to say for themself?"" At that same fiest meeting she handed out worksheets and we had to calculate all of the expenses, etc. that she has to manage as a business owner. Then she said ""you should be thanking me.""

Anyway. One one particular day, I had more than I could handle. She was making her usual rounds and doing her usual thang and critiquing teachers and their classrooms. She happened to see a project I was working on with my students and was very upset that their handprint christmas trees made with paint were made with their hands facing up like this‚úãüèª as opposed to the other direction, facing downwards. They would not make for good advertising as they were done ""incorrectly."" We were required to do about 6 complete projects daily and take 200 pics of each student per month for online advertising -- THAT was our curricum. Mind you, I was assisting e-prek infants and leading a class of 2-3 year olds. She told me to find time to scrub the acrylic paint off of the cookie jars, start over, and have them completed by dismissal that afternoon. This was the last straw for me lol. On my break, I told her I was overwhelmed and felt that I could never reach her ever-shifting expectations. I then ran a few minutes late, after running it buy her, on my break as I needed to stop crying before returning to work. She then told me she was disgusted and disappointed in me, and that I ""endangered the lives of the children."" I was fired and not welcome to retrieve my things. After some texts and emails between us, she told me not to contact her. her business, her employees, or her students' families, and that once I returned my key to the building, she would give me my final paycheck and my classroom materials. I taped her key to the door of the school and the next day received an email that my check and belongings were in the parking lot for me to pick up, which I did.

Not sure if this is all context, me venting, or both. 

Anyway, I worked there from Oct-December 2021 and I have not received my tax information from this employer. Normally one should contact an employer for this info or get it through a payroll service. She asked me not to contact her and she does her own payroll -- so what do? Is it appropriate to skip the reaching-out-to-her step? lol

I feel like noting that this is not a Christian school, there were many ways in which the program was unsafe as a result of the owner's policies and choices, and that the owner is from the same community of origin as me (lower income, small, and relatively diverse community in the county we are currently in) -- which led to a very weird, classist and somewhat racist disdain for anything ""ghetto"" in the work culture. It was weird. A lot of school faculty/administration can be a bit Karen-esque but this employer and her few loyal employees were over the top.",1644503142.0
spcu8r,I work in a bar where we are now forbidden to eat meals.,3,0.81,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spcu8r/i_work_in_a_bar_where_we_are_now_forbidden_to_eat/,14,"Okay, so context: I work in a bar that has a restaurant attached to it. For the last two years we‚Äôve been allowed to have one free shift meal. However, we‚Äôve never been given meal breaks to eat this meal and have to do it in about 5 minutes as a barback watches the bar so we can go back to working our 6-13 hour shifts. Staff has always just put up with this because free food and the tips at this place are really good. 

Recently, however, we were notified that we cannot ever eat behind the bar during our shifts. (This makes sense as it‚Äôs a health code violation, but my coworker got in trouble for eating a jolly rancher when the place was empty.) So the jolly rancher has now led the owners to decide that not only are they going to take away our free meals from the restaurant, but that we are not allowed to EVER eat when we are clocked in. This means for shifts that range from 6 to 13 hours, we will not be able to eat anything. We will not be able to eat food we bring in, have delivered, or even pay for a meal at the restaurant we work in (because free shift meals have also been eliminated.) We are not allowed to have our legally required 30 minute meal breaks either. 

So I just wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any advice on what to do about this. I know what they‚Äôre doing is illegal, but I‚Äôm in NY, where filing any complaint with the department of labor has taken 1.5-5 years to even be addressed (I‚Äôve filed two complaints against prior restaurants in the past and neither have reached a resolution yet.)

Also, none of this has been put in writing. All employees are having verbal meetings with management about the new policies. So I‚Äôm really at a loss as to what can be done. I actually really like my job and the money is great. But I will be damned if they expect me to work 13 hours without eating a thing.",1644516423.0

I was written up for these abcenses, told I would be fired if I continued to miss work, and didn‚Äôt recieve our monthly bonus because of it. Is that legal (USA)?

Full story:

I have severe chronic migraines. I‚Äôve been seeing a neurologist for a few years now, and am trying to figure out how to manage them. Without treatment I was having headaches everyday with 3-4 migraines a week. With treatment I currently see ~2 a week. They typically start in the morning right before I wake up or 2-4pm, and more sporadically if certain triggers occur.

Because I‚Äôm new I can‚Äôt qualify for FMLA. So when a migraine occurs on a work day I miss part of the day but do work some that day, but rarely the full day. The time I‚Äôm miss is to migraines or dr appt is unpaid because we don‚Äôt have paid sick leave and minimal PTO.

When I‚Äôm out I notify my work before I need to be out, and let them know updates on when I will be coming in. My supervisor is not very understanding of this. I was asked if I would be willing to share health information so they could know what was going on. I offered to get written documentation of my condition and explained what migraines were and the medication I take to help prevent them.

They asked what could be changed to help reduce them. I mentioned that the office lighting was a trigger, I also said that a flexible work schedule or hybrid option would be beneficial. I noted that at a previous job being remote during COVID lock downs helped reduce the time I was out for migraines, and that integrating work from home days may help. My job can be done fully remote (and has been when coworkers tested positive or if weather is bad). When I‚Äôm in the office I almost never talk to others in person, almost all communication was on email or virtual meetings. The most interaction I have with people is passing them on the way to the bathroom. I asked if I could have a later starting and stoping time (30-60m later), or if I could possible work from home on migraine days to cut back on time on time that is spent on getting ready/commuting.

They asked if my doctor could make any treatment changes. I explained that limitations my current medications have and said that I could talk to my doctor about it but I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment for a couple of months because of the health backlog.

They said that a different start time wasn‚Äôt an option because the office is strict with its work times. They mentioned that I could possibly still work later in the evenings if I had a late day, but never followed up with getting me the security information I would need to stay. They also said that work from home was not preferred because of how our department is viewed by the rest of the company due to its traditional culture. They mentioned possibly having a single day at home until my appointment but that never fully happened. The bought a cover for my cube. They said that we‚Äôd check in after I met with my doctor.

During that time between my supervisor was very persistent in their concerns about me being absent. They asked if I had considered getting a piercing to help my migraines or if I had told my doctor how many migraines I get. They said they were shocked that someone as young as me could be this ill. They said that my absences impacted what we could achieve. They said my work quality is great and what they need but they want me to do more.

I disagreed about on my productivity, but didn‚Äôt say anything. My work has been consistent with deadlines and delays presented to be from my supervisor or other coworkers. Many of these delays come from my supervisor due to either poor communication from them or lack of response altogether. Issues that my other coworkers also have with this person. I told them that I understood their concerns and would have an update after my doctors appointment like we discussed.

My doctors appointment happened and a week after I was pulled into a meeting to see if there was improvement, and to also let me know that I was being written up for the amount of time I had missed because it violates the companies excessive absence code (that‚Äôs nonspecific about time). I was told that if they didn‚Äôt see a significant decrease in absensses within 30 days I would be terminated (which means no healthcare). Again they mentioned everything I did was great, they just wanted me in the office more. I also did not get our monthly bonus ($100) for the company hitting above sales estimates, because a write up dissqualifies you for that month.

I‚Äôve talked to my coworkers about it and that they disagree about it being an issue, saying that it had never been an issue for them and that I‚Äôve always been available when they needed me, and that I always get them what they need. They mentioned that they have also been having issues with supervisors expectations and critiques.

It‚Äôs very frustrating and I don‚Äôt want to have to find a new job.",1644509519.0

I‚Äôve been at my job for almost 2.5 years (minus the month I was laid off at the start of covid üôÉ). Some background: I‚Äôve never gotten benefits, pto, insurance, etc. and have always felt like I‚Äôve been underpaid. I get paid hourly and have gotten a total of $3/hr raise since I‚Äôve been here. There‚Äôs also been times where I‚Äôve been very much overworked and felt extremely burnt out, with no pto making it really hard to take a break for myself. I slowly started job hunting a few months after starting but with my mental health not being in the best place it‚Äôs been very challenging to work and job hunt full time. Over the past year I‚Äôve always started up an Etsy shop while wfh which has started becoming pretty successful. 

All of those factors finally lead me to deciding it was time. I gave my notice yesterday after a long day of nerves and expectedly they‚Äôre now trying to do anything to get me to stay (except of course give me any sort of benefits ü•≤). My boss told me how talented I was, how I was a part of their long term plans (which I haven‚Äôt heard until now), and how he‚Äôd love to try to adjust my salary to account for insurance and pto (which I guess I would still have to figure out?). I stood my ground though and told him my last day. My other boss emailed me this morning with a similar sentiment saying how they all really really don‚Äôt want to lose me and I would always be welcome back.

som53u,Not going to give me the promotion? Fine I'm gone.,215,0.98,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/som53u/not_going_to_give_me_the_promotion_fine_im_gone/,24,"I'm a hard working 34 year old woman. I was employed at a non profit for about 3 years. It wasn't the best job or the best paying job, but I liked all my coworkers and I liked that I was helping the community. One day the marketing person is moving onto another job, this guy was old school, did things like put print ads in newspapers and actually recorded and put an ad on TV. I was excited because I thought I was a no brainer to take his place after he left. I have a degree in New Media and Graphic Design and have extensive knowledge in video editing software, animation and game design. As well I knew the in and out of the company. I had also gone above and beyond in my job, helping the marketing department with new media projects, getting videos on youtube, sound editing / cleanup, making an interactive training program in Unity, and more.

I put in for the job and an interview gets set up. Everyone on my team is excited to have me as the new marketing person! Everyone thinks that this whole interview is mostly a formality. I do my interview and even do a presentation on how we can modernize our business for little to no costs, how we can do work with VR to help our clients and excite donors to get more funding. The interview goes a full 2 hours over with the hiring community asking a ton of questions. It seems the hiring committee is excited about everything I was saying! Well everyone but one lady, let's call her Karen, a 40 something, rich, board member, who is just sitting there silently. I don't think that there is a problem, maybe Karen is just taking it all in.

Two weeks goes by and I'm informed by the head of HR (A friend of mine) that I didn't get the job. I was crushed, I had been working so hard and was excited to make the non profit the best it could be. So I ask HR who was hired?  She says, ""Well, no one actually."" Wait what? So it seems they offered the job to a Middle aged white guy, who after getting the offer turned it down because he got a better offer someplace else. So I ask well why am I not getting the job? Turns out Karen said that if they just keep me in my current position I'll still do all the work I was doing and they won‚Äôt need to pay me as much as if I got the marketing job. So I probably would never get promoted as long as Karen has any say in the matter.

So I say, F this and tell HR that I'm going to be looking for other work because I got screwed over hard and this is not cool. Then I tell my boss that I'm doing my job to the letter, I'm no longer going above or beyond, not helping any other departments with projects, etc. and I let them know that it's because if there is no room for growth and if I'm stuck in this job this is all the work they are getting out of me. I immediately start sending out resumes and taking vacation and sick days to go to interviews. After about 6 weeks of this I land a job at an amazing mobile game company as a game designer. The work is way more fun, takes half the energy and I get a x2.5 pay bump!

I talked to my HR friend a few days ago and Karen has been back from maturity leave for a few months now and shocker they can't find anyone to replace me in my old position, nor can they find anyone qualified for the marketing job. Everyone that worked with me is so pissed about the situation and still says things like ""Shame \_\_\_ isn't here to do that."" or ""You know who could have had this solved this in five seconds? \_\_\_\_."" or ""Does anyone know how to do this now that \_\_\_\_ is gone?""

sph3gk,It's gonna keep sucking forever,2,0.63,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sph3gk/its_gonna_keep_sucking_forever/,6,"Out the door, I'm a small business owner.  Due to the nature of my business we can't fully transition to a worker co-op, but we do full profit sharing and unlimited PTO (just started that this year).

I work 7 days a week, even when I get a day off I can't be more than ten minutes away from the shop in case someone gets sick or an emergency pops up.  I've had to cut appointments short, cancel plans, and just give up on having ANY life outside of work.  We can't afford to close the doors, we can't afford to lose any momentum in growth or we're going to drop off and fail.  And if we fail, that's a bunch of people that lose a job that provides a living wage, and a real chance for them to have a future.

Plenty of posts here oversimplify this: If I can't afford to run a successful business, I have no rights to be running one.  But, how many of the people posting those have run businesses?  Let alone profitable ones that have survived for nearly a decade, providing *living wages* *to all employees*.  We're not printing money, and we aren't the only fish in the pond competing for limited resources.  It honestly doesn't mean any difference at all to my customers that my staff is taken care of.  *Literally* no one gives a shit, so we can only stay afloat by our own merits.  We're god damned great at our jobs (my staff are fucking amazing, and, they don't burn out, but, I definitely am nothing but smoldering ash).

We're small, and in an industry where bigger chains are just starting to devour the market.  We can't compete with their pricing, they can buy in orders of magnitude more volume, and suppress their worker's pay to minimum wage.  And there's no winning against them.  As a consumer, price and convenience are the single greatest determining factors in picking which shop someone goes to.  We can offer superb customer service, full maintenance and warranties, and even give out freebies/loaners/etc... to help people when they're short.  But, none of that really matters, it only barely keeps us floating when the shop down the street sells for 5% less.

They don't give a shit that they have to rotate through staff constantly.  They don't train their staff to answer questions about products or troubleshoot problems.  Hell, the staff there are so fucking drained and disillusioned that I've never seen them happy, and that almost seems like a selling point to some of the sadistic fucking customers out there.  Some huge fucking number of you (all people, not just specifically antiwork), are fucking abominable humans that take sick satisfaction in seeing we servile plebs miserable in our tasks.

And that seems to be the end goal.  Drive every smaller business out, eliminate every single entry level job that pays a living wage, and keep the working class as enslaved consumers that can only subsist by purchasing at the very companies that drove them into poverty.  Whether you're going to admit/accept it doesn't fucking matter, you are in a class war, and not picking a side is the complacency that your oppressors have engineered and are counting on.

If you really want better workplaces, start campaigning for real fucking change, or start making noise and protesting.  Monopolies are being encouraged, and they are immensely destructive to the average quality of life, fucking do something or watch the world get incrementally worse while you work yourself to death.

Or, fucking tear it down.  Organize in numbers like the fuckwit truckers in Ottawa, and make the simple but effective ultimatum.  Change through reform, or revolution.

Bottom line, stop fucking expecting the world to change, stop thinking that the small business owner that's clearing about the same as you per year, with the entirety of their life's work as collateral, is your enemy in a system that's oppressing both of you.  End capitalism, or, at least end monopolies if you're a fan of half-measures.",1644527202.0

John is a baker, Jim is a butcher and Joe is candlestick maker and they all get to meet in the town square of their local village to set prices and negotiate the value of their own labor. Sounds great, right? What could be bad about a system like that right?

Nothing really. Under those conditions and those assumptions, capitalism and free markets are one of the greatest things to happen to mankind. The problem is those conditions and assumptions no longer match reality in the age of technology and automation.

John and Jim have had their bakeries and butcher shops put out of business by grocery stores and now work for them directly with the value of their individual tradecraft marginalized by machines that allow for mass production of quality goods by people needing a fraction of the training once required. Joe, unfortunately, is homeless now, because there hasn't been a need for a dedicated candlemaker as an essential tradecraft since they became mass produced by factories. 

All of three of these people are examples of the philosophical change of companies which has been occurring over the last half a century. Instead of taking their profits and reinvesting them into the work force in an attempt to attract the most skilled workers to boost productivity and quality, companies are investing their profits into technology designed to increase productivity and quality while reducing the training and talent required by their workforce to perform said jobs. This has created a massive jolt in the productivity of the workforce while creating a stagnation in wages.

This divergence in productivity and compensation began in the 1970s and is often attributed to the dissolution of the gold standard and the beginning of unhindered printing of the U.S. dollar. While I don't doubt this plays into it, this is also the time period when computer technology truly began to take off with 1968 being the year of the invention of the first modern computer, 1969 containing the birth of UNIX, 1970 birthing the first DRAM chip, 1971 creating the floppy disk drive and 1972 presenting the first home game console.

Technological advancement and it's effect on the value of labor is now starting to reach it's crescendo with automation now beginning to replace the need for workers entirely instead of simply reducing the value of their labor. 

Is this a bad thing? No, it's not. A human being spending their life working on the floor of a Tyson chicken factory as a cog in a machine is an awful existence and it's better replaced by a new machine which can be the missing cog in the machine.

It is, however, a bad thing in a system which ties the distribution of resources to the common man as a function of his or her labor. Many will argue that the old jobs will be replaced by new jobs servicing the machines and working with the technology, but yet this is not a very realistic stance. If the new system was able to provide enough jobs working with machines in order to ensure our entire population had enough labor to acquire the resources they needed, it would defeat the purpose of building machines to do work for us in the first place.

Yet, despite this growing issue, we have only had one presidential candidate who made this a serious part of his campaign. That was Andrew Yang. His idea that was dubbed Universal Basic Income by the media was actually an attempt to redistribute the benefits of this increased productivity from globalism and technology back down to the common man who was finding his labor increasingly devalued in a system that required labor to acquire resources.

Despite this, he was considered a joke candidate by many and was ignored by many people who are participating in this subreddit today with their votes going to candidates who still don't even recognize this as an issue and maintain a view in which the value of labor was the same as it was in 1920.

The point of my post here to day is to shed light on this issue and to help people understand that mass striking and resignation of jobs to force wages up will only get so far in a system that increasingly does not need our labor anymore.

The old adage of ""Work hard and you will be rewarded"" doesn't work when all profits are going towards the creation of technology designed to reduce the need for hard work, the very thing tied to the distribution of rewards in the system itself.

In the next election, please consider voting for a candidate who is making this issue a central part of his campaign.

Thank you.",1644451418.0

The idea of being in a work environment again makes me insanely anxious. Every time I think about going back to work my stomach just sinks. I had a horrible, traumatic experience at my last job, which was also my first ever job. I was treated like complete shit by both management and coworkers just for being trans and autistic. I was denied the same opportunities as my coworkers because they ""didn't trust me"" despite not even seeing me work in those positions and constantly confined to the same spaces that people who had just started working there were assigned to even when I had been there for more than 6 months. In addition to that, I was literally bullied by multiple people, including a manager. For the first few months I was at that job almost everybody talked shit about me behind my back and spread rumors about me due to me being trans. I was constantly misgendered. One of my coworkers even fucking quit as soon as I got hired just because she didn't want to work alongside me due to me being trans. This continued for 4 months up until I finally reported one of my coworkers and she ended up fired. 

It was just extremely horrible all around. I'm grateful for the few friends I made there but the experience literally fucking traumatized me. I can't even think about going back there, even just to watch a movie, without feeling sick. Right after I quit I didn't feel this way but I've fully processed all of the traumatic things that happened while I was there and it's just completely ruined my attitude towards working. I don't understand why this kind of behavior is allowed, especially in a supposedly ""professional"" environment and ESPECIALLY towards someone who was a minor at the time. 

And that's bled over into my attitude towards work as a whole now. I don't want to start at a new job only to have the same exact experience with my coworkers and managers again.

soyemt,Why Micromanagers Ruin Talent,28,0.97,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/soyemt/why_micromanagers_ruin_talent/,11,"So, I work for a company that services a major retailer. We stock certain products on the shelves, and reset certain areas when inventory needs to be moved. 

I have been here since the store opened. I've got a good rapport with the employees. We stay out of each other's way, and there have been very few issues. I generally write my own schedule, and part of my job description is that I'm supposed to act independently and adjust the order of tasks as needed. One of the interesting things about my job is that each task has an ""estimated completion time"". So I might have a 4 hour, two 2 hour tasks, and a couple 1 hours in a given shift (I work 10 hour days by choice). 

I'm lazy. I don't believe in working hard, I believe in working smart. I was very clear about this when I interviewed. I look for ways to make my job easier and more efficient. As a result of this, my store has one of the highest on-time completion rate. 
But here's the secret. If a task is supposed to take 4 hours, and I finish it in 2, I take the next 2 hours to mess around (my Switch sees a lot of use). It's not like the store or my company loses money, they've already agreed on the rate/time. And I see no reason to push myself beyond the scope of my assigned tasks. I'm not looking for a promotion (I'm finishing college and have ZERO interest in moving up in the company), so being an ""exceptional worker"" has no value to me. I do what I'm contracted to do, no more, no less.

My previous manager got moved to a store closer to home, which is great for them. Im genuinely happy for them. The new manager sent out an email this week that basically read ""I'm going to write the schedule. You WILL follow it. If a task takes less time than projected, I expect you to accurately report it."" There was more, but thats the pertinent bits.

So, okay. Guess what? No task is ever going to be finished early. All you've managed to accomplish is make me dissatisfied with you as a manager. I cannot comprehend why managers think insisting on thus sort of thing is ever going to have a positive effect...
Also, I'm not going to tell you that your schedule is doomed to fail, as you've failed to account for certain store conditions. Store conditions I could have informed you about had you consulted with me instead assuming you know best. You'll have no one to blame but yourself when things don't work out. I'm sure you'll try to blame me, but that won't work. My record shows that I do just fine on my own.

It's going to be an interesting week...

spb0ln,I was fired to preserve a coworker‚Äôs ego,3,0.72,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spb0ln/i_was_fired_to_preserve_a_coworkers_ego/,5,"For ~7 months, until last Thursday (technically Monday), I worked a 12hr shift factory job. I would love to name it but they only have one plant in my state and I‚Äôd rather not doxx myself. Like with every job until now, I became the well known ‚Äúyes man‚Äù there, and the one to push all extra tasks onto. There was never a complaint about me and I never complained about anyone else despite being borderline harassed by all around terrible people.

I had coworkers who snuck off the bathroom to do drugs. One ended up breaking her arm on shift and refusing to go to the hospital just so she didn‚Äôt have to do a drug test (it was honestly pretty impressive). A coworker who watched porn while working machines. A coworker who openly bragged about baby trapping a minor. A coworker who cussed out another coworker over not being allowed to borrow a broken fan; she was simply moved to a more well ventilated area. A coworker who split her arm open because she wasn‚Äôt wearing safety gear and was rewarded with a promotion to ‚ÄúHead of Safety‚Äù. 

Towards me, I was constantly taken advantage of by coworkers who belittled me. I had to leave early Once because my brother got in a nearly fatal car crash. When I came back the next day someone asked what my emergency was. I told him and the guy said ‚Äúmy brother died and I had the common decency to finish my shift. Now come ‚Äòere and break out my girlfriend we need a cigarette‚Äù. That guy and another lady I‚Äôll call C (the one whose ego I was fired to protect) forced me to go in a machine that wasn‚Äôt locked out once because they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel like waiting for maintenance‚Äù. Him, C, and ~5 other people are all friends from the same class at the local high school who still haven‚Äôt realized school ended 20+ years ago. Most things are set to cater to their group. When C is mean (all the time), 6 other people are ready to jump in to say ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just like that it‚Äôs just the way she is‚Äù.

Well, last Thursday, I was put with two new coworkers (their 3rd day, my first working with them). One was C‚Äôs daughter. The other was some girl (B) who looks like she belongs on a white couch with a couple teal pillows. She openly refused to follow ANY rules; she must have sucked a dick or brought proof of a DNA match in management to get in because even the shift supervisor folded after a couple minutes of trying to get her to follow protocol. Just said ‚Äúfine, do it how you want just for today‚Äù and walked away. 

She was already rude, which in itself whatever, but she took this as ‚ÄúI am above you‚Äù and started acting accordingly. There were two stations and she chose to work with me just to be able to push my buttons. She was snatching stuff from me, ransacking my work station, calling me a bitch, and at the end of it didn‚Äôt even get anything done. As always I kept my head down and worked‚Ä¶ Until the last snatching straw (4th time) where I told her to get her own station if she was gonna act like a bitch in mine. 

It was the first time I‚Äôd ever snapped at work so I went to step outside and then give C a scheduled break. I was ~15 minutes early for it so I briefly explained with ‚Äúsorry, I got a little heated at my station and came to see if you wanted a break‚Äù. She went OFF on me about ‚Äúyou better not be talking about my daughter, that [other] girl‚Äôs my daughter and I don‚Äôt want to hear a single word‚Äù etc etc. I just said ‚Äúoh no no, I don‚Äôt have a problem with her. I had a little problem with the other one but it‚Äôs fine‚Äù. C said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being way too argumentative, I‚Äôm going to tell the supervisor about your attitude issue‚Äù.

As always, her 5 minute break was a 20 minute and lo and behold at the end of it, the entirety of upper management comes to walk me to the offices. I‚Äôm sat down in a conference room with B and C. C straight up LIES about what I said to her (‚Äúoh she came over cussing up a storm‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt use any profanity with C). B sugarcoats it to shit kicking it off with ‚Äúfirst of all, I am so sorry you guys have to be dealing with this so early in the morning. I hope you can continue to have a relaxing day soon‚Äù. I gave my side of the story and C even said ‚Äú‚Ä¶ well yeah, that does sound pretty accurate. BUT I didn‚Äôt like the attitude. I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt care what else happened‚Äù.

They said they would look into the issue, had me write a statement, and sent (only) me home. I was told I‚Äôd receive a call with their decision the next day (Friday). I was supposed to come back Monday at 7am, so on Sunday when I hadn‚Äôt heard anything I texted my boss to ask if I was good to come back. She said she‚Äôd get in touch with the plant manager as soon as she could. Monday at 10am, I get a call. They say they ‚Äúthink it‚Äôs best to relieve me from my assignment, but I‚Äôll get no bad recommendation from them and I‚Äôm a great worker who they‚Äôre sure will have no problem finding another job‚Äù. 

If I‚Äôm such a great worker, why fire me? Using profanity once? Then why not fire the girl who used it first on top of refusing to follow any of your precious protocol? Why not fire the lady who cussed out an old woman because she couldn‚Äôt borrow a fan that ended up being broken? Firing me was the only way to keep C happy when she claimed her ego had been affronted, and still haven‚Äôt ruled out my earlier theories about B‚Äôs employment. My boyfriend still works there and said B and C were transferred to work together. 

Either way, they were willing to risk two people‚Äôs entire livelihood on preserving the ego of one terrible employee and another good but consistently very rude one. I‚Äôm now jobless because my company bent over for someone who openly refuses to follow rules and someone else who pretends to be incapable of basic human decency/throws a temper tantrum if they convince themselves someone else is acting the same way. 

But hey, I get a good recommendation from them. Lucky me.",1644511773.0

I have chosen to work for this company because COVID hit the former industry I was involved with pretty hard.

I absolutely love what the company stands for and has to offer. Securing a new job during these unprecedented times was really important to me.

Upon applying I didn‚Äôt necessarily ask for a bigger wage than what I was earning back then because the work-life balance and the extras provided made up for it. I figured I would just work hard to earn any raise I would be asking in the future.

Fast forward to one year later : my evaluation was the best I have ever gotten, I am meeting or exceeding all expectations and have also successfully taken over some extra responsibilities (which I am happy about in order to further develop my skills and help build my case).

When I requested a raise (without mentioning a figure) my direct manager fully understood why and told me he‚Äôd speak to HR (as it appears such things have to run through them).

Their feedback went along the lines of:
- Wth he is already asking for a raise?
- Does he know he can earn some extra money on a monthly basis based off his performances (note:it‚Äôs like 20$ max)
- Does he know his salary will be slightly raised on a regular basis?

This made me so mad because they are absolutely clueless about what I do in my job, how well I executed it, the added value I bring and the additional responsibilities I have taken over.
They are literally hiding themselves behind excuses to not look into it at all and are indirectly telling me: work as hard as you want, there is no such thing as rewarding hard working people around here. Be average at best, we don‚Äôt care.

I am now exploring two options:
- GTFO and never work for a state-owned company again
- Wait a bit for the COVID situation to improve even further, work on my skill set as much as possible and look for something else later this year",1644519253.0

Secondly, if I do wish to leave, I can leave right away. But I'll have to pay my dad back X amount for work clothes and other bits. This means I'll have to work for atleast 4 to 6 weeks to get my first paycheck to pay him back.

Beale:¬†I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.

We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!

We all know things are bad -- worse than bad --¬†they're crazy.

It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, ""Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.""

Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.

I want you to get mad!

I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.

All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.

You've gotta say, ""I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!""

So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

and I'm not going to take this anymore!!""",1644479419.0

Long story short: I, the only full-time 100% remote person on my team, finally had the opportunity to speak candidly to a fellow team member about our boss's abusive behavior. I had no idea any one was experiencing the same thing I was. Our boss is a fake southern nice person, who regularly belittles us and since she has decided she doesn't like us both has essentially stopped giving us work but little ""projects"" that are pointless and regularly leave us with no feedback or results from our work. My team member called to ask about a project that he's working on that I essentially completed last week. So I sent him my final project but that led us to talk. Our boss displays clear favoritism, he's confirmed that everyone (including those she favorites) hate them, and that he's also suffered verbal abuse from them. The only difference is when they did it to me via email and slack, I gave them a freaking tongue lashing over zoom and reported them to HR. they haven't been outright rude to me in awhile because of it. So he's suffering a little more from that than me. They tell us consistently that we should look at other companies and jobs too. But we also figured something out, they love trauma dumping on us. All the personal issues they are going through and regularly tells both of us in our 1:1s, and mind you most of their bad behavior happens when they are interacting with us individually and is a little (but not much) covert when in a group (I guess they consistently tell my team member in meetings that they knows he's afraid of them Infront of other people under the guise of a ""joke""). I told him to do what I do and just do what's asked and not a thing more and keep collecting that paycheck. He was in shock but I pointed out I have been with the company longer than most of the team including manager. I also told him to send all his notes on their interactions to HR because they already have a few complaints thanks to yours truly. 

But my real question is, since they keep regularly trauma dumping on us and doing other toxic behavior, could we tell HR that we fear they are  not mentally well enough to continue leading the team since they keep taking it out on us and mistreating us a clear result of their ""issues"" both at home and in the workplace?",1644514686.0

sp4lyg,New commune initiative in Europe,5,0.7,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sp4lyg/new_commune_initiative_in_europe/,4,"We (a group of 7 currently) would like to create a commune somewhere in the southern Europe (Galicia looks like a good place). I suppose this initiative may be relevant for people here.

The commune is to be built on the following premise: recreating society based on the scientific method, principles commonly accepted in science and open debate in order to maximise fulfilment and wellbeing of a human life.

The above-mentioned premise is the only thing that commune members should agree with. Everything else is to be derived from the premise. However, a commune member should also be open-minded as decision making is based on respectful debates. So be ready to debate on the topics of egalitarianism, antinatalism, veganism, anticapitalism, environmentalism, etc.

The reason for wanting to make a shared value system based on the premise is that one of the reasons why communes fail seems to be heterogeneity in values. With the proposed method we expect to solve that issue because people tend to do things that they find to be right if there are no obstacles. The reason why we have many different stances on things is because people may think that their stance is correct or someone else's stance is wrong because they based it on a different premise, have different information or a fault in logic. We took into account those three.

The currently proposed government/economic model aims at reducing the amount of work we need to do, so seems relevant to the subreddit.

**Government/economic model**

No money or private property (to a sensible degree) in the commune. A non-profit organisation (NPO) with commune premise as its goal will be established that is going to own all assets and handle monetary interactions with the outside world. Commune members will be voting on all expenses that are going to be done by the NPO. The vote should be unanimous. If not, an open debate will be held until everyone agrees.

For-profit companies (FPCs) will be created in order to get money from the outside world. FPC should not require members to leave the community (or at least they must agree). The work that has to be done will be kept at minimum (no 40 hour work weeks). Members vote on what FPCs are established and how they operate. Example: a software development company (or some other remote work company), where commune members volunteer to do work. Instead of hiring workers, companies can hire our FPC (no need to pay social tax, multiple people instead of one).

Members are responsible for ensuring prosperity of the commune. Required jobs will be agreed upon together and posted for anyone to perform. Every member decides themselves how much they work and what they do.

By doing some calculations it seems that each member will have to work to earn money only for 8 h per week when all required assets are bought taking into account an equivalent of a median salary brought by each member.

**Slack workspace**

It‚Äôs dumb, because I know the schedule wasn‚Äôt written yet.

I‚Äôm cool with working any other holiday. But V-Day? I hate this stupid ‚Äúholiday‚Äù. It‚Äôs just commercialism for corporations to profit drain people.

If you‚Äôre in a relationship, you should love and take care of your partner EVERYDAY, not just one day of the calendar year.

Even Christmas is commercialized, but it at least has an important meaning behind it (both from a religious POV and not religious).

It‚Äôs bad enough having to see couples in a relationship on a daily basis, it hurts me. But an entire day ALL ABOUT IT???

At Kroger, they make everything a big deal. All it is for the corporation is about money, just like everything else. They want me there to help because it‚Äôs busy, guess what? I care more about myself than that, even though I hate myself and don‚Äôt really care about myself.

I don‚Äôt want to be around other people on that day, I want to lock myself in my room and be by myself. 

They‚Äôll probably want me to go help in that tent, to make things even worse. Weirdly it didn‚Äôt bother me the last few years (that I can remember) but I guess I was just still more hopeful that there was hope for me to have a loving girlfriend, and more hopeful about life in general.

I already told supervisor I have a doctor appointment on that day (I don‚Äôt). They said since the schedule is already written, I‚Äôd have to switch shifts with someone. The people I asked today already work on V-Day.

If I call in sick, they‚Äôll know I‚Äôm faking now. If I stick to the ‚Äúdoctors appointment‚Äù, and insist I can‚Äôt go in, they might try to make me either come in for a few hours later, or provide a doctor note.

I hate that my life has even come to this point, I‚Äôm too old for this (job and life circumstances ending me up here) but exposing myself to all the people who can actually get into relationships won‚Äôt be some ‚Äúexposure therapy‚Äù for me, it‚Äôll only put me in a 1000x worse mindset and mood.

I really don‚Äôt even care if I get written up, I‚Äôve never been written up and you get 3 before termination, right? I kind of want to be fired, but I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do next, so I‚Äôd really rather not get fired.

Like, if I call in or insist I CANNOT miss my doctor appointment, and I don‚Äôt provide a doctor note (unless my doctor can write one even though I‚Äôm not actually seeing them at this time) what‚Äôs the worst that‚Äôll happen to me?

I‚Äôm trying to keep the concept of ‚Äúromantic and sexual‚Äù relationships out of my mind, I‚Äôm trying to suppress my desire for that from any women, because I‚Äôm ugly and work at Kroger (bagging and pushing carts, even worse).

I seriously might have some kind of outburst or meltdown, it‚Äôs just too much to keep bottled up.

I don‚Äôt really care about this job that much, it‚Äôs dead end, for years on end they‚Äôll keep you at the bottom, and there is really no level that is really great. I‚Äôd rather be dead anyway, I feel if I quit or get fired I might have to seriously be ready to end my life, because I can‚Äôt seem to do better and I can‚Äôt deal with the consequences, whether my situation is my fault or not.

I‚Äôm not just an employee, I‚Äôm an effing human being, even though I don‚Äôt really feel like one.",1644527700.0
