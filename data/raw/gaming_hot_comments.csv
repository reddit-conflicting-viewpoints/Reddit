The combat transitions are seamless and I really appreciated it.  I like the option of being able to choose to engage (or to run), and how there's no long transition in and out of battle.  

The combat system itself has a few flaws in my opinion.  I feel like status effects have really been nerfed and I tend to mostly brute force my way through fights.  The game telling you what moves are effective and not is convenient, but also dumbs down the game a little bit and makes you not have to have an encyclopedic knowledge of pokemon types and ideal matchups.  I kind of miss the lack of trainer battles from previous games.

The storyline isn't doing much for me, it feels contrived and doesn't always make sense, but that's a pretty standard thing for a Pokemon game and fans should know that by now.

The actual meat and potatoes of the game though, the exploring and collecting and filling out the pokedex (nice twist by the way with the different research tasks), that's where the real fun in the game lies.

- move options were absolutely gutted (removed ~500 from the previous game, iirc. Only ~170 moves now).

- no trainer battles (outside of a few battles with scripted/story characters who only have ~3 Pok√©mon). But, definitely no victory road haha

- no gyms

- gym replacements (mini-boss battles) are just dodge, spam throw infinite balls, dodge, spam throw infinite balls, throw Pok√©mon, weaken the boss, spam throw infinite balls, win. Hilariously barebones combat compared to BotW‚Äôs mini-boss battles

- story is a huge step from normal Pok√©mon games, but, it‚Äôs not comparable at all to a game like HZD, BotW, or even any of the Assassins Creed games. Hell, it‚Äôs *miles* behind something simple like Genshin Impact‚Äôs story.

- lack of voice acting and almost complete lack of character animation during their ‚Äúacting‚Äù scenes is super off putting. Just standing there bobbing a little while text scrolls is super low effort. Might as well have made them static scenes.

- never need to worry about potions/pokeballs/revives as everything is super easy to craft just by hitting trees and rocks and picking plants

- enemy AI is nearly nonexistent. Pok√©mon barely even stumble around.

##**However**

- I love the transversal options (horse, boat, glider, climber reskinned to Pok√©mon is a great idea). Unfortunate you can‚Äôt fly between regions like in previous games. You have to go back to starter base town then to the other region.

- I love Alpha Pok√©mon. Super cool having these much stronger Pok√©mon just plopped around the map. Kinda treat them like Lynel from BotW to farm XP or seeds of mastery.

- I know some don‚Äôt, but I really like Pok√©mon being outside of grass. I skipped Let‚Äôs Go, so this was new for me. It‚Äôs nice not getting surprised randomly when walking through grass.

Rework the game. Make double battles the standard. No, you're wrong if you think single battles are the real Pokemon.

Make routes big, like, Wild Area in basic Sword and Shield big, maybe bigger. Make them feel open world like the area did, but add loads of stuff. Add puzzles, add lore, add items, add secret wild Pokemon, add cool trainer battles with cool strategies.

Give interactions to the Pokemon in the overworld. You find a wild flock of Delibirds. You could run in and murder them for XP or catch them traditionally, or you could sit down in front of them, tempt them to be curious and get close to you. Feed them a berry.

Then it flies off, and later on you might find another flock of Delibird, you do the same again and you find the same Delibird. It now wants to join your team. Shit like this is the dream.

Give us sanctuaries Animal Crossing / Pallet Town style where we can let our Pokemon roam freely.

Especially since Pokemon's formula + an open world setting is an interesting concept that hasn't been explored before, and as Legends Arceus shows, it has a fun gameplay loop that they could go further with if they wanted to.

Believe it or not (just exclude the graphics) it's a game made with love and care. The quests, the pokemon, the experience from exploring have a whole lot of attention to detail that will go over most players. Pokemon Lore have been massively taken into account here. Example: Nosepass always looks North, because that's what it really does, based on a Pokedex entry from several games. The the kind of attention to detail that will go over people's heads, ESPECIALLY Pokemon Haters that will never even consider the game in the 1st place. And that's just one example. Side Quests, Pokemon Behaviors actually uses the lore set by previous Pokemon games here. There's a sidequest that references a book form the Diamond and Pearl games, a book that talks about an ancient legend. Well, the game doesn't hand hold you in the side quests, tthey give you a vague description, and you're on your own to find it out, no map markers, no anything. You figure it out yourself. And a whole lot of sidequests would make sense if you actually read Pokemon Lore. Again, this will obviously go over Pokemon hater's heads, because it is very intricate details only Pokemon fans will know.

The game is vastly oversimplified by people who put it off just cause it is a Pokemon game or the graphics suck. So yes, it is worth my 60 bucks, most 60 bucks games don't have that kind of attention to detail. I have more enjoyment from this game from most 60 bucks games.

 My problem with the weapons is that you aren't allowed to specialize in them because they have shallow movepools and break in combat. The samey enemies you face are widely defeated by mashing the attack button and doing a timed dodge save for the moments you want to shoot them with a bow. Fun does not equal complex. Throwing things is DEFINITELY fun.

None of this is miles ahead of a game like Skyrim (which again, I don't even like because of floaty combat) which came out forever ago and is on the smart fridge now. 

It is okay for a game to not have groundbreaking new features and crazy complex combat. I loved the puzzles in the shrines

What is not okay, is pretending that something is groundbreaking. Frankly, it insults the hard working devs of other companies who have already done that and more. What it does, it works at. But it is a simple action adventure game. We've seen this before, and arguably done better elsewhere.

Being Geralt is comprehensive. You gotta chug the CAT lmao and actually level and have skills like a proper rpg should. And Gwent of course everyone loves gwent but see the next point for the jist of what I'm saying.

My point was that the scope of those other games far exceeds what BotW managed as an openworld sandbox. These games have crazy voicework done in them and lore and actual questing. Huge distinct environments designed painstakingly by some really overworked gals and gents. These games are monuments to hard work and creative inspiration as *A Complete Package*. Comprehensively, the plot, bosses, world-building, and characters of these games dwarfs what is presented in BotW in both effort, and execution. 

And that should be fine. I'm just not in the business of pretending that a game isn't just the sum of its parts. I hate skyrim's vanilla gameplay but I appreciate and love the work that went into those skill trees, modability of the game itself intended, and overall design of encounters and quests.

In short, because all moves act at the instance they are picked, this removes all play based on countering what the opponent would have picked. You don‚Äôt notice this during PvE because Pok√©mon AI hardly responds to your own actions, but here is a short list of things that are just largely invalidated by the new turn system.

(1) You could never pivot into/through Pok√©mon that take no damage (e.g. ghost to absorb a normal type attack), because the enemy would see that and just use a different move.

(2) In that vein, using protect would just never make sense, since if an opponent sees you protected, the would just do something else.

(3) Priority moves, instead of catching the opponent off guard, speed up your turn economy. This prevents Pok√©mon from being able to gain a burst of momentum to prevent the opponent from doing something else (such as fake out), as opposed to having a turn of vulnerability for greater gains down the road.

(4) Trick room just doesn‚Äôt work under the current system. This means a lot of strong, slow Pok√©mon are just a lot less viable. You could just rework trick room‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs subject to a good implementation which no one knows what that would look like and how it would affect Pok√©mon of that type.

TL;DR If playing against an intelligent opponent, a lot of different strategies and counter play just don‚Äôt exist.

Bad point, mate. Skyrim's combat isn't great, but at least every time I replay Skyrim I can try out something new and different. Which is what makes it fun: the variety.

Playing as an archer is not the same as playing as a sword-and-board, which is not the same as playing as a wizard.

And the great thing about Skyrim is you're not locked into a single option: you can dabble in whatever you want. Mix-and-match weapons and spells to your liking.

I'm thinking we'll continue to see incremental changes and good stuff. Legends selling so well ensures it's going to be continued in some way in the future. Maybe even the BW Unova region with the original Kyurem dragon thingy as the back in time plot? Idk but we'll get something right?

I think the issue isn't money; it's Game Freak. It doesn't matter how much money they throw at them if they don't have the skill to use it. Game Freak has been coasting for decades off the success of Pokemon while only having to make simple(graphically at least, while any complexity in the gameplay and world design is more or less the same as it has been since the Gameboy games came out in 1996) portable games. Now they're forced to develop for a real console and don't have the experience. If you look at the Pokemon games they've developped on Switch it's clear they're learning, but they're learning as they go and are basically releasing their practice projects as full games.

Add to that the fact that Game Freak has strict release schedules to adhere to because the entire franchise stems from these games and you end up with a recipe for mediocre and repetitive titles. We can only hope they're doing what they need to behind the scenes to alleviate these issues like expanding their teams so they can actually use more resources to make the games in the future.

Arceus is divisive for reasons a lot of poeple have said already. As Pokemon fans it's exciting to see the series finally making leaps forward instead of baby steps or ""two steps forward, one step back,"" and the game *is* fun. On the other hand, despite the forward progress, they're still a decade out of date compared to modern titles and that just isn't good enough.",5,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,1644540115.0

You have to be so friggin blind to believe otherwise but everyone on this subreddit just parrots ‚Äúduuuurrrrr no veeeedio game violence harm u moron‚Äù like ITS NOT FUCKING OBVIOUS. 

Whatever, throw the culture in the garbage I barely care anymore but stop acting like it‚Äôs true that they aren‚Äôt damaging. Especially when it‚Äôs based purely on your belief that an addictive unproductive violent activity is healthy for children. 

Which I‚Äôm sure many of you have *fucking eyeroll*

Obviously it doesn't make you violent, of course you see worse on TV. Things get more complicated now that we have multiplayer, especially in this series. After playing GTA Online quite a bit it must be said.

If I found out my kid was one of these punk-ass cheating bitches I would lose my shit on them. Many kids will have irreparable damage to their social development playing some of these online games. Lets say you play GTA Online, you're a cheater and all you do for ""fun"" is ride around with Godmode on killing people who cannot fight back and when they get mad you crash them to desktop.

Spoiler alert  - You're going to have trouble in real life if this is fun for you. You have developmental issues that will now impact you in countless ways. Forget the violence, this is much more damaging.

I would rather find out my kid was smoking crack than find out they are one of these kids. It's  one step from poking and teasing animals for fun, its a red flag for phycologists. As a gamer AND a father, this upcoming generation is going to struggle because of this. not the violence. If you have friends who game like this encourage them to change, find fun in teamwork, helping people,  because it is going to cause long-term physiological damage if they find antagonizing and taunting enjoyable.

The playtest should be free - do yourself a favor and try it. I downloaded it as a joke and cause I was bored and ended up putting in like 30 hours over the course of a few days cause it was just that damn good.

if the entire game was Conquest mode, no one would ever NOT complain.

Move with cover, even if it takes longer, stay together, move with armor, build defenses like sandbags, tank traps, wire, and fences (so important!). Because spotting is very limited, getting spotted is death, so if you're sniping bring the spotter scope and if you're not, hope that sniper is kill greedy and didn't bring it :)

And the inventory is still one of the least fun systems ever made in any game ever. It's *way* better than release (like incomparably so) but it's built on a stupid foundation of bad game design.

I really want to see NMS2 where they add stuff like procedural items to replace elements. For a fictional example, the ""Gurwash"" plant gives ""Gurwash sap"" which is converted in to ""Fuel - Gurwash sap"" which gives slower speed but increases the power of your shields. Then, economies are based on a rating of that trait plus the scarcity of those traits nearby. So Gurwash sap fuel would sell really well on planets where the plant-fuel drains shields, but poorly on planets where the they have a super fuel that boosts everything.

Then, improve exploration. Quests are nice and all, but the organic experience is still pretty shitty. Say you get shot down by pirates. Instead of waking up and just having to fetch your items, you crash on a nearby planet. But the local minerals can't be used to fix your ship, requiring you to find aliens to trade with. Rather than just being one of 3 (well I guess *technically* 4) aliens, it is a custom alien race local to that solar system. But the biome they live in is located further away on the planet in an area where you either need specialized cold resistance or to go through the caves. On your way through the caves you discover Krithondanite, a mineral that is super good for ship armor and unique to this planet.

Meanwhile, I want player interactions to be improved. Rather than giving paltry credits for discoveries, have it reward you with patents. Whenever someone uses a material you named and patented, you get a small amount of credits. So when you discover Krithondanite and name it Supersteel, anyone who uses Supersteel ship armor has to pay you a small fee. Since it is so good, you can make bank just off that discovery. Meanwhile, a galactic market exists where anyone can trade with anyone anywhere for any listed material. NPCs will also start to gradually restock any listed materials so you don't need to mine them continuously, and the more they are bought the faster they restock. The more players buy a given material, the more cities start to develop on that world, and the more warp gates start to be made connected to it.

So suddenly Karith III, the planet with Supersteel, starts to feature massive metropolises with vast mining operations, because players everywhere are buying it. Players start to congregate there through the warpgates (which are now visible on the galactic map once discovered) and sell it for cheaper than the NPCs to snag a hefty profit themselves. Soon, you have a bunch of player bases and an entire economy going, all because you accidentally crashed on a planet and scanned a shiny rock.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * In *payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Which one of these you don't know of? Then there is

1. [Gotham Knights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBh694H67Sc&ab_channel=QuestMode). This is the next Batman game after Arkham series.
2. [Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League](https://youtu.be/uZDGjS5vpIk). This is another amazing game in the same world similar to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy releasing this year.
3. [Hellblade Senua's Saga](https://youtu.be/fukYzbthEVU). If you haven't played Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice (girl with Psychosis), you're missing something. This game gave so much confidence to people with Psychosis. This is next gen graphics with Unreal Engine 5.
4. [Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl](https://youtu.be/SjDMwsbaSd8). Another game with next gen graphics.
5. [Starfield](https://youtu.be/pYqyVpCV-3c). This is Bethesda's game releasing this December and Bethesda is claiming it to be the Skyrim of Space.
6. [Scorn](https://youtu.be/6grwdMemV1o). A much awaited Horror. This game draws it's inspiration from HR Giger's work on the Alien Franchise.
7. [Sifu](https://youtu.be/Kx3R2CNhLWA). A martial arts game in which you age everytime you die. It has already released and has received good reviews.
8. [Arc Raiders](https://youtu.be/xuftkDxjGT4). Again highly anticipated free to play co op third person shooter in space.
9. [Hogwarts Legacy](https://youtu.be/1O6Qstncpnc). Finally an RPG in the Harry Potter world with good graphics.
10. [Lord of the Rings: Gollum](https://youtu.be/HXtU-9hK4Lc).  The next entry in the Middle earth games. Looks quite promising.
11. [A Plague Tale: Requim](https://youtu.be/aPKIQgc0Fnw).

For me the campaign was just taking territory at a good pace, but in stages. You don't want to expand too fast too early. So a reasonable analysis of your economy is how large can the army be if you have to replace 10% of it with two or three turns of income. 

As for taking territory look at all the little bonuses that you will get once you control all two or three cities in a territory. Play to the strengths of that territory. Some are better at making money than units and some even have bousus to specific units.

sp3vte,hwd55y6,t3_sp3vte,"My take from 2021 was as follows:

The terrible (did you honestly expect these games to have any merit given their recent past of woeful releases???):

1. Battlefield - Need I state more.  Excrement in digital format.

2. COD - Sigh. Don't attempt to rewrite history to suit an agenda.  It's almost as if you are passive aggressively telling your buyers that you don't respect or value them.  Also, the campaign is the absolute nadir of all COD games).  

3. Biomutant - Great potential, well meaning.  Ultimately a good buy for the kiddies. 

4. Far Cry 6 - FFS. A copy paste of a copy paste, of a... you get the idea. Offensive, unlikeable characters and cack antagonist. 

The Good - In no particular order:

1. Ratchet and Clank - More of the same but in an inoffensive positive way.  Amazing tech demo of PS5 capability.  More innovation next time please Insomniac.

2. Disco Elysium TDC - I sank 80 hours into this marvelling at the story, the musical score and art style. You will laugh, you will cry.  Simply one of the best.  More please.

3. Ghost of Tsushima TDC - Okay, first off, this got to be a grind at the end with all of the collectibles.  But this was outweighed by stunning visuals, a decent story and the obvious love that the developers put into it.  Additionally I challenge you to play it on hard and not marvel at the gameplay combat mechanics.

4. Guardians of the Galaxy - This one is controversial.  Visually impressive and with a good cast of voice actors. I love the films so it was a no brainer for me.  The story won me over. 

5. Alan Wake - Remastered - I finally got to play this and was not disappointed.  If you like Control you'll enjoy this horror ride.

6. Psychonauts 2 - Innovative and as addictive as nicotine gum.  Weird and idiosyncratic, but unforgettable.  Game of the year contender.

7. Halo Infinite - The Halo I've been waiting for since OG Halo on the very first XBox.  The campaign is SWEET, sci fi art direction incredible and Master Chief is one of my favourite protagonists.  Haven't played multiplayer yet because my PC died.

soooi8,hwd0hda,t3_soooi8,"It's actually not very difficult at all to create custom cartridges for the GBA.

It costs about $70 for the cart flasher that lets you read/write the cartridges. Then you need the a flash board to write the rom to which at most will cost like $15 for the higher storage boards, much cheaper for the lower end boards. Just depends on which rom you want to write. And it includes the full cartridge board and the shell.

Then depending on which cart flasher you have, you usually just connect your blank cartridge and your usb cable to the cart flasher, and then some will have the features built in so its just a matter of opening it on your PC like its a USB drive and dropping the rom on it or you might have to run some software to do it. Then poof. Done. Print out a sticker label for the cart if you want. Buy an empty case. Print out a label for the case.

The hardest part about making them these days is actually finding the blank flash board cartridges.

Growing up, my parents bought me very little outside of Christmas/birthdays, not because they were poor but rather because they were a bit too frugal. 

In turn, as an adult I became almost ""too aware"" of the value of a dollar, so much so that I get paralyzed if I have to spend serious money. I've turned into a hoarder of sorts, never willing to throw anything away. I constantly go for the cheaper option, even though my finances are fine and I can spare the expense. I defer paying for anything unless absolutely necessary. I feel horribly guilty if I spend my money on something frivolous. I get upset over seeing things rise in cost due to inflation. I constantly underestimate how much something is going to cost me because I believe a dollar will buy much more than it actually does. I'm too afraid of losing what money I've saved to invest it into something risky even if that risk might pay out massive dividends.

sp9c94,hwexfkv,t3_sp9c94,"People have already mentioned the games that came to mind for me so I'll try to explain why you could like them and in which ways they resemble those 4

\- **The forest**: Like raft, but way creepier, in a forest, and has a story line kinda similar to raft, however this one is harder to ignore if you don't want to follow it. Beware of the red.

\- **Don't Starve Together**: Like minecraft, and specially terraria, so much so there was a cross-over recently. The difficulty curve is steeper tho, and unlike both of them the characters have different abilities. Like both of them, there's a end boss, so there's some sort of end goal, but you can keep playing afterwards. Stay out of the dark

\-**ARK**: kinda like Valheim if there were dinos, and tech. ARK also has got a story, and a plot twist at it's end (at least at the end of ""the isle"" bc me and my friends are playing them in chronological order and only finished the isle atm). Don't start in Aberration or Genesis if you want to follow the story.

\-**7 Days to Die**: Ever played minecraft with Hostile Worlds - Invasions? No? well it's minecraft but more realistic and with a lot of zombies coming to knock on your door every 7 days. Have fun ~~dying~~  surviving!

\-**Dying Light**: It's a bit of a stretch and i'm probably shoehorning it in bc it's one of my favourite coop experiences out there but like in Raft, you are in a hostile environment. Good Night, Good Luck

\- **Project Zomboid**: While we're in the subject of zombies, do you think 7 Days to Die and Dying Light are too easy? Well if 7 days to die was survival minecraft with more zombies, this is hardcore minecraft with, a commitment to realism and attention to detail to a point that never stops surprising me. Guns are a last resort.

\-**StarBound**: It can be good if you ignore the story but only for so long, and it won't give you the hours of fun all the others can offer. But maybe i'm still mad at the game bc I tried it when my pc was a potato and the terrible design of that game is impossible to ignore when you have a bad pc. ^((just don't))

&#x200B;

I haven't played Green Hell, Grounded or Stardew Valley so i can't say anything about them.

&#x200B;

Honorable mentions:

\-**Rust:** it's PvP heavy, unlike any of the 4 games you showed, kinda interesting if you want a pvp survival experience tho

\-**Deep Rock Galactic**: It lacks the continuous survival elements of those 4 games, no need for food, water, sleep, just bullets and pickaxes, but you still will be surviving for short periods of time until you return to the station, rest a bit, drink some ale, and go right back in. It lends itself to a lot of fun situations of terrible backstabbing or honourable defence of your dwarf brethren

\- Keep an eye out for **Subnautica** multiplayer mod, and ""**Skyrim** Together"" ;)

\- Also i'm not sure if you have already tried all of these ideas but:

Minecraft but with tech mods

Minecraft but with magic mods

Minecraft but modded however you want

Minecraft adventure maps

Minecraft challenge maps (SkyBlock and the like)

Chet's mindset is the kind of thinking that put Valve and Steam where it is today.

Shapeshifting, absolutely out there level design, the sheer terror that was Medoozum due to my childhood fear of bottomless pits, and there I was flying over literally the void

The combat and exploration was amazing as well. Using the thunder bomb attack to shock an entire group of enemies, hoarding Klokies to max out my abilities

Bosses were trippy as well. The Rattlecrab especially

90s platformer with this cool wolverine-esque character. Tons of variance in biomes and enemies. Clever quests. Good handling. 

But what made people think I was making this game up was simple: I SWORE up and down that when I fought the final boss, the hero did this ""hand balloon"" thing where he blew into his closed first while raising his middle finger more with each puff until he flipped off the final boss. Queue epic final fight. 

I found out maybe a couple years ago that there was some insanely small percentage of players who got that hidden Easter egg taunt instead of the regular interaction.

I think logical journey of zoombinis helped me with the critical thinking, pattern recognition and puzzle solving skills my true first video game love required: Zelda a Link to the Past.

When my mom finally got me an SNES after it had been out a couple years, it was the greatest thing to happen to me for gaming. It came with Donkey Kong country 1 and it was just so good. Then I got jet force Gemini and DKC2. 

When N64 came around I believe I played jet force Gemini first. That game blew the lid off just how deep my love for video games became. It was truly huge, epic and rewarding.

Ocarina of Time then of course just totally changed what a Zelda game can be. It led to Twighlight princess and then finally breath of the wild.

&#x200B;

Essentially in Australia we have three tiers of prices (IN MY OPINION - THIS IS BASED OFF OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE PURCHASING GAMES - OVER 250 GAMES AND YES I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA):

&#x200B;

\- Games *normally* belong to either of these three

&#x200B;

Cheap / Standard price for a game (typically $28.95 AUD /  $29.95 AUD + more) (examples being Valheim, Stardew Valley, Raft, Terraria etc.)

\- Ranges from 0 - 35 AUD (0 - 25 USD according to google)

&#x200B;

""Deluxe"" packages or bigger games (typically $49.95 AUD / $44.95 AUD + more) (examples being God of War, Sea of Thieves, Dying Light, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, etc.)

\- Ranges from 40 - 90 (borderline next category) (28 - 64 USD according to google)

&#x200B;

""Ultimate / premium"" packages or the biggest games (typically $89.95 AUD /$114.95 + more)  (Examples being Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Death Stranding, etc)                                        

\- Ranges from 89.95 / 90 - TYPICALLY MAX 120)

&#x200B;

Every statement listed above is FROM MY PERSONAL OPINION and should not be taken as fact. This is based off of my purchasing experience and does not reflect every Australian consumer.

&#x200B;

Please ignore all grammatical errors in this, I should be doing homework instead.

&#x200B;

I am sorry, but for the last time please understand this is MY OPINION if you wish to disagree go for it, but please do not argue with me as this is not a statement of fact, rather a statement of opinion.

The problem stemmed largely due to the fact that console players still think gyro has some sort of a stigma and deemed it a gimmick, no thanks to limited exposure to gyro. What they don‚Äôt understand is gyro emulates closely to mouse control, and serves as an additive feature to finetune analog aiming with fixed speed. Its great for aiming in games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC.

2) Pre-order is a sign of trust in the developer. That trust can obviously be misplaced, but you can't say that because game X failed to live up to expectations, then so would game Y.

  
3) I also disagree that AAA gaming is dead, there are plenty of good AAA games, Playstation's exclusives are an example. Gaming is not only on PC. But there has also been good games on PC, Forza 5, Hitman 3, Psychonauts 2 and I could go on. 

4) Again it is not idiocy to sponsor a game company you like and trust. How come kickstarter funded games get celebrated, but pre-orders are looked down upon? They are basically the same concept. 

5) Whether or not you pre-order doesn't even matter. Crunch will still exist, games will still release broken, because AAA games are vastly harder to make than say a pixel art indie game. It requires way more cooperation and coordination between hundreds of people. And since most people have been locked in their houses for the past year or two, it is not that weird that we are seeing games release in a poor state, given that communication is significantly harder when it is remote, 

6) The big companies have investors for a reason. And they therefor have an interest in getting as much money as possible for the investment to make sense. So it is in the company's own interest to launch a succesful game. 

 Obviously that doesn't make releasing a broken product okay, just sayin' that your pre-order money doesn't mean a lot in the grand scheme of game development.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644493449.0

AAA gaming is not dead, plenty of good AAA games exist. The problem is that this subreddit cares far more about the bad releases and gets into a rage over them while the good releases get forgotten quickly.

Toys is a fitting analogy here because like toys. Games don't always have a direct upgrade path. For Mario kart the obvious next ""upgrade"" would be graphics. This won't likely be feasible until the next console. So what's left? Mechanics? Roster? Story mode? These mainly fall into *preferences* than upgrades.


The reality is that like toys, games have diminishing returns. There's only so much you can do to improve on a product. Legos for example isn't constantly trying to reinvent the lego, they instead put out content they think Lego fans will enjoy. The same thing applies with this dlc. It's just more content for people to enjoy in a game series that has little direct upgrade paths available.

Our eyes are supposed to be used to focusing on things at varied distances throughout the day. Myopia has increased since the smartphone because people now spend a lot more time with the eyes focused on an object only a few feet away, greatly reducing the time spent focusing on objects further away.

It's like exercising a muscle - it needs to focus near, medium and long distances multiple times a day. Just focusing near constantly makes it harder for the eye to focus further away when needed to.

OP having a small screen so close wouldn't be too bad, as they could look around the screen at things behind it, giving their eyes some chance to ""stretch"", but such a huge screen so close means OPs eyes are just going to be focused very close for long periods of time.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644518058.0

The concept itself is good, it exist tons of games out there that really needs to be patched, and fixing it earlier is just better for us gamers.

Developers skips the gametesting phase during development and the games are being sold as unfinished products that is supposed to be fixed between when it goes gold and being shipped. Reviewers are not reviewing the full game, their scores are based on the potential of what the game can be. In Skyrims case, even if the reviewers had had access to the day one patch, it would still be a review about the future potential of the game. Best part is that Bethesda messed up Skyrim even more multiple times with their patches.
And the problem is that people swallows it.
Shall all games get a high score now because they all got the potential of becoming better with patches, or shall they be reviewed based on the current state they are in?

Think of a game like call of duty, when the original modern warfare came out you unlock guns by leveling up and the you get attachments and what not from challenges. It gives players something to chase. But then something interesting happens. A player gets to max level and there is no more stuff to unlock (outside of skins maybe I dont remember) so what do people do? Prestige. Why do that? You lose all the guns you worked towards and start back at level 1 so whats the point? Well you get s special rank icon and oh yeah you can do it like 10 times. Thats the next challenge. At the end of the day though those rank icons are really just a representation of how long you have been playing the game. Anyone could reach max prestige given an unlimited amount of time. It doesnt matter though its a trick that keeps people interested.

Now take halo infinite, a more modern arena style shooter. A complaint I see often is that the progression system is bad. It is not giving that sense of progression to people that they want. You dont get loadouts or gun unlocks so the ‚Äúprogression‚Äù system is basically just a battlepass. Once thats done then what? You just play the game? Ludicrous (joking obviously). I think a lot of players need to feel like they are working toward something which is different from how I see it. I see it as I play a game because its fun and I enjoy it.

I've also started Hades, Kakarot, Earth Defense Force(Best games ever, fight me!), Half Minute Hero, and Legend of Heroes Trails In The Sky.

I've also started Dark Souls, go about 4 bosses in, but it seemed to run quite slowly so, its on the backburner for now. Naruto Ninja Storm, 7 Says To Die and Tomb Raider also gave me trouble, and the Batman Arkham Asylum launcher seems to be broken and wont display the buttons. Otherwise i think thats covered everything.

If you want a more usual Pokemon experience, either Sword/Shield or Brilliant Diamon/Shining Pearl would be good entry points into the series.  Normally, Pokemon games come out in two different versions of the same game.  The only difference being the legendary Pokemon (commonly displayed on the box art of the game) and a few version exclusive Pokemon.  You can trade with other people to get the Pokemon you normally cannot though.  Sword and Shield have a more modern look to the graphics (as far as Pokemon is concerned), whereas Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are remakes of old games and are made to imitate the old art style.  

Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee are meant to be a mix between Pokemon Go and classic Pokemon gameplay.  These games are fun and have a lot of good qualities such as Pokemon appearing in the overworld everywhere, clothing options for both you and your starter (either Pikachu or Eevee depending on the version you buy), and being able to have your Pokemon follow you and even some Pokemon you can ride on if you make them your following Pokemon.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644531695.0

Over a call from Rome, Fleischer spoke to GamesRadar+ at length about the upcoming project and revealed that he‚Äôs already talked to Holland ‚Äì who plays Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie ‚Äì about starring in it.  
  
""Just by coincidence, somebody forwarded me an article where Tom Holland was asked if he could make any video game a movie, which would it be,"" Fleischer says. ""He said Jak and Daxter and so, when I saw him earlier this week on this tour, I said, 'You know, Tom, someone told me that you want to make that movie. I'm actually trying to make it.' So there's the possibility that we could partner again on that one, which I'm really excited about.""  
  
Fleischer also touched on his history with the Jak and Daxter series ‚Äì and the surprising two films that inspire the upcoming project.  
  
""My heyday as a gamer and playing PlayStation was really the first console,"" Fleischer says. ""I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve evolved with all the titles, so I‚Äôm a little bit stuck in the past. \[Jak and Daxter\] was always a game that I just loved.""  
  
""Similar to Uncharted, what makes Jak and Daxter so special is the buddy relationship at the center of it,"" he adds. ""They are a team and they help each other out and they make sacrifices for one another. And that is I think the key to a great comedy. It‚Äôs a little funny to hear, but the two movies that kind of inspired the film adaptation of Jak and Daxter are Midnight Run and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""

1. This is a pixel art of guns from 300 different games (or game related) that I made myself, and I'll be adding more content all the time.
2. This pixel art has no use other than as my personal hobby, and I don't currently have any plans to make it into a game or mod.
3. Please do not ask me any questions about profit-related use, considering the large number of copyright issues.
4. I am a person who knows more about guns, so I can assure you that there is no ""M4 or AK47 for any game"". They all have their own unique features.
5. I didn't use gun's real names just for fun, and the list of answers I haven't finished yet, I'll post them here when I'm done.

Put it like this, you're all working on a project, but Timothy wants to do his own thing. Timothy likes painting pictures of animals, while Sarah, Anthony, Jamal and Siggi are all working on predictive financial forecasts for Q3 that their boss needs by Monday at 2pm. 

Timothy had a job to do toward that, its complicated and extremely important, but he turns up to the zoom call with some quite excellent paintings in the background and everyone gets mad. It's not that they're mad at the paintings per se, everyone can see that Timothy has had lots of fun, but rather they are all upset that they lost their jobs. 

Anthony and Sarah fell out massively, Jamal ended moving back in with his mother, and Siggi got back into using in a big way. Meanwhile Timothy had his zoom settings on mute so he didn't know that everyone was mad it him. And somehow, _somehow_ kept his job.

What I mean is, when playing a team game, you need to actually play as part of the team and contribute, or others around you who are dependent on your actions for the sake of their own success (be it enjoyment or employment) will get mad and feed that back to you. 

Maybe, if you don't want people to get mad at you or give you instructions, you could play a single player game, where your actions don't have consequences that spoil other peoples enjoyment? 

To give you a gaming scenario - if you're playing Halo with 4v4, but one of you just wants to jump on stuff and use a plasma pistol or drive the warthog into stuff, can you see why that might incur the wrath of the other players who actually want to win the match but have to play 3v4 because of you?

I'm trying to explain why people get angry (there's no office manager in this scenario, just like in gaming), because there are no consequences to their actions. In competitive e-sports teams it would be more like the office scenario, granted  

In _this_ scenario Timothy is having a wail of a time, while actually stopping the group from doing the only thing they're there to do, make the presentation on time. 

And online gaming is not the workplace, correct, but the fact I'm having to use a metaphor to explain why gamers get angry at other gamers for not pulling their weight in team games shows the uphill battle I'm fighting.

Playing off-meta in any sense is _deliberately_ choosing a character or weapon that is less efficient and has a lower chance of success (the literal definition of meta in this circumstance) and therefore the person is showing a wilful disregard for their team mates and the overall consequences of their actions. They've actively chosen to handicap their team mates.

My point is that gamers can fall broadly into two large groups; those that are there for the game, and those that are there purely to win. These two factions often don't get on as a result.

I think you're maybe forgetting something... people are inherently not _good_ dude, they're vicious, demanding, selfish and cruel. What stops them from being those things all the time is the consequences created by society, consequences that have been removed by gaming companies through the anonymity of gamertags. 

Its like twitter, if people know who you are and you can be charged with abuse or whatever for what you tweet, people stop tweeting vicious stuff or libel. That's societal consequences in action right there. Say bullshit, get smacked. Gamertags and the anonymity preferred by Xbox, Sony etc do protect the players in some senses, but it also allows people to call me the N word 5 times a day without me finding out who they are and kerb stomping the little cretins.

People are just shit mate. And the gaming companies do NOT care, despite their slight and meagre attempts to police it.

spc398,hwecphv,t3_spc398,"Is there any actual reliable report of consoles being blacklisted due to a purchase from a scalper? I'm not seeing it.

There was some discussion of users getting banned from PS services due to users selling the PS4 collection that is only supposed to be unlockable by PS5 owners. But I don't know how they track that and it may or may not be by serial number.

Sony isn't super into customer service in general so seeing them waste the time to entertain stolen reports from a random scalper doesn't seem like their style. Becoming the ""physical ownership police"" opens a pretty big can of worms for them.

Just make it so if you use them it disables online play, or only pairs you with other people who have them enabled. Just have this stuff built in instead of making people do it themselves. Like CoD Zombies. There comes a point when all you want to do is stupid stuff and play around to HAVE FUN. 

*Begin of rant*

But gaming companies seem to have forgotten that that's what playing games has always been about. Having fun. If you have fun playing purely competitively good for you. I don't. And if you aren't having fun, STOP PLAYING *insert game here* and play something else. Just don't ruin it for everyone else playing just because you don't like it. If you get frustrated, take a break (and yes it IS that simple), instead of taking it out on others. 

Just because your friends play it doesn't mean you have to. You can still have plenty of fun just by being in the party talking to them. If you can't, or they won't let you in the party unless you're playing the same game, find new friends. Or don't, that's up to you. But it's what I would suggest doing.

AND FOR FUCKS SAKE LEARN HOW TO MUTE YOUR DAMN MIC. NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC ASSHOLE. OR YOUR SCREAMING KID/WOMAN/MAN/PARENT/ANIMAL/WHATEVER. Yes I know most games offer a mute function, but IT'S COMMON FUCKING COURTESY. Not that very many people seem to know or understand what that is anymore.

It's like making your textures at insanely high resolutions, then just reducing the quality and saving it a few times.

It doesn't take MORE time to make higher poly models. They are not spending more time modeling each one by hand or something. They make one super high quality version and the lower quality ones are derived from it. There really is no savings to be had by going with lower polygon counts as your starting point.

The real effort comes with the more complicated shit like adding the many layers of details using various types of texture/reflection maps or making systems work Iike body dismemberment or vehicular/terrain destruction. Then you get into specifics like whether or not most of the game is scripted or sandboxy/open world. The former is much easier to build because of the control the game has over the player during scripted events. The developer can do weird shit and just hide it for the sake of getting shit done quickly (ex: the NPC wearing a ""bus"" hat from Fallout), but then the open world sanboxy stuff from that same game can create massive potential for bugs, which can take an inordinate amount of time to fix that doesn't even involve making the game... all that time is just dedicated to making sure the systems devs already made play well with each other.

As a general rule... the more freedom you have as a player, the more bugs there will be to squash, as those freedoms come from more ""systems"" the devs made that interact with one another, and that's what ends up taking a whole hell of a lot of dev time. It's certainly not the poly counts.

It takes much more work for a lot of these higher poly models, textures, and the like.  You could certainly put that effort to more diverse models rather than limited selection of insane super high quality ones, for example. 

That said, there will always be behind the scenes improvements (lighting, sound, even just sheer processing power) that enable more and more advancements without too much dev input that we'll look back on today's games and go ""wow those are dated.""

It's simply a matter of time. Im thinking about lighting and shadow techniques that (in simplifying some) once you drop the plug in, it's just some tweaking. You're not making every single ray tracing calculation as a dev, you're setting parameters and then it handles it from there - and also gives a crazy boost to realism in the process.

You started by saying ""one feature"". The problem is, it's not just one feature. For a crowd to feel realistic, you need each entity (person) to think independently. In order for each person's movement to feel purposeful and independent, we need each person to have a set of motives/objectives for where they're going, where they've came from, and also the fashion in which they navigate to and from these places (do they stop and have a chat along the way, do they simply go directly to their objective, do they stop to look at particular things, do they move out of the way for certain people, etc).

You're no longer just implementing a single feature for realistic crowds, but you're now getting into how do you create a distinct set of motives/objectives for each single NPC in the game so that in the end it truly feels realistic. That in itself could be many features working together.

I kind of roll my eyes when people say ""oh just make realistic crowds please"". There's so much more that has to go into it for it to truly feel realistic.

It is literaly identical from AC2 (AC 1 was pretty clunky) all the way to AC Rogue. It is almost always parry to win and when it's not like that it's press guardbreak to win. It has always been a simple system. Blackflag didn't build on it in any way.

Edward Kenway is very well written and he doesn‚Äôt need magic to work. You can strip the observatory from the story and it still works.

Also i would argue it‚Äôs the best Assassins Creed game, it really shows the conflict between free chaos through the pirates and enslaved order through the Spanish and British without having to do the nefarious mustache twirling baddie trope while also giving you freedom of gameplay by combining forests, cities and ships.

The biggest advantage the Quest probably has over PSVR is that if you have a good enough PC then you can connect your Quest to a PC and just play games on Steam and ignore the Facebook stuff. You'll still need to buy any exclusives like Resident Evil 4 off the Oculus store, but personally all my VR games I own on Steam.

The Quest 2 also can connect to a PC wirelessly, which is a nice feature to have if your play area gets a strong Wi-Fi signal. That said if you can't do this wireless you will need a link cable to connect it to the PC and it does not come with the headset, and it's not exactly cheap either.

As for exclusives it's probably just best to Google exclusives for each system and see what comes up. While they do share a number of titles I will note that PC has my two favourite VR titles which are Half-Life: Alyx(the gold standard in VR story-telling imo) and Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades(A gun sandbox with a number of mini-games to play) neither of which seem to be listed as a PSVR game.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644474677.0

But if you‚Äôre looking for workout, definitely the Quest 2 due to it being wireless (eg more freedom to move around, and no wires means no tangle and thus safer), and having more exercising apps and games like Supernatural and Dance Central (Quest 2 has more non-gaming apps)

In terms of games, both have library that match their strength.  PSVR have various VR titles with better graphics, but limited in gameplay such as no motion control in RE7 or limited content in Gran Turismo or Ace Combat. Quest 2‚Äôs titles tend to make use of its wireless natural for gameplay, and some may even feature Quest 2‚Äô exclusive features, along with exclusives like RE4, Medal of Honor and soon Assassin‚Äôs Creed, GTA and Splinter Cell.

All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner who's passing shall not be mourned. Shall not be mourned.' That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted. So that's funny, too.

I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible happens to you, which it's just about to. Don't believe me? Here, I'll put you on: [Hellooo!] That's you! That's how dumb you sound.

You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a fulltime employee. Where did your life go so wrong?

Your entire life has been a mathematical error. A mathematical error I'm about to correct.

I've only been playing about a week and a half and I have several items at level 20 + the three level 30 items they give you. If I wanted to I could get every item to level 20 with the tickets you get from the ranked, I do have the battle pass though but I only got it for the zeraora skin and not because of the stuff it gives.


  That being said the majority of the items aren't worth leveling past 20. The stats they give at lvl 30 are so minimal it's not even funny.

Apparently the numbers have shown companies that they make more by charging for the campaign and season passes...all I can say is at least I don't feel like someone bought competitive progress I wasn't willing to pay for.

In single player games, I feel like selling cheat codes is w/e..(if you want them, and they're selling them, fine I guess that's your choice and nobody forces you to  buy em and nobody is really adversely affected.)

In multiplayer games, it feels WAY worse, because the one who pays gets the leg up and the one who either doesn't want to pay for an advantage because they're looking for a level playing field or just CAN'T afford to pay for said advantage is just screwed and playing a game that will never be fair (and to me, thus will never be as fun).

In MMO's like Lost Ark...assuming there's any multiplayer content, you're just taking a shortcut to endgame.  In WoW (my most comparable experience) if I could pay to get xp/gold boosts that'd mean I'd be getting end-game gear faster and a leg up in pvp modes and/or Arena (especially when Arena was first created, which is akin to any newly released game).  So, it NEVER feels good unless you're buying your way through...and IDK about anyone else, but it doesn't make ME feel good to parade around my gear that I've essentially purchased with real money instead of attained through skill and/or time in game.

Spoilers below:

The thing I took away from the game was about how much violence begets violence. Joel getting killed early on pissed off a ton of people, rightfully so, but it made me, as a player vengeful on going after who was responsible. But the game shifts and we follow this other slew of people. Okay. I‚Äôm willing to see where it‚Äôs going. But when the game returns to Ellie, who on her vengeance quest kills the people I began to identify with, I became conflicted. And soon enough through my gameplay I was opting to sneak past enemies vs actually killing them. Considering this was a video game in which 0 consequences I make in the game will have any impact of my real life, the fact it made me feel this way I think was truly outstanding.

But that‚Äôs just my opinion. I know people hate this game to death like it‚Äôs a fucking Olympic sport to see who hates it more. But I loved it. And I will probably never play it again in my life Because of the violence depicted in the game just utterly makes me feel horrible.

No towns?  The function of a town is to have npcs for shops and side quests.  That's it.  Both of those are already covered with the save points also acting as shops and the cei'th stones acting as side quest.

The game plays itself?  Only when you play against easy enemies.  Just like in every final fantasy if the fight is easy enough you could always just mash x to attack everything and be fine.  Here its the same thing.  The real gameplay is before the fight begins when you set up your paradigms and gear and how you grow your characters in the crystarium.

I've started playing it in 2015 (release date, when Beta ended), I rarely took a break, and I'm still playing it almost every day. In my opinion, the main selling points are the following ones.

1. Replayability: While there are some mechanically-intensive Heroes that you can't simply pick and do well with, there is a good amount of Heroes you can play without major time investment to be good enough at them. In addition to that, you'll get to play on 14 different Battlegrounds!

2. Fast-paced Action: You don't have to farm Experience for 5 minutes straight. Every few minutes, an Objective will spawn and often force the teams to fight each other, although they never really stop. Thanks to most Battlegrounds being relatively small, the games offers a lot of strategic options as soon as the game starts. Having a Mount allows for quick rotations and ganks.

3. Strategy: There is place for everyone, from micro players to macro players. After learning the various Battlegrounds, you'll be able to get value outside of team fights too. A well-timed Camp can make a difference between a won and lost Objective. Just choose Heroes who fit more your playstyle, mechanical skill, and game knowledge.

A roguelike should always make it so when the player fails, it is their fault. Noita does not do that. I have been 90 minutes into a run and nuked out of existence from a random enemy picking up a nuke wand off screen. Noita's runs can be hours and hours long, and entering a new area can encounter new and strange enemies that literally end you in the blink of an eye, saying you need to spend 90 minutes getting there just to be nuked out of existence in 2 seconds again is saying you do not respect player's time.

I get it, I understand the play style they want their game to be, and they should keep that as a game mode, but look at their achievements. only 10% of players have actually beaten the end boss. The vast majority of players do not get to experience the vast majority of the game they paid for, I find that morally wrong.

I have spent like 60 minutes plus to get to a new area and INSTANTLY killed by a new enemy I didn't understand. For a game to say I have to spend an hour to get there again just to die maybe less quickly... like I said, doesn't respect my time when a quicksave function for us non hardcore players could get me back here in an instant. I get it, they have an ultrahard game imagined with lore hidden behind those ultrahard gameplay styles, but most of the people buying their game are not expecting that as it is not expressed in their press material, and a dismally small number of their players actually get to experience a meaningful amount of the game due to their restrictive permadeath game style.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644470521.0

Hyper Potions healing for 200 HP made Max Potions pretty much pointless outside of Late-Postgame shenanigans. By the time you can even GET Max Potions at all, most Mons won't even have 200 HP to begin with, or just so little more that it's completely neglible like say, having 208 HP or something. And even those that actually do go significantly beyond that (which are basically just Legendaries and Mons that have HP as their de facto Mainstat like Wigglytuff or Snorlax) will probably only hover around 250 or so, so Hyper Potions were generally still sufficient enough while still being much cheaper. By making them worse, it gives Players an actual reason to buy Max Potions when they first become available.

For the same reason, Super Potions also used to become completely useless once you get to a Vending Machine. Before it was changed, *all three* Vending Machine Drinks used to heal just as much / outright more than Super Potions while also being cheaper at the same time, making them better in every way. Nowadays this is only the case for Lemonade, and even then they nerfed those from 80 HP to 70 HP aswell, so now they only heal 10 more to make it not as blatant (and so that Vendor Machines still have some use *outside of* being cheaper)

And lastely, Legends Arceus simply made everything have higher HP in the first place, so they had no choice but to make Healing Items stronger to compensate.

> When Pok√©mon are dormant inside a small item like a Pok√© Ball, they can demonstrate the ability to convert themselves and their container into electrical signals.

> However, it is unknown whether this ability is used consciously or not by the Pok√©mon.

> In the early experiments, even when the Pok√© Ball was successfully transferred, the Pok√©mon inside would repeatedly go missing.

> Due to the knowledge that fax transmissions over phone lines or ordinary PC transmissions are not of a high enough quality to avoid accidents, it is now illegal to transfer Pok√©mon via those connections.

It was easy to use and simple to understand; I don't think too many people would be confused by it.

If you want to reward players for a fast time, you first have to decide how to determine what's fast for each puzzle. If you base it on rank relative to other players, then the first x players to solve the puzzle each day will get the reward just for having solved it.  The deeper you dive, the murkier it gets.

Perhaps keeping it simple would work.  You could just display a simple message for players that achieve something, e.g. ""Congratulations! You're the first person to complete today's puzzles!"" or ""Congratulations! You beat today's average time!""

sp313y,hwed4ve,t1_hwdn1h6,"to make it short: i was probably annoyed by the cost of every game being so high and having to pay for online services wich i didnt really need. A decent pc just made way more sense in terms of upgradability, flexibility and eapecially cost once the entry hurdle was out of the way

Here s the long story:

i started on a pc and went through a lot of consoles in my childhood (ps2,ps3,wii,ps4) at the beginning of the ps4 era there werent many games wich i was interested in, i started watchin more tech reviewers and got more tech savy in general. Noticed that paying for psplus didnt work out for me so i completely sold the system.

was gaming on a really weak laptop (1900hrs of garrys mod mostly lmao) before i build my own pc wich i gave to my brother.not too long after. After that i bought another used pc and thats what im runnin rn.

 i dont have a high end pc or anything
in fact i exactly have the ""average gamer pc"" wich the linus tech tips channel made a whole video about. 
bought it used for like 500‚Ç¨ on something similar to fb marketplace.
but it works perfectly for me and my gaming needs.

games can be found dirt cheap, started with dirt cheap hardware like a mouse and keyboard combo for 50‚Ç¨ 
now im on a membrane keyboard i picked up used and some random mouse for 70‚Ç¨. just recently got the microsoft mx vertical cuz i liked how it felt in my hand (not using it for shooters though)


i guess the game variation wasnt big enough for me and every game felt like a huge investment. i was just annoyed of only getting so much for all my saved up allowance back then.
meanwhile on the pc side you just needed to buy a decent setup once and are good for many years whilst the games can be dirt cheap to find, online is free, communities exist for the smallest of games wich usually take forever to arrive on consoles and the flexibility.

i only really played racing games since shooters were no fun for me with a controller and the ps4 at the beginning of its life didnt really have much to offer for me as a kid back then.

why a switch? 
mostly cuz anything thats on ps or xbox is either available on pc or didnt interest me really. i literally only own a ps4pro because of ghost of tsushima

i already owned a hackable switch once but sold it cuz i barely used it. having all games at your disposal kinda destroys their value of them for me so all it did was sit around. end of story i sold it.

then i saw animal crossing and was really interested (i had already played it a little when i owned the hacked switch and got interested again), looked for the cheapest deal available and bought a bundle of console+animal crossing new for basically used price.


thanks for reading! i think if i had to break it down how i got to where i am now, i guess i would say: cost
i was simply spending my time looking and comparing for the best deals possible. and the pc just made the most sense back then.



(titles on pc i played the most: garrys mod(when i was on a cheapo laptop); csgo, rainbow six siege, f1 2019, forza horizon 4)

only titles i own for switch are animal crossing, tetris 99 and metroid dread.

Got the advance a few years later, parents would buy me games if I did well in school, continued playing pokemon, got the SP and I saved super hard for the DS and Nintendogs bundle (which was like ¬£99 for both)

I guess it's just what I had at the time though, I began playing league of legends in 2009 and still played on the ds and wii. 

Steam made it easier to buy PC games and I grew my library through sales  prices if consoles skyrocketed along with inflation so now I don't buy many switch or AAA PC games.

Maybe all that is required to keep a free to play game functional, maybe it's just greed, but from what I've heard the game has better and more frequent endgame content patches than the top paid MMOs, with a satisfied free to play playerbase, so it's fine by me.

Warframe is doing the same model, you either work for stuff or you just buy it with cash and it's barely getting any new content, it has no endgame, etc. Compared to that Lost Ark is a clear winner.

I get your point, non-cosmetic microtransactions are bad, but maybe they wouldn't even be able to make the game work without milking lazy rich people who don't have enough time to play.

I never modded Mass Effect... but I also didn't play any of them more than once.  That's an important detail.  There are three games.  Are you going to play them all twice, at the very least?  It is a legitimate question if you assign value to playing a clean game, and if you also assign value to mods in how they can improve the experience.  If you want to do both... you'll have to play each game twice.  Once clean, and once modded.

Sometimes... you know a mod will make things better.  There are FO3, FONV, and FO4 mods to repair tons of broken things in the games.  So... that's a kind of mod that probably could be added to a game the first time through, just to avoid the broken things.  But a mod that changes the foliage and skies, and adds weather patterns?  They look absolutely beautiful in FO4, but completely take away from the bleak and washed aspects of the original post-apocalyptic world.  There's a reason why the Capital Wasteland looks like it does... and the Oasis quest would lose much of its meaning if the ""wasteland"" was as green and lush as what we are shown in that quest.  This is not to say one shouldn't load up with environmental mods that make the game look amazing.... just that one should at least see how it was supposed to look first.

System Shock 2 was like that.  Great game, horrible character/opponent models.  An independent gamer made a mod... more than just a texture repack, replacing the models themselves and making better looking enemies/creatures.  Far better looking.  The game wasn't really meant to be modded though, so for a while most people didn't even know about the graphical improvements.  Now, a version of that model pack is included with the Steam copy of the game if you pay extra... or you can still download a copy off the net for free to ""fix"" the game.  Again... this is a mod that I would agree should be applied before playing the game at all.  The horrible models didn't add to the atmosphere.

It is up to you in the end.  There's no shame in loading up with the fixes and improvements you've been dying to see in that game.  You don't have to be some kind of purist and play the game clean the first time, no matter what.  You can even do it bit by bit... add mods that repair broken parts of the game... then after you've played a while, add mods that... alter NPC behavior, add weapons/outfits, quests, etc.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644473188.0

I found this old weird C64 system, I managed to buy this old disk reader that works via USB and plugged it into my computer. Now it's displaying an evil laughing Mario every time I start my computer, his eyes are bleeding. 

Day 2

My monitor had a pool of blood under it. My phone rang six times in the middle of the night. 

Day 3

OMG I found out where the blood comes from, I put a surveillance camera on my computer, at 3:33 AM it turned on and Mario was there and his eyes were real and they bleed and they bleed and they bleed

Day 4

The phone won't stop ringing, when I answer, all I hear is static and what sounds like screams. My computer won't shut off and I can't open my front door or any windows in my apartment. I hear his laughter all the time.

There are 3 games in the series and I'd recommend starting at the beginning because Origins is truly the masterpiece of the series. The second one is sort of the redheaded stepchild of the bunch but it's still a worthy successor. Inquisition, lastly, is definitely the flashiest one and the actual gameplay is a vast improvement from 1 and 2's combat system.

If you're already on a 4k monitor, run at 100% scaling. If your framerate isn't high enough, lower the scaler. If you still have enough GPU power, than it wouldn't hurt to increase it instead.

2. Stadia is actually quite interesting in that Google take a cut of game sales outside of the subscription; this means if the platform were ever to pick up steam (improbable at this point, but that's irrelevant), it could function on a business model a lot more like Steam's or the Play Store's (yes, the server costs are much bigger, but they inevitably make more money off the data they gather, so the comparison holds IMHO). This means they are less likely to increase the price of the subscription compared to Netflix, who do not have any other revenue source. And again, the subscription is optional.
3. Since there is 0 barrier to entry (you can basically just launch the website on anything with a screen and an internet connection), exclusivity is not an issue as long as platforms do not have mandatory subscriptions. So the fight for exclusives is less problematic for platforms like Stadia than it is for existing consoles, which require the purchase of expensive hardware.

&#x200B;

And finally, **I agree that what you are describing is a potential scenario, and should be fought against**!

The problem is that you are basically describing xCloud (Cloud Gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) and calling it Stadia. And yes, people are gravitating towards xCloud over Stadia because they believe a subscription-only model is better without noticing that it is likely to be more expensive and restrictive in the long run.

And guess what, those 2 people were the more ""core"" gamers that have great PCs with 90+Hz monitors and tons of heavily reflex-based game experience (fighting games and FPS).

&#x200B;

So while theoretically I agree that this is a down-side of cloud gaming, I feel pretty confident in saying that the only people who will actually care are competitive and semi-competitive players. The very same players that are more likely to gravitate towards getting a gaming computer than a console. If you set aside the current hardware shortages, I expect a LOT of console players will eventually transition over to cloud gaming; and that's a lot, even before we add in the mobile gamers that now get access to AAA titles ""on the go"", and also the PC players that don't play games where an extra 10‚Äì20% click-to-photon latency is an issue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for ownership... well CDs, cassettes and vinyls are still a thing, but that hasn't stopped a ***huge*** majority of people from transitioning to streaming. It's unrealistic to expect games to follow a different course; and while I will always support DRM-free platforms like GOG, it doesn't mean they can't co-exist alongside other means of playing games.

sp1c0y,hwd2iyt,t1_hwcwm02,"This is quite unrealistic though. Here's what I actually pay to use Stadia:

* 14‚Ç¨/month for my fiber connection (no data caps because I live in a country that doesn't allow monopolistic practices); also, I need decent internet for work, so I cannot decently count this towards my ""gaming"" budget.
* I buy games on sale a majority of the time, and except for Cyberpunk (which came with a free controller and Chromecast), I have yet to pay more than 20‚Ç¨ for a game.
* I currently subscribe to Stadia Pro for 10‚Ç¨/month, though I could drop it at any time and keep playing the games I've purchased.

That's around 140 games in my library (And I've played at least half I'd say) for a total of about 340‚Ç¨ (again, not counting internet access, I would still pay for it regardless).

The main issue here is the price of internet access in countries like the USA, and its availability in remote areas. Availability is increasing FAST, and prices in the USA will change when people vote for people who actually mean them good (as opposed to people who defend large corporations above all in this case).

So as far as I can tell, cloud gaming will eventually be cheaper than buying hardware for most people; and it already is for a significant portion of gamers.

Stadia is like paying to go to a gym instead of buying the hardware yourself.

Actually that's not quite right since you can buy games and the subscription is optional. So it would be more like a gym that offers 2 packages:

1. You can pay a subscription and they let you use a wide collection of exercise machines whenever you want.
2. You pay once to be able to use a single type of exercise machine whenever you want for as long as the gym remains open. You don't have to pay ever again, and they guarantee there is always at least one of these machines available for you to use.

Plus, following the analogy, you can combine both since some machines are only available through Option 2.

The comparison also holds since instead of taking up space and spending a lot to buy the machines yourself, you can just use a local bus (my analogy for the internet XD) and go the the gym at any time to use the machine at a lower cost.
