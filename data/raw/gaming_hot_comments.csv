Escape from Tarkov- Even though the game is difficult, in beta, time consuming and frustrating, it is one of the most rewarding and satisfying games ive played.

t72bft,hzhmz68,t3_t72bft,"In Gen 8, the only starter that really changed its physicality was Sobble and even that wasn't by much, it just got taller and lankier. Grookey stayed a monkey walking on all 4s, Rillaboom still walks on its knuckles. Scorbunny didn't change its body type at all, stayed a bipedal rabbit soccer player for the entire evolution line.

In Gen 7, Litten is obviously the poster child for this, but Rowlet and Popplio didn't change. Rowlet stayed a bird and Popplio stayed a seal/clown/ballerina thing.

Gen 6 was probably the worst for this. Chespin's evolution line was bipedal from the start though it was kinda all over the place during the evolution.  Fennekin turned in to a fire...witch... thing... and Froakie turned in to a ninja.

Gen 5 was kinda weird for this. Tepig definitely followed the trend. But Snivy and Oshawott went in reverse. Both of them start bipedal and change in their final evolution. Snivy loses its arms and legs all together (I refuse to call this little flaps on Serperior's back ""arms"") and Oshawott turns in to a quadruped. (Which I was actually disappointed with because I really liked Dewott's design and wish they pushed that design a bit further instead of taking a hard right.)

Gen 4 all the pokemon stayed basically the same as they evolved. Turtwig became a bigger turtle. Chimchar became a bigger monkey. Piplup became a bigger penguin. No body style changes really.

Gen 3 was pretty bad. Torchic goes from a bird with no arms and barely any wings, in to a bird with weirdly it kinda seems like 4 legs that stands upright (Blaziken's ""arms"" are actually bird feet if you look at it) so it's got 4 legs but technically only uses 2 for walking so still bipedal i guess. Treecko stays mainly the same. Mudkip turns into a biped but recent games tend to have Swampert's model hunched over on all 4s.

Gen 2 none of the starters really changed. Cyndaquil stayed a fire ferret thing. Chikorita stayed a grass penis monster. Totodile stayed a bipedal alligator.

Gen 1 everyone stayed the same except Charmander who grew wings. Bulbasaur went from small frog/dinosaur with plant on back to big frog with plant on back. Squirtle from small turtle to big turtle. Charmander from small burny lizard to big burny lizard with wings.

It's honestly not as prevalent as people make it out to be. 6/24 starters change from some type of quadruped in to a biped as they evolve. 2/24 actually change from bipeds in to quadrupeds or... nulliped (not sure if thats a real word. animal with no legs)",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646510531.0

Also, I recommend the Xbox Game Pass. Has plenty of the games I suggested on it, you can frequently grab it on sale for 1 dollar for the first month, and lets you try a bunch of things for way cheaper.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646513064.0

That being said, ER does have it’s share of absolutely bullshit enemies and ‘boss’ fights, although so far they seem to mostly be relegated to the optional dungeons and catacombs. For example after an absolutely abysmal dungeon that seems like it was designed by someone who only knew about the “thank you dark souls” meme the final boss is just two buffed up crucible knights that you have to fight at the same time. They hit like a truck and are basically immune to being staggered, and one of them has a greatshield that deflects your attacks and sets you up for near instant death of you attack into it.

I was born in a brazilian family with not many resources. We had a PC since I was 2 years old because my father used it to work. He'd let me play on spare time. Almost every saturday he'd bring me one of those gaming magazines (some of them were but posters with a CD attached). But since it was still the mid 90's to early 2000's I could run basically anything and every now and then my father would seek an upgrade to the rig (or a new rig, even) so he could keep working and I could keep playing. He used to be a Gamer himself till I was about 7.

At age 14, coincidentally in my birthday, they bought a new PC those were the times when 4Gb of RAM were the bomb at least in my country. I worked, at the time, as an apprentice designer of sorts, and with my first pay I bought a 9500GT... That PC lasted for 10 years, again with my father fixing any problem we ran into but with no upgrades due to budget, till I got a more or less steady job and bought the one I have now, which I have been upgrading every now and then with my father's guidance whenever I have doubts about hardware.

Fell in love playing Sonic adventure and this was PS2 when SOCOM II was the hot game.

My mom was very cool with me playing mature games, remember being bought 50 cent: bulletproof and Def Jam FFNY. 

I don’t have kids but I am still close with the older cousin and he’s now in his 50’s with young kids I now play older cousin too.

These kids aren’t even hitting puberty they’re running linux based programs and their own servers. I have a 14 year old helping me build my computer and I’m using him as a secret weapon at Best Buy, which is even furthering his confidence in his knowledge of technology. I try to play with them but it usually ends up with them teaching me how to play, stealing my kills in order to “protect me”, and then going off to play with their friends while I play Jurassic Park or something.

Games like Bushido (1983), Sopwith (1985), the original MS Flight Sim, etc. I remember playing all the Sierra games - Space Quest, Hero's Quest, etc. Prior to that I can recall using a Coco computer with the audio tape drive and stuff like that.

When I was 12, my parents bought me my very own computer for Christmas. It was a Packard Bell Force 1 286 w/1MB of RAM and a 40 MB hard drive (I upgraded to 2 later so I could play Hero's Quest II). Built my first computer, a 386 SX 33 when I was 16 or so, and the rest was history. At one point in my life I could barely afford living on my own - no TV service, barely making rent and food and car insurance and other bills, so gaming became a primary source of entertainment.

I was still active outside with friends and stuff, but I split time between gaming other activities. I think my dad in particular supported my gaming/computer habits because I think he saw computers were going to be the future. He was right because I got into IT (and left, and came back but that's another story).

So I adopted the same philosophy with my son - I taught him basics of computers, we built him a rig, picked out parts, etc. Taught him about sockets and memory timing and all that good stuff.

This game is obligated to be played on 2 players, two person are trying to escape prison and stay hidden while they are try to revenge of whom put them there.
My sister only plays the sims and among us, during her vacation we played this one and have fun.

2 - Knowledge is power.
Is a fun game of question and answer that can be played in 4 persons and use an app on your phone as a controller, is super fun to play with friends and laugh.

3 - That's You.
Is a party game where you again use an app as a controller and you make selfies, make draws on those pictures and answer personal fun questions. Is another game to play with friends and relax.

4 - Horizon Chase Turbo.
Is a racing game based on Top Gear, reminds of the 16 bit era with the races being short and arcade mode, having different modes and championships.
There's a mode called rookie series so you can learn the basic there and them go to other modes.
You two can play on worl tour and open the countries together, participate the championship too.
The game is simple and complex at the same time.
I play those last 3 with a group of friend, where 2 have video game but  they are casual gamers, not hardcore like me and probably the entire group and 1 just play with us but we have a night of fun when we did this.

Don't remember about what, maybe some TV show they were watching. I sat there and went ""yeah, that sounds cool."" I showed some base level interest in something they cared about, just because. Just gave them a basic, pleasant human interaction for a minute of their day.

If you compare a very cross-platform multiplayer experience like Apex or COD, you are going to get a lot more open mic garbage that you don't want to hear. But if you go and play a dedicated PC game like Valorant or CS:GO, all players will be using push to talk and you will hear way less background static bullshit.

The fact is that these multiplayer games need to start implementing better features to prevent this sort of stuff. Specifically, noise suppression that Discord has. Before the noise suppression feature came out, I could not stand playing with people who refuse to use push to talk and force me to listen to every single one of their key clicks. It's ridiculous.

It would also be nice if developers would start including a push to deafen keybind to shut up any backseat gamers that feel they need to talk over your attempt to clutch.

t6vha1,hze6g5g,t3_t6vha1,"Contemporary answer: *Deep Rock Galactic* has a ton of mechanics which serve no purpose beyond making the game more fun. These include:

- A between-missions lobby with beer, a jukebox, and barrels to kick

- Over a dozen special beers with silly effects like setting you on fire or teleporting you into space. The ingredients are found on missions, adding extra peril for literally no benefit.

- The ability to pat tame enemies on the head and tell them they're a good boi

- A dedicated button just to shout ""ROCK AND STONE!"", which arguably glues the entire game together

The most useless (and arguably most qualifying here), however, is Doretta, which needs explanation.

One of the mission types has you escorting a robotic drill tank that makes sad noises when she takes damage. Much like the mineral-carrying M.U.L.E. robot (a.k.a. Molly), the dwarves of DRG affectionately named this tank Doretta.

At the end of the mission, Doretta's head pops off and can be carried. This is also the part of the mission where you have three minutes to run back to the evac pod while under attack by constantly spawning enemies, and if you all die, its game over. You have the option of taking Doretta with you.

Carrying Doretta's head slows you down and prevents you from using weapons, which on higher difficulties can make it very challenging. If dropped or tossed incorrectly, she might fall into a pit or ravine, making things even harder.

There is no reward for returning Doretta safely except for getting to see her on the mission victory screen, and no penalty for failure beyond a feeling of guilt.

This feature was only added at the request of players because leaving Doretta behind made them sad.

The problem is, this type of contrast typically comes from the basis of humans not developing any sort of critical or analytical thought in these sorts of situations.

The notion that humans wouldn't be able to grasp the artificiality of phenomenon and seek to understand, control and replicate it is one which goes against what we know of our species. Even with the Cargo Cults, they actively sought to recreate facsimiles of planes in an attempt to initially summon, and then replicate, the very 'gods' they believed in.

The basis of religion is faith, you are believing in something without knowing something. Religion is a medium to give sense to things we cannot explain or understand. I am not religious by the way, just putting it out there since you seem like the type who jumps to conclusions

With that said, the way people embrace technology these days is very similar. People grasp and cherish technology without fully understanding it. We happily smash colorful blocks on our phones without realizing that someone somewhere is collecting information about us, we blindly love product brands and defend them without knowing who's behind the corporate name, what do these people want and what are they actually doing (is it not the same as giving sacrifices to gods), we consume and demand more technology because we use it as a tool to escape our problems -- instead of fixing our problems (is it not the same as asking God for a miracle cure instead of taking steps to look at the source of the disease). 

Many years ago people would bring disease into a village or poison the water and then demand sacrifices to some serpent god as if it would fix the problems they themselves created. Is it not any different now? Haven't the oil companies purposefully forced people to use more fuel and making cars less fuel efficient in order to make more money then create an environmental problem only to bring us electric cars as a solution? Do tech companies purposefully release underdeveloped products only to sell us marginal upgrades a year later, creating an unsustainable demand for exotics metals and components?

X does Y because 'Magic'. 

But that has only ever been the starting point of human inquiry. Human are immensely inquisitive, clever and intelligent animals, far more than most media portrays us as. If you give a human a tool specifically designed to be used by people, they can usually figure out how to use it on their own. And that use drives exploration and the desire to understand deeper workings.

It's the same issue as ""Humans fear the unknown"". It's only true in the most rudimentary way, and instantly starts to fall apart under scrutiny.

I replayed the original and it’s soo much better than the remake. 

Plus the remake comes off as a cash grab. As of now, based on the % of the game released in the first one, it’ll cost $540 plus tax to finish the story. While yes it is costing them lots of money to make it, $540 for a story of a game.

Edit: though the combat itself wasn’t bad. But hard mode the only healing is from boxes. No items or materia in or out of combat, no benches. It just tedious to brake boxes, save, reload, brake boxes, repeat.  Poor design. Plus adding red xiii but not making him playable like he originally was, but adding cait sith to a cutscene he was never in originally. Granted they’ll need to make cait sith eventually and maybe red xiii will be playable, but if they’d made him playable at the end of the first, they could just import that data for the second and have that work done. Some fights weren’t designed well( arena, specifically the house. Every time the stagger gauge filled, I’d get a stupid mid battle cutscene, killing the flow of gameplay, and making me lose the mechanic that you are really supposed to use on bosses.

You take the role of Artemy Burakh, a city trained surgeon with roots from a tribe of indigenous people to the region known as the Menkhu. Cultural clash ensues between the more modern culture of the town and the traditional culture of the Menkhu people as the pandemic ensues. The town is filled with strange mysticism, superstitions and cultural rules/taboos Artemy relearns as he returns to his home town. The Sand Pest is deadly and acts as though it has sentience, you only have 12 days to stop the outbreak. There are no monsters or zombies or demons (though there are some odd humanoid steppe creatures which are explained in the story I won't spoil). What makes Pathologic unique is the Sand Pest is just a disease and the victims of it do not become monsters. Rather they become desperate people who simply require help which cannot be given due to the dieseaes deadlines. 

There's also Pathologic Classic HD as well but it's mega 2011 unplayable slav jank so I just suggest playing the spiritual successor Pathologic 2 instead.

FromSoftware’s games are all about trial and error. Learning from your mistakes. If they’re too hard for you, you’re either unwilling or unable to pay attention and learn, or you’re just too dull to understand that you’re not going to succeed at everything the first time",28,1,0,False,False,False,1646347318.0
t62baz,hz9z2h7,t3_t62baz,"I think people have a misunderstanding of the concept of ""difficulty"". For the vast majority of games that general consensus says are ""difficult"" - it's not about skill, it's not about grinding, or *forcing* your way through, or even playing for a huge amount of time. After all, you're just pressing buttons - the exact same as you've done on any other game. **It's about changing how you play**. This is what I think people mistakenly call ""difficult"" - being forced to change how they play to progress - and gamers really don't seem to like it when they have to change.

A simple example of how stubborn gamers are: In Skyrim they will run up a unclimbable mountain rather than go around it, taking 3x as long.

People don't want to change how they play games and this is the core of what many of them think ""difficulty"" is. Especially when it comes to games like Dark Souls.

Another example - the Marauder in Doom Eternal. My god how people complained about it and how difficult it was as an enemy. But in reality, it was not difficult, it was simply different to all other enemies in that game and required the player to change their strategy. Once they changed their strategy, the Marauder is very easy. But people complained en mass.

***My broad point is - the vast majority of complaints about difficulty are not about difficulty - they're about a game that wants a player to have a variety of playstyles, change between them as required, and be aware of those changes in game. None of that requires excessive time, or skill at all. It simply requires a open and fluid mindset.***

_______________

Concessions: there are genuinely difficult things in games, and these are largely fall into 2 camps:

1. Extremely sensitive timing (e.g. 1/30th of a second button pressing precision, or requiring you to complete X task in X seconds with very little margin for error). This is EXTREMELY rare and almost never encountered by the vast vast majority of gamers in their entire gaming lives (with the exception of music and rhythm games). Some common games have timing intervals - sure, but they are well within the average persons reaction time, and even seniors have reaction times good enough to play most games (e.g. a parry to a telegraphed move in Dark Souls does not require anything other than the bare minimum of human reaction times - it does not exclude anyone except those with very serious neurological diseases)
2. Physical dexterity. Only applies to certain games like rhythm and music games that either require special controllers (guitar hero or whatever) or unusual button combos that require physical finger dexterity outside of the normal range you would use in games.


__________


Basically my opinion is - difficulty options aren't really about difficulty, they simply allow gamers to brute force their way through a game. They allow a person to play a game without changing.

People complaining about Elden Ring not having an easy mode, or not having quest markers, or not being accessible enough, and all that other hand holding stuff are the reason that so many games are the same boring uninventive rehashes.

In an era of gaming where most games make you feel like a toddler being led around on a leash by overbearing parents, it is so refreshing to have a game that drives you out the forest, beats the piss out of you, and then leaves you to the wolves.

Does it suck that not everyone will be able to overcome the challenges that the game presents and might not enjoy it?  Yes.
But does that mean Hidetaka Miyazaki should change his vision of the game? No.

Because it takes away from his vision and just pushes the game towards the same boring shit that most people don't even remember beating even year later.

These games are not flawless, but they are perfect for what they need to be, and I admire Hidetaka Miyazaki's conviction to not compromise his own design philosophies so that people experience the game the way he wanted it to be experienced.

I'm not a fan of souls borne games usually as the ability to play them the way you want isn't really there yet. But Elden Ring gives you that option. If you find the bosses too hard, then you don't have to give up because the boss is blocking your path to progress, you can just go find a smithing stone tunnel, some glovewart, or a nice area to farm out runes and get way more powerful to be able to easily beat the boss you were struggling with.
I've never beaten a souls borne game until Elden Ring for that very fact. Sure some of the bosses don't care how hard you hit, or how many times they need to beat you down to kill you, but you can stack the odds in your favor to make those hard bosses quite simple if that's the way you prefer your games.

The way I see Elden Ring is you control the difficulty by the way you choose to play the game, you can go from boss to boss with some exploration in-between or you can grind out some upgrades and levels or you can go in naked with a katana and get that no hit kill if that's how you choose to play.

The visuals are breathtaking, the story is surprisingly deep, the secrets are plentiful, the gameplay is smooth and feels rewarding, the world is huge and full of life, the sound is incredible.

t7dpew,hzgyrdr,t3_t7dpew,"Sure, so let’s try this: 

If the main character has slime aspects, definitely lean into the visualization of that for the core mechanics as tying the visuals to combat is always very rewarding.

Off the top of my head, I’d make an “elastic” attack, meaning like a rubber band (keeping consistent with the “slime” visuals), the player has the option to charge the character backwards for X amount of frames.

This is your key risk/reward loop in combat, as this should/must not be invulnerable frames, but the longer charge would not only do more damage, but extend the slimes reach. 

You could actually go crazy with it, building maps and gameplay around slightly hard to reach enemies your character has to fling themselves to (see: Zac from league of legends for reference). You can also make your own decision as a designer whether the player should stay rooted to the ground during this attack, or if they should fling, with the latter being more chaotic but also add a very interesting mobility aspect to combat. 

Additionally, while this is less core combat and more gameplay loop, the player could have a “gelatinous cube” aspect in which they could melt over/absorb their dead enemies, which of course in this case would allow them to pick up and use the defeated enemies weapons and abilities while absorbed, a la Kirby. Could be fresh and fun atop yhe mobility aspects, and certainly something I’d play.

Good luck, and have fun in making your game!",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646500126.0

When the devs refused to tone down the violence, Nintendo pulled their publishing agreement. It languished in dev hell for a few years while they tried to find a new publisher, which leads us to fact 2…

While they tried to find a new publisher, the devs started work on a new video game about driving around a city and doing crimes and running from the police. They released Grand Theft Auto shortly before this game found a new publisher and released. Not long after, the dev company changed their name to Rockstar.

It's certainly an interesting jumping in point to the Metal Gear series, it taking place after Peacewalker in the timeline of the franchise, there isnt alot to catch up on since you play as the legendary soldier himself, Big Boss. I also think you can read a report of what happened in Peacewalker in game if you are interested in lore.

The game itself, 20$ on steam, awesome price for a triple A title, in my opinion. The game itself can be as stealthy or as guns blazing as you want, however the game has learning AI so if you start sniping everyone around, the outpost will start deploying soldiers with helmets or better armour or counter snipers, you can also sabatoge supplies so that some smaller outposts cant get that body armour since it's not a priority. 

Like in assassins creed there are times when you cant stealth and just have to buckle down and get the biggest gun you can find and fight back, usually during boss fights or certain scripted scenes. 

Stealth, however is the name of the game, and as you develop a new base. You will need to capture and rescue people to help your base grow and develop new tools, weapons and vehicles.

It's a good time to mention that MGS5 also has an invasion mechanic where people can infiltrate your base and steal people and resources from it as long as their military power is close to your military power, you can also invade other players base by the same rules. It was a rarity when I played the game since the game had less players then so it shouldn't be a big issue. It's also an interesting test of stealth skill getting through the bigger bases, as military power is represented in how big the base is, the amount of military and how technologically advanced.

The only problem that you may not like about the game, and what others seem to dislike, is their Quiet time. However if you can get past her outfit and, ahem, odd behavior. I think you would enjoy this.

t6wzl2,hzercaf,t1_hze806q,"If legit, that's bound to a good move. After all, the melee combat in most Elder Scrolls games hasn't been all that great, at least in my experience.

I think it's partly due to the weak feedback, and partly due to the way Fatigue/Stamina/your Green Bar is handled. Compared to something like Dark Souls, the Green Bar in Elder Scrolls games regen WAY slower (5% per second outside of combat, and 1.75% inside combat, at least in Skyrim), so rather than back off and lower your guard to risk regenning your Green Juice, you have to pause time and scarf specific food items like Dio Brando raiding a picnic. And while some would argue that effects like Restore Green Juice would be useless if the Green Bar DID rapidly regen a'la Dark Souls, I reckon you could still have rapid Green Juice regen AND have Green Juice effects not be worthless.

Specifically, have the Green Juice rapidly regenerate, but as you exert yourself with more intensive actions like heavy attacks or blocks or fancy dodges or whatever, your green bar itself shrinks, meaning that you wear yourself out sooner as you continuously exert yourself during your adventures. Kind of like how your magic meter works in Dishonored. To mitigate this, Restore/Regenerate Green Juice would regrow the worn-out limits of your Green Bar, while Fortify Green Juice would temporarily make your Green Bar longer, meaning that those items are still very useful to an adventurer.

Though with that said, if Fortify Green Juice keeps your Green Bar longer for more than 4 hours, consult a doctor immediately, otherwise it might get rotten and drop off.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646452173.0
t6wzl2,hzfwrq4,t1_hzercaf,"I like this approach.

Another thing they could do to allow stamina potions to remain effective but also stamina to regen faster is what they do precisely in for honor.

As long a you have some stamina left it will regen quite quickly if you pause your attacks for half a second. But if you keep going until your stamina is depleted you will be out of breath, slower and your stamina will take several seconds to regen, more if you try to keep attacking.

This can force the player to pace themselves, use stamina potions as a last resort, while still keeping combat fairly fast paced, since you only need to take a step back every once in  while to regain stamina as long as you are not fatigated.

also to avoid just popping one potion after potion a being done, they can make it so stamina potions just take you out of the fatigated state.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646480062.0

Most games you just mindlessly slash your way through mobs until you get to a boss. In Souls games, each encounter must be met with caution and respect. The tutorial gives you the basics, you're expected to learn the rest through experimentation. And the story, while rich and complex, is delivered in more impressionistic and poetic fashion, which will turn off people that want to be spoon fed a good story and told exactly what to do. Cinema scenes are rare and short. Most storyline details are delivered with light touches thru item descriptions, npc interaction, graphical elements, **any** element in the game, really. Sometimes where you find something can speak volumes. (Digging for lore is my favorite part 😁) The games are infamous for being hard, and some fights can be quite challenging, but there's always options - a weakness to be exploited, an easier tactic, leveling up and coming back stronger, or summoning a couple sunbros to help take some heat.",4,0,0,False,False,False,1646495871.0

One hits a hard boss they can’t defeat and keeps trying persevering until they “get good”.  The other kind of player doesn’t see the point in beating their head against a wall if they’re possibly under leveled and decides to come back after gaining some stats. Elden ring is an excellent starting point on the genre for the second type of player. 

There are so many other directions you can go if you hit a wall. When I hit the first hard boss, Margit, I tried probably a twenty times to beat him and came close maybe once. I still haven’t gone back to beat him ten hours later. Not because I think I can’t but because I’m still exploring the other areas.

For context, about a year ago I had asked a similar question. I posted in r/Skyrim and r/gaming and asked about games like Skyrim that would be enjoyable, detailing what I liked about skyrim's basic structure. I got a lot of glowing recommendations for DA Inquisition, and another friend of mine who was always talking about the game. I bought in on sale on Steam, and started playing, and quickly became disappointed. The visuals were awesome, the story and intro were epic, and I was so excited to get out of the tutorial and explore the world with this unique origin... Jokes on me, though. The game was about as open world as a Mario game. Avoiding spoilers, the formula is basically to do everything that needs to be done in this specific region, then move on to the next. You don't get to interact with your backstory, which makes the fact that they give you one kind of a slap in the face, and your character creation choices only matter in how you look on screen and your role in combat. It honestly played more like a resource management game with a combat minigame than it did like an open world rpg.


What made it particularly frustrating for me was that I feel like I could have liked the game, if I had expectations built to what the game was, not what people said about it. It feels like everyone who talks about DA makes it out to be exactly what they think will get the other person to play it, but the actual bog down of go all the way back here, get a mission, navigate a small map around a huge battle or slodge through the battle, do a simple task, slodge all the way back through. If I wanted a very story driven game with narrow options that make little difference, I would have asked for that. If I wanted  resource management with extra steps, I would have asked for that. But I was looking for something like Skyrim, am open world rpg where I can just set out and ignore the main quest, enjoy the landscape, help people, settle down, build a house, fight as a soldier, become a hero, etc. DA Inquisition is more like ""be the hero within these constraints."" And I like games like that, when that's what I want, but I think I'm soured on DA for a long time.


TL;DR I don't think DA is a good equivalent to Elder Scrolls like games, and I feel like the people, online and off, that I talked to about it prior to playing wanked DA Inquisition to be whatever I told them I wanted out of a game.",0,0,0,False,False,False,1646505184.0

* Locate one of my original GameBoys and do some minor repair work (the battery terminals were badly corroded)
* Locate my old GameBoy Printer in my storage locker
* Discover that my old GameBoy Printer is totally dead and will need a full repair / restoration
* Replace GameBoy Printer from eBay
* Realize that I’d somehow lost the rare/unusual/custom cable needed to connect the GameBoy Printer to the GameBoy
* Spend a week searching online for a replacement cable
* Purchase replacement cable
* Realize that I’d purchased the *wrong kind* of replacement cable (I bought the one for the later GameBoy Color, which uses a different plug vs. the original / 1st-gen GameBoy seen here)
* Purchase *correct* cable
* Use cable to confirm that the printer works
* Discover that my entire hoard of ~30 year old Nintendo-brand thermal paper has lost its ability to thermally transition from white to black due to age
* Scour the Internet until I find a supplier of thermally-sensitive receipt-printer paper that is the correct width for the GameBoy Printer
* Use my GameBoy Camera to shoot a photo of the Reddit Snoo being displayed on my biggest computer monitor
* Print Snoo!

Millenials and people who grew up with Wiis will, once they have more time on their hands, ABSOLUTELY go bananas for an unopened Wii. Go buy one at goodwill if you want to play with one. They're everywhere.

But that will change, and you will absolutely be sitting on a gold mine. People bought these to use and discard. you have a relic that people will absolutely go nuts for in 15-20 years.

Keep it in the attic in a nice box. If you do decide to open it, I hope you saw and read this post. Please go to goodwill or wherever and pick up a used one. Its the same experience, except this sealed one is worth easily $600-1200 in 'a while'.

Look at E46 BMWs if you don't believe me. The prices were high, went into low 10s, then now they're going for 50-70-80k with no end in sight.

Burial at Sea, was fine but all it did was make me want to play the original games. I was so excited to see rapture again only to be met by uninspired stealth gameplay and lore inconsistencies played off by saying ""they take place in different universes""

I played both Bioshock and Infinite and to me Infinite was better in everyway. Yes infinite reduced combat options and ""RPG"" elements but bioshock games never had good combat. It's janky and spongy. 

The story of Bioshock deservingly gets praise however in terms of the main story it blows it's wad half way through, and the rest becomes a slog to revenge. Whereas Inifnite builds story momentum and ramps up and ends with a bang",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646451812.0
t6z0i6,hzfi2fi,t3_t6z0i6,"I don't think several of your criticisms are warranted.

On character motivation: ""Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt"" is great writing. For one, it concisely introduces a character's questionable moral compass and the first quest of the game. But the real neat thing it does is encourage the player to imagine the consequences for failure. What kind of monstrous consequences would Booker have to face from a group that kidnaps girls? It makes sense that Booker wouldn't feel compelled to ask too many questions.

On kidnapping: the threat and eventual abduction by the Bird is a major plot point in the game. Outside of the select few who understand her powers, why would any of the factions you fight want to harm her? The Vox only betray you for propaganda purposes. Fink is trying to recruit you. The Army vet just wants to die in battle.

An ordinary police officer is not going to try and forcibly abduct a religious idol in the middle of the firefight. They do not know she is trying to escape Comstock. For all they know she'll willingly go with them once Booker's gone.

On pacing: the lack of threats to Elizabeth herself explains most of this, but Booker is also rushing her at the Bay until the first fight. It's not unnoticed.

On the agreement with Fitzroy between tears: Elizabeth viewed tears as a form of wish fulfillment. The only reason the agreement would be broken is if the catalyst event the wish changed also changed the agreement with Fitzroy.

Moreover, everyone's skill levels are different. As long as you don't make the easier mode TOO easy, you can maintain difficulty and triumph that is more suitable to their skill level.

For example, I beat Margit in about 3 tries. Not amazing, but it's way better than I've seen a lot of people. Our experiences and difficulty with the games are already different. Some people take hours. There are people out there that would probably take days and just want an easier mode.

You're saying that death is part of the experience. That challenge and triumph is integral...but they would still have that. The point is that there *are* many games where that triumph does not come. The difficulty you have, that requires a few tries or a couple of hours might be what is 'intended', but some people are much less skilled than that and would then have an experience more par with yours by actually allowing them an easier mode.

From software are one of my favourite developers, and there's no reason to gate keep people from these experiences based on some gamer version of 'you must be this tall to ride'.

Currently own a PlayStation 4 and Nintendo switch and a pretty decently high powered PC.

As a Sony Fanboy I have to admit the best bang for your dollar is going to be an Xbox series x and game pass.

If you're not familiar with game pass it's basically a subscription service that gives you access to a ridiculously large number of games. There's no b******* to it either you pay the subscription fee you get to play the games.

Since you're unfamiliar with the hobby you may not be fully aware of the massive range of gaming experiences that are available.

A service like game pass will allow you to explore a wide range of different types of games different genres without having to spend money on individual games and possibly investing in something you're not going to find very fun.

Besides the Xbox Nintendo switch is a good secondary. The games are generally very approachable while simultaneously hosting a lot of indie games allowing for a pretty decently wide range of experiences. 

The problem with switch is that the games are expensive, switch games tend to not go down in price overtime. Legend of Zelda breath of the wild is like five or six years old at this point and is an amazing game don't get me wrong but it's still $60.

The main thing missing is the atmosphere and tension. Remember the first time you're forced out at night in 1, and get chased by the volatiles and it's fucking terrifying? So far in 2, the only forced interactions with them have been cutscenes and a couple of heavily scripted chases.

I might be doing something wrong, but night-time just isn't very threatening any more. You can get into trouble for sure, but there's so many safe zones around that you can usually get to safety without much bother. Volatiles are extremely rare in the ""wild"", so you can easily wait until night to raid their lairs, since they won't be there when you get there, and they won't be around outside either.

Although I will say that drop kicking absolutely everyone off buildings or onto spikes never gets old.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646321546.0

It sort of bothers me how long a reload boss fights take. Literally nothing has changed, just fill up the HP bar, reset its location, and let me at it.

I wonder if this is why they added the stakes of Merika and generally forgiving checkpoints.

It's a Soulsborne game, and I'd argue that's practically a genre in it's own right - one that isn't for everyone: It shares as much in common with things like Metroid, Ghouls n Goblins and roguelikes as it does the Action or Roleplay genres.

Elden Ring carries GRRM's association and is an open world game, which has drawn in players who are fans of one or both. Many folks I suspect expect similarities to Action-RPG games and whilst there are likely some, that's not how I see the game. On top of this, fans of the genre can be quite ebullient in their praise of the thing they love, which might have convinced one or two players: I know for example that hbomberguy's enthusiasm had me doubting my skepticism towards previous titles in the ""series"", for example: His video on the topic convinced me to purchase the last Souls game against my misgivings, and sadly it just confirmed that it isn't the genre for me.

Most of the valid criticisms I've seen pertain to the PC ""port""\*, and little things like the game not shipping with keyboard prompts and assuming the use of a controller. Souls players are probably scoffing at this, but it isn't that unreasonable for a PC-only player not to use a gamepad and therefore arguably fair for them to make this criticism.

Never played a Souls game and heard dying is expected, so I haven’t had the impetus to play them yet.

If a Q wanted to move a fleet of ships anywhere instantly (regardless of whether or not it was connected to the spore network), they could.  A navigator for the Spacing Guild has everyone park their ships in a big container... and then just makes that container appear wherever they want it to be.

Regarding their reporting, again, set your expectations. Most of their staff leans left, so their editorial decisions will lean that way. Still, they do go out of their way to get responses and statements from all sides of an issue, so there is that. But, you will definitely see, from the rhetoric, where the writer’s personal views land. 

Personally, I prefer when a publication wears its biases on its sleeve. It makes it really easy for me to divine the information I need, because I don’t have to first figure out what perspective is informing the writing. But YMMV.  

(Before anyone gets all “I want my reporting to have no biases”, grow up. No media is created in a vacuum.

We actually started getting games like two months before the launch, then the consoles themselves began showing up about a week before. We had this tiny back room and we had to find a way to stack everything in there...AND we had to make sure the door stayed shut, because we didn't want a customer seeing the giant stacks of blue boxes.

Because pre-ordering was a really new concept in those days, customers wouldn't understand what you meant when you said they were all spoken for. Some just got downright pissed off. We were also told that if we were caught accepting any bribes (i.e., I'll give you $100 if you just sell me one right now) that of course, we'd be instantly fired. lol

Editing to add to this:

If they did Call of Duty: Air Warfare, they could capitalize on reliving the battles they've already produced. If they just focus on aircraft missions paired with dropping off teams on the ground (where you get the special forces combat on the ground) I think it would be a banger.

C-130's, Apache, A-10 Warthogs, etc... doing cover missions, while dropping troops off on the ground during some missions would be my dream.

Now, I know you're a busy man, so I won't take up much of your time. Don't want there to be any hold ups, in the unforeseen event of total atomic annihilation. Won't take but a moment. Just need to get this pesky info all squared away! Wonderful! That's everything. Just gonna walk this over to the Vault!

Steam provides a key generator and you can produce as many keys to your heart's content. even when contacted by a lot of people if they can have a key to try out the game for game press. You have the ability to just gave them out like free candy. Steam does not charge you for any of those steam activations either, even if you decide to sell them on services like humble bundle, kinguin, g2a etc. You are not locked down to steam as a sales vendor and I'm sure other market places have similar policies, I can only speak for steam for now. You are welcome to sell them, give them out as freebies for marketing etc. Steam won't charge you for that.

What that means is a lot of the time you can message a developer directly and just ask. You'd be surprised how many developers especially small developers would just be happy you want to play the game. 

And just like with any other secondary income, you just keep track of your sales and complete a yearly tax you owe. Regardless of how you obtained the money. Whether it was through the steam marketplace, a secondary market place, or cash in hand.

See... as characters in the story learn about the world, so do we, the reading audience.  We, the readers, are exposed to a strange new world, and so are the characters we are following and reading about.  As they learn it, we learn it.

It is a type of storytelling based on the narrative coming from a  [Limited Third Person Point of View](https://tutors.com/lesson/third-person-limited-point-of-view).

>The third-person limited point of view allows the reader to be inside the central character's head. Everything in the story unfolds from that character’s point of view. The character whose point of view is presented by the author is the third-person limited narrator.

So it isn't lazy writing.  It is a valid, and often used narrative technique.  It is the most probable reason for why you are completely ignorant as to the world you are now looking at through the main character's eyes.... when you fire up the game for the first time.

The Return from the Dead idea... aka [Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany).... rising from the dead, or waking up from suspended animation, or travelling through time... these are all ways to introduce ignorance into the protagonist, so that they have something to learn about the world just like the reader does.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646440928.0

The only thing I actually have a problem with is people acting like the existence of an easy mode option would somehow tarnish the regular mode.  I see zero logic in that.  Tons of difficult games throughout video game history have had difficulty settings.  Double Dragon 2 and Mega Man 2 both have difficulty settings.  Mega Man 2 is often considered the favorite of the original series.  Actraiser 2 and Turtles in Time both do as well.  Actrailer 2 in particular is very, very difficult.  It didn't take away from the prestige of being able to complete them on the hardest difficulties.  Contra had the famous Konami code that made the game much easier.  Otherwise it is a brutal game.  One hit kills and lots of things on the screen all at once.  As a kid you'd play the game without the code to challenge yourself and show off to friends, and other times you'd play with the 30 lives code for fun.  The existence of one didn't negatively affect the other.

I don't really care what someone finds fun, but options are almost always a good thing.  I love a challenge.  I've beaten the original Turtles game, beaten the original Mega Man as well as Mega Man 2 on hard (and the rest of them, but those are the hardest), beaten Contra without continuing, gotten most of the way through Battletoads, and more.

Easy modes often do things like giving less rewards (Terraria, Diablo) and even if you can dial the difficulty down in game, then many times you can't put it back up. So the game gives you a warning if you want to lower the difficulty that you can't go back.

I would argue that climbing the mountain and succeeding, is a large part of the game's tone, or at least it was for Dark Souls where a lot of the story and characters are tragic figures who continue to persevere in a world that is terrible.

I think From wants the player to also feel that drive to persevere, so they developed an incredibly fair combat system and expect the players to master it or to find creative solutions around problems.

Dark Souls is of few games that I can say that you don't get screwed over by randomness, failure is usually because the player failed to learn the combat mechanics, or was too greedy in their attacks and was punished accordingly or was not good enough.

Now, is expecting mastery fun for the player that doesn't want to put in loads of time, no. But for those players there are projectile spells or summons to make things easier.

To add difficulty options like say the way that Jedi fallen order would offer an easy way to cheat the combat mastery process, which is something that From does not want.

I'd recommend selecting a build that has favorable stats into those areas you mentioned.

Dex is for bows, knives, curved swords, etc., and intelligence is for magic.  So a bandit class is pretty good considering, which is what I did.

But, don't let that define your whole playthrough.  The starting class only really matters in the beginning. You can pick any class and still work your way to a more specific build of your choice.

I think people are less opposed to making the game more accessible by making more accessible control interfaces and sensory affordances like a colorblind mode and directional subtitles, and more opposed to making a less difficult version of the game by changing cornerstones of the series such as menus that don’t pause, enemies you have to look around a corner to see, and boss fights that kill you for panic rolling and not timing things out.

Basically the souls like games are partially defined by their difficulty, changing that would change the core experience the games are designed around. If a game is too difficult to play for them despite having adaptive controllers and accessibility settings than they don't really feel like the game is inaccessible just too hard in general for their respective skill level.

Pandering to difficulty and calling it an accessibility issue for disabled people feels a bit insulting as well, one of those players for instance can rock all comers in Halo multiplayer and he regularly plays LASO runs with me, he's getting through Elden Rings no problem. The other guy doesn't play souls likes because they are too hard for him and part of that is his controller setup but the other part is general overall skill, he doesn't think games should get easy modes to make them accessible though.

With that said, this isn't representing all disabled people by any means just a small group.

Assassin creed games started falling short around the and its been a race to the bottom ever since. Finishing with Valhalla,  which is the largest disappointment ever imo.

Spend more time observing an enemy, play defensively (invest in getting a shield with 100% physical damage block), let them attack your shield, itll stagger them a little and you counterattack in the opening. 

If several enemies are grouped together, use a ranged weapon or item to lure one at a time. Be more tactical and you'll figure it out as you go. When you do figure out you'll get emotinally rewarded as well as material rewards like loot, runes and ragdoll physics to get a sense of revenge. 

Read all the stats. If you didnt do the tutorial cave at the start, try going back and doing it (place you wake up in after dieing the first time).

Some places are harder than others. Put a marker down on an area you had a hard time with, come back to it later. 

Read item descriptions. You'll find lore, hints and sometimes tips. Observe the surroundings areas, sometimes they hide enemies, story and player memes(good for a lark).

Windows literally gives you the option to pick the GPU to use by default for a given executable unless it specifically chooses its GPU.

> He has no idea what he is talking about.

Unless my 10400's iGPU is capable of 60 FPS in Cyberpunk, I would think I know something about this. Btw it's OK to say you've never seen a computer in your life before, which is pretty much the only way you would've never noticed that it's possible to select the GPU.

> Also, an integrated card has to use your RAM, so you'd be constantly copying, 60 times per second or more, the entire image into ram and then sending it.  It would also use extra CPU power.

DMA makes the copying itself to be pretty much free in terms of CPU cycles, although it does indeed pin down the memory. But copying about 33 MB of data (at 4K, assuming RGBA and 8 bits per channel) after every frame isn't really a problem at 60 FPS, it takes only about 1.7 ms per frame to transfer even with the lowest DDR4 at 2400 MT/s. Unless the game is heavily CPU bound, you won't see any meaningful difference other than the latency.

t76mhq,hzftnff,t3_t76mhq,"The Co Op is the same before, really its only meant to be used when going into a legacy dungeon or boss fight, it's not the kind of game where you frolick with friends in the overworld. The ingredient for the consumable grows like weeds. You can earn runes etc, but if host dies or you die your booted. The game designers did not design this game for 100% co op, it's designed to be played solo with the co-op used in trickier bits.

Its fully open world. It's not really like that western choose your own adventure Fallout/Skyrim game with factions and dialogue choices etc, but there are lots of side quests and multiple endings depending on the things you do in the game. It's completely non linear and you can do whatever you want in whatever order you want like Zelda or Shadow of Collusus. There's sort of a guiding light telling you where to go for the main mission, but you can ignore it completely. You can even completely bypass bosses by skipping areas, everything is 100% accessible after the tutorial area, although sometimes you have to figure out how to go around.

The large open area is filled with NPCs, Quests, bosses like dragons and ruins/forts/caves/catacombs to explore. Exploration is great because your constantly rewarded. Your not guided to any of this, it's not marked on your map and only discoverable from exploration. Events happen randomly in the open world as well. The soulsbourne design comes into play when you get to legacy dungeons and that's where it becomes more labyrinth like.

the gameplay is a little different, the addition of jumping attacks and horse combat are pretty nice, there is also a hidden posture bar for enemies (after you hit an enemy a certain amount of times it allows you for a ripost, heavy attacks/jumping attacks are the best choice for this with fully charged heavy attacks being the best when it comes to stance breaking, you will never get a stance break using only light attacks)

not sure about the performance because I don't play on a ps4

It is open world but it's not nearly as engaging as most other's in the genre. Often times you'll get to a land mark or the end of a path to find a generic crafting material waiting for you, if anything. The game wants you to grind in the open world so you'll spend a lot of time riding your horse, running circles around enemies who can't really fight back. 

The dark soul style areas are pretty good. The camera is terrible whenever it comes to flying or massive enemies, which is beyond frustrating. Bosses tend to rely on these really drawn out combos which make the gameplay less about skill and more about patiently waiting for your turn to hit them. 

You'll spend the first few hours of the game encountering enemies you do next to no damage to while you figure out where you're supposed to be. You're going to be stuck with your starter gear for longer than expected as well.

Didn’t need to twist it or manipulate anything, you did this all on your own. Games are an awesome thing, great hobby and a really beautiful art form. You equated your need to play some games with the bloodiest war Europe has seen for half a century. It’s disgusting.
