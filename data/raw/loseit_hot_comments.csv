t7fezt,hzhl660,t3_t7fezt,"With the changes I have made and the weight I lost I didn't really change the type of food I eat.   I just changed the quantity and timing of it.  This has led to overall smaller portions and getting away form the idea of continuing to stuff more food in there.    After 2.5 years of it I find I can no longer eat the same amounts of food as i used to.   So it is much easier to feel satiated but you are eating far less calories to do it.   

I have come to believe that most people really don't think much about how and why they eat.  They just do.    And this leads them to eat far more then they need to.   Sodas, alcohol, and other sugar filled drinks allow us to consume huge amounts of calories when we don't even realize it.    And this leads them to consume far more then they actually need.   And as we age we tend to either consume even more while our metabolism and activity levels drop.   This is why many people hit a wall at their late 30s and start gaining then even if they had been in decent shape up until then.    So it is not that middle age is the problem but your consumption that is.  

So I normally don't think about what I eat in the terms of I can't have X.   I just need to be aware that I can't have X 10 times a week or if I eat X I have to reduce elsewhere.    Diets largely don't work the same way exercise doesn't.    If you hate doing it then it is much harder  to maintain over your life.  You have to make it something you like or integrates easier.

t6we2c,hzft2f8,t3_t6we2c,"This is a long post, but I have some advice I really hope you take.

Down the road, it might be very very difficult to keep up the weight loss, as the low hanging fruit is gone, the 1300 a day seems to get harder/more restrictive and the motivation to do this strict diet tapers off. People plateau, it's gonna happen.

This is okay and normal, but please, when it happens, don't follow the advice of 'pushing through it', willpower is a limited resource (I say this as a person who also has ADHD). Instead, you got to work on what will be your eating pattern for the rest of your life. A diet is a temporary thing, it's something you gotta keep up for a while, but you're not gonna be counting calories and live at 1300 kcal the rest of your life. It could be that bc of PCOS and having been fat for a long time your metabolism is such that you will need to be on a slight deficiency for the rest of your life, say 1800, or normal intake but with some daily exercise, but it can't be a diet, that won't work forever.

Instead, it's gotta be sustainable, your automatic food choices are going to need to become right ones, cut out most sugar, fewer carbs, slower carbs instead of white rice, bread and pasta, add more veggies, add more protein, slow your eating down and intersperse with lots of water, do IF if you feel it could be sustainable for you, habitually ignore unnecessary cravings (when you're used to not give in to them they will become smaller). All these things will be conscious choices at first, but with time they will become habits, and thus not cost willpower. This is the path towards health, which is the real goal, where your eating habits nourish and support you. Only at this point is it wise, in my opinion, to restart the diet.

If when you plateau you are still overweight and thus need to lose more for health reasons, do so at a later time. But your fallback position when you can't do the diet anymore has got to be this sustainable healthy eating pattern.

So, here's a game plan:  
\- keep up your diet until the willpower starts to become low-  
 as soon as that's happened, put the willpower in eating habits instead, forget about the diet.  
\- when you notice that it's now easy to follow these habits....that's when they're actually habits, they're not costing you willpower anymore. It might take months before this happens, but when they are you are at a great place. This is when you can decide to diet more, if you still need to lose weight.  
\- as soon as the willpower is low again, you now have healthy eating habits to fall back to.

‚Ä¢ No refined carbs if I can help it (white breads and pastas) 
‚Ä¢ My medications Metformin and Spironolactone (when I first started met I only had side effects for two weeks and I‚Äôve had none since)
‚Ä¢ The right combination of supplements which are Vit D, Magnesium, B12, B6, Omega 3 fish oil 
‚Ä¢ Walking 6-10k steps a day (you‚Äôre doing wayyy more than this and I hope to get to your level one day)
‚Ä¢ Tracking calories 
‚Ä¢ Having an exercise routine that fits around the hormones in my cycle 
‚Ä¢ Releasing myself from the intense pressure to be at the goal weight asap which causes me to spiral into old problematic ED behaviours 
‚Ä¢ A breakfast high in fiber and protein 
‚Ä¢ Getting good quality sleep but also staying calm and relaxed throughout the day to keep cortisol at bay

t6we2c,hzgf1rg,t1_hzeitvs,"I agree.  

It's absolutely possible to maintain healthy weight and/or lose while having PCOS. I'm 51 and have PCOS and have never been overweight by BMI, despite having fucked up insulin function and severe reactive hypoglycemia.  I have been at the upper edge of normal BMI a few times in my life, and worked to lose that weight, and it didn't work that differently from any 'normal' person.  I gained by eating high calorie processed food and being sedentary, and I lost by eating more nutrient dense, lower calorie food and exercising a bit more.   


However, I've also lost weight a few times (mostly when I was young) while still eating absolute crap, carby food (this was prior to knowing that I had PCOS and should not be eating that way). So CICO still 100% applied for me, even when eating carb heavy, and even with PCOS.

No sweet drinks of any sort, and only dark chocolate for sweet cravings (but any sort, apart from ones with fondant etc - so nuts, glace ginger, mint chips, etc etc I used to mix up my blocks!) I only had coffee until midday - but I have never been big on breakfast. Healthy lunch, healthy dinner - I use a lot fo those high protein ready meals with a good carb and veg. Cheese and cracker pack for a snack. Also couple of bits of fruit a day for snacks too - but again, if I had a banana and an apple, I wouldn't ALSO have had cheese and crackers, you know? 

No traditional burger type fast food with fries ever. need takeaway? Subway small 6 inch with no dressing/sauce (prefer cheese, even their plastic sort) Use your head - don't pick stuff packed with mayo, meals and sandwiches with rich cream/mayo sauces, curries with coconut cream base, or HEAPS of nuts all the time. I refuse to count calories, as my brain wants to eat all of them etc - but I have done, so I have a good idea of a better choice in general when picking lunch at a deli/ordering at a restaurant.

The final thing is just keep going. Weight stalls for weeks sometimes, as shape changes - esp with the exercise I did. I had a phase where I lost nothing for weeks and weeks but everyone also started to comment I was looking better/have you lost weight? I was converting higher volume (fat) into lower volume (muscle) so size changes with minimal weight changes.

I have done it before, so can say that pcos seemed to make plateaus longer. Also, once a plateau is 4 weeks - look back on your week? I bet you will find you chose the once a week creamy sauce option more than once, had more snacks, was more social etc and that's why. So pull it in. Also, period due? ignore scales for a week prior, it'll just make you sad lol.

I also don't really drink, so that helps. I think you have to cut out alcohol apart from occasions really. Rather have more cheese, anyway.

Essentially, the same as anyone else does to lose weight. Just need to have a strong mindgame, to cope with the slow moments. And to carry on anyway.

final point - if you cannot stop yourself eating your feelings/craving sugar for comfort etc - look into why. This is not a healthy, normal coping mechanism, if you have the means think about therapy/support for other stuff in your life. Being aware of this can also help. I was chasing dopamine, eg.

I gained about 50lbs around the time of my Hashi's diagnosis. Was that all because of my thyroid? In a way. I got a specific variety that meant I did not convert T4 to T3 (in simple terms, a thing that makes energy), but to rT3 instead (in simple terms, a thing that increases all your stress hormones. All of them) and as a result I was exercise intolerant for 2 years until I got a doctor to give me the right meds. It was hell.

 The slowed metabolism caused me to gain weight, and then the complete lack of energy caused me to stop moving as much and gain weight, and then the fact that any amount of exercise caused me to feel like I had the flu (fever, incredible muscle aches, unable to move for 2-4 days, along with weekly migraines and panic attacks) made me gain weight, and then feeling like shit and being unable to follow my passion lead to depression and binge eating which made me gain weight. I also had to sleep 10 hours (only to wake up feeling like I pulled an all nighter) so thats 2 extra hours lying down instead of moving that made me gain weight. I clearly didn't decrease my intake accordingly. I had previously been certified as a PT and was looking for a job as a trainer too, I spent 10+ hours in the gym every week for years and I wanted to be a great powerlifter and jesus christ did my thyroid fuck me the fuck up.

It's not impossible, but a lot of people who are un- or undertreated are (understandably) not comfortable with taking certain measures to lose weight. Hunger and two hours of walking daily is more than most people are willing to do, and by societal standards, it's an eating disorder, which we are, of course, advised not to do.

By normal human standards, it was anorexia and orthorexia, but since my body was fucked*, that's what it took. When you have health complications, the metrics for ""normal"" shift even if the social narrative doesn't. In my case, it took a diagnosable level of anorexia to maintain weight because the DSM-5 was not created with abnormal health in mind, and that level of restriction actually was appropriate for my body.

So, when people claim that they can't lose weight with hypothyroidism, they probably mean ""without dipping into eating disorder territory"".

Period cycle and fitness
1. After period, follicular phase, oestrogen is rising so it‚Äôs easier to build muscle. Take advantage of increased energy. Do lots of weights. Don‚Äôt be afraid of long walks. Do 5KG DUMBBELL WORKOUT 3x A WEEK, LONG WALKS (2HOURS EACH) 2x, and YOGA 2x.
2. When ovulation phase comes around, social energy is increased and it‚Äôs a good time to get walking and exploring places. Still do some weights. You may find though that you need to pee all the time. You will also experience heavy water weight and a bit of bloating during this time. Do 5KG DUMBBELL WORKOUT 2x A WEEK, LONG WALKS 3x, and 2x YOGA.
3. Luteal phase is when oestrogen and ovulation hormones drop, and progesterone slowly starts to increase. Your energy takes a dip, so gentle activity is required to prevent burning out. This will lead up to PMDD phase, calming exercises will help with this. Food and digestion is slower during this phase so you will still experience weight gain and bloating, and possible constipation. Do 3KG DUMBBELLS 2x A WEEK, LONG WALKS 2x, YOGA 1x.
4. It‚Äôs period week, menstrual phase, and we‚Äôre bleeding and being achy. So rest and if you have to do something keep it gentle and low-key. Rest up queen. Just do LONG WALKS 3x.

In summary, for the first two weeks you can lift and walk and stretch and go! As you enter the last days of the ovulation phase you‚Äôre gonna bloat and begin to gain weight as hormones drop. Once the ovulation phase is over you need to ease off the intensity of physical activity, gentle walks and weights.

Winco plant protein powder, I haven't tried but may work better than the whey protein for you.

 I don't know if it's a personal anxiety of yours, worrying someone will ask you why you didn't finish all the food, or if it's a genuine problem with your friends. I lost a bunch of weight while still having meals with drinks and dessert at restaurants 4-5 times a week. I was silently making a note of how much I ate and drank and started making adjustments without telling anybody.

Packing away left overs was always normal. No one batted an eye when anyone at our table got a box to go, nor did anyone make a comment if I did end up eating everything on my plate. Every friend I have been with does this. It varies on where we're eating, what we're eating, and what their day has been like. Nobody judges anybody for eating all the food or packing it away, and nobody justifies why they made that decision for that meal. 

It worries me that this is such a stigma around this for you. That's something you definitely need to work on. You can have a social life and lose weight and maintain that weightloss. But you can't do that without making any change. Whether you add a bunch of hot sauce to make your food inedibly spicy, or you pack away food, stop ordering dessert, or not eat all day before your night out, or reduce calories by working out a lot more, that's up to you.

I‚Äôve started switching the activities I‚Äôm doing a bit to help - we‚Äôll binge TV / watch a movie at someone‚Äôs place instead of going to a restaurant every time (where I can more easily turn down food). 

I‚Äôd also say forcing yourself to eat very slowly helps with this too.

Even if you munch while you hang out, you‚Äôll have eaten less to start with so it should help.

These were some of the things that I did to help manage it much better when I did go out:

\- I could only purchase alcohol or food with the physical money. So if I have $20 in my wallet, that was effectively the limit on what/how much I could buy. It was easy for me to enforce it with my friends because they are all cash people as well, and it also helped me reign in drinking (which for me was a major source of my weight management issues). 

\- I started advocating for more variance in activities. Instead of restaurants, I'd pick activities (e.g. hiking, concerts, movie theater, bar or lounge over restaurant, nights at the museum type activities). Basically places that weren't food focused and where there was an emphasis on an activity, not on eating (For the record, movie theaters aren't really dangerous for me cause I don't like theater popcorn, don't like soda, and I have a snack that I prefer to bring to them -- in your case, you can alter this to be like ""I'm going to get one order of popcorn and a small soda"" or however you want to balance it out). That, combined with the first tip, really helped a lot and I discovered a few people in my friends group who also felt the same way about always doing restaurants.

\- Depending on the occasion/where we were going, I would eat a small meal before I went out. So a bowl of soup or small salad -- something to take the edge off, and would prevent me from feeling like I needed to eat things like bread, chips, or appetizers when I got there. I was also more inclined to eat smaller portions when I actually got to dinner.

\- Know what you're ordering before you go. If I knew the restaurant I was going ahead of time, I would give myself two or three options of what to order and how to order it before going. That way I didn't need to look at the menu, have a rough estimate in my head of what to eat, and it gave me enough variance that I could make up my mind when I got to the restaurant. This also works if you don't know where you're going too -- just say ""I want chicken, that's what I feel like, and I want at least one type of vegetable as a side dish.""

t6qb3h,hzdddcw,t3_t6qb3h,"> Do I have to stop being social and seeing friends to lose weight?

Absolutely not. You just have to prep for it and get ready to minimize damage. So to speak. 

For example if I know I‚Äôm going to be out at dinner I‚Äôll change the rest of my day to eat frugally within my budget. Like breakfast will be oatmeal with protein powder and fruit (300-350 cal) and lunch will be veggies and chicken with a cheese sauce (400 ish calories). That way I know I have like a thousand calories to burn when I‚Äôm out. Most restaurant meal portions are still more than a thousand calories but the leeway makes it reasonable. 

Really losing weight is pretty simple. It‚Äôs learning how to live at that lower weight that‚Äôs difficult. I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs best to treat these adventure as learning opportunities. Like a test. Can I actually live like this in real life? Yeah, I can. So can you.

> In the last week, I've seen friends and had dinner with people 5 times. 

That would feel a bit excessive for me. How about suggesting eating with your friends at a house. It‚Äôll save money and you‚Äôll have more control over your food. Just a thought. 

The real problem with restaurant food is it‚Äôs really really unpredictable when it comes to calories. If the chef decides to throw an extra dollop of butter and an extra splash of heavy cream into the soup you could be looking at a 200-250 calorie swing just in that one soup. So in one meal you could eviscerate your deficit for the day. 

That‚Äôs not too bad if you only eat out once a week because if you break even one day but the rest are in a deficit you‚Äôll still trend downward for the week. Eating out every single day compounds that uncertainty. 

> This isn't exactly abnormal. 

Contemporary Americans do eat out like 5-7 times a week on average. But the average contemporary American is also overweight. So you can weigh that with the appropriate serving of salt. What has become normal isn‚Äôt always what‚Äôs healthy or sustainable. 

> I usually see people 3-5 days a week, and seeing people means eating dinner together. 

You don‚Äôt have to answer but my immediate thought would be is there is a reason for this or did you just fall into that convection? Why does it have to ‚Äúmean eating dinner?‚Äù

Have you considered attending a sporting event, or going to a museum? Maybe you could take a pottery class together or toss a frisbee around at the park. Maybe just walk around the city on a photography expedition? Go go carting? Not all friendly encounters have to revolve around food. 

> And I love food. 

Don‚Äôt we all. 

> And I love going out to eat. And I'm trying so hard to keep my portions small, but it's really difficult. 

You can ask the server to only give you a half portion. You can ask for a doggy bag or to-go box as soon as you get the food so you can put it away. I do this with burgers and French fries. I just cut everything in half and put it away for dinner tomorrow. 

That‚Äôs easy for me to do because I‚Äôm not eating out again tomorrow but you can make due. Worse comes to worse just have them throw it away. It sucks but it‚Äôs better than the alternative. 

> It's hard to say no to dessert. 

If you‚Äôre out with friends you can share the dessert. Order one for the table. Everyone gets a bite. I‚Äôve even done this at work events and it went over beautifully. The best thing about the ‚Äútable dessert‚Äù is mentally you know it‚Äôs not ‚Äúyour dessert‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúour dessert.‚Äù So you won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôll need to finish it. Everyone gets a bite or two to get a taste. Everyone goes home happy. 

The other thing i do is if I know I want a dessert, and I want it all to myself then I just build my day around it. I set aside the required calories, I walk into the restaurant and I order my dessert. I used to have a mental trap where I would think that I had to order food or it would be wrong somehow. It‚Äôs bullshit. You can just order a desert. You don‚Äôt need to eat an extra thousand calories of food to justify ordering the thing you want. Skip the dinner and go straight to the thing you want if it‚Äôs that important to you. If the rest of your day was solid and nutritious then you‚Äôll be fine. 

> I literally can't keep my hands off my plate even when I'm ""done"" eating. 

Put the napkin on top of the plate covering the food and call the waiter over to get it the hell away from you then. You‚Äôre in control. 

> These situations feel so good and I just mindlessly eat. 

And here is where I would suggest professional counseling. Therapists have techniques they can teach you for handling these situations. The truth is your brain is having a massive dopamine response to food and you are stuck in a bit of a feedback loop. They can help you shake that. 

> The only way I can regain control is if I specifically choose a restaurant where I don't really like the food or we pick a place that has a healthy leaning menu. 

Then choose those restaurants. If these people really are your friends they will support you to the end of the earth. Knowing you are struggling with weight loss and letting you choose the restaurant is such a minor trivial concession to help a friend I can‚Äôt imagine any human being not complying with it. 

> These aren't always options though. My friends don't want to eat at those places all the time. 

How about they go there on the days where you‚Äôre not eating with them? If your dinner with friend-X is on Monday then go to a restaurant you feel comfortable in on Monday. Then friend-X can go to their restaurant Tuesday through Sunday while you‚Äôre out with your other friends. You are not in control of their lives. You‚Äôre only responsible for yourself. 

> I try to drink a bunch of water, but it only helps so much. 

Agreed. I think any more than a glass or two with a meal is excessive.

> If we're sitting around for 2 hours, I'll have emptied my stomach of water many times over but I still want the excess food that's sitting around.

Then get rid of it. Don‚Äôt let it sit around. 

> Please don't recommend packing food away. 

Honestly my recommendation is to stop going out to eat so much. It‚Äôs clearly not an environment conducive to your success and comfort. One of the things we do best as humans is we don‚Äôt just live in an environment we shape our environment to our benefit. You need to do the same. Use your conscious mind to select environments that play to the strengths of your unconscious mind. 

> I'm not in the business of telling my friends I'm trying to lose weight or making it obvious.

I don‚Äôt want to be an old man lecturing anyone on the internet but the entire point of having friends is to build a close intimate support structure. It‚Äôs okay to let your friends be that for you. More than okay it‚Äôs healthy. It will let them grow closer to you as a person. It will strengthen your bond. If you let them be a part of your struggle you let them be a part of your victories. 

My friends are well aware of my struggles. They send me articles and podcasts about weight loss. They recommend YouTube channels. Just last month my friend recommended I get a Fitbit because he got one from his wife and was seeing benefits. So I bought one on his recommendation. We‚Äôve been comparing Fitbit stats every day this month. That‚Äôs what friends are for. In good times and bad times. 

> I have lots of reasons. But if anyone has any practical tips, please let me know.

Understand that it‚Äôs okay to be honest and vulnerable with your friends. Let them know your concerns and goals. Let them be a part of the solutions. Give them the opportunity to help you with your problems in the same way you would help them. 

If you had a friend that was trying to quit smoking would you suggest hanging out with them at a cigar club? If you had a friend who was a recovering alcoholic would you suggest meeting with them at a whisky tasting? Of course you wouldn‚Äôt. Those are environments where your friends would be uncomfortable at the very least and could flat out cause them harm at worst.

Longer answer: there are a wealth of methods you can use to fit going out into your caloric balance, although you will need to be somewhat transparent.  You don't need to shout ""HEY GUYS, I'M TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, but it may be fairly apparent, and that's totally fine.

1. Drink a lot of water right before you go out.  Eating an apple or a salad beforehand can also help you feel fuller.
2. Prioritize protein.  Don't go for the pasta with marinara sauce, don't get the fried option, don't get the starchy mains.  Get the chicken, get the white fish, get the turkey, or the duck, or whatever.  Protein should be the center of it.
3. Avoid dressing or oil.  Don't get the salad dressed, or with avocado, or with bacon.  Get the salad that's all veggies, and use a spicy mustard, or a self-administered lite dressing, which you can then use in very small quantities.
4. Nothing fried.  The oil in those foods can double or triple the calories of something that might otherwise be healthy.
5. More green than brown.  If you're getting potatoes or quinoa or something on the side, get a serving of broccoli or cauliflower, or asparagus, or whatever that is bigger.  Two bites of green for each bite of brown.
6. Finally, and this is key: EAT SLOWLY, and STOP WHEN YOU'RE FULL.  If you eat past satiety, these strategies become much less effective.  Don't worry about the proverbial starving children in Africa - the leftovers from your single plate weren't going to them anyway.

Ultimately, you will probably need to limit doing out.  I do it at most once a week, and I have my weight under control.  For someone actively trying to lose, I wouldn't do it more than once a week, because those trips will add up significantly, even if you do everything right, because ultimately, there's no point in going if you can't enjoy yourself a bit.

t7g9fr,hzhihkg,t3_t7g9fr,"Weight loss really does come down to the number of calories you consume. 

I lost the weight thanks to My Fitness Pal and a food scale. Part of what I've learned thanks to planning and tracking what I eat is how to make lower calorie substitutions that are still satiating; Greek yogurt mixed with chocolate protein powder, chia seeds, and fruit for breakfast, rather than two bagels with cream cheese - the Greek yogurt with everything mixed in has less than half the calories of those bagels, but I'm more satiated thanks to the protein and the fiber. The food scale helps with portion control; it's almost like a safety net - when I make spaghetti for lunch (black bean spaghetti - more protein and fiber than the regular stuff, so it's more satiating), I weigh out 56 grams of the stuff real quick before I cook it; this ensures I'm eating enough without eating too much. 

If you approach it with an open mind and without judgment, it can be a really positive tool in helping you take control of your weight.

4. Find your triggers that stop you from succeeding. Others can explain it better than me, so I‚Äôll give you my example.

The trick is to find what works for you. What can you get behind and really dedicate yourself to? Maybe it's walking more each day, or setting a calorie goal that's a few bites below maintenance, or simply adding a fruit or veggie to every meal. If you've found yourself struggling to stick with your plans in the past it's likely you were trying to do too much all at once. Try something smaller this time. Like you said, you have time.

Since the start of the year I have been focusing on eating better for my health instead of my calorie count, which means balanced meals and snacks all day instead of having lettuce for lunch to make room for a chocolate binge after dinner.

At the same time I have been working out for strength and endurance instead of to make room for sweets or to punish myself for food choices.

t7998v,hzg7xrf,t3_t7998v,"You can do it, and I am glad you posted here. 

A lot of your story resonates with me. I was also a fat kid who had misguided adult interventions- got sent to Jenny Craig, the Atkins diet, family tragedy when I was 15-16. My weight never really swung wildly; I was obese at 12 and graduate gained a few pounds a year until my early 30s, and maxed out at 280. It sucked. 

I also felt like I missed a lot of life, or had to experience it out of order. I remember reading weightloss forums in the early days of the internet while my peers were sneaking out drinking (or just, in general doing more age-appropriate stuff). I felt very lonely and very excluded. 

Like you, I hit some normal milestones; graduated from a university or two. Got a career. Got married. But losing weight just seemed impossible. Not for me. I‚Äôd read about people complaining about how hard it was to lose 20 pounds, and would WISH that was my biggest problem. 100 pounds or more seemed impossible, the kind of stuff that only happened in lifetime original movies, or in those people magazine issues, where they‚Äôd find someone who had given up their normal life, committed to eating grilled chicken and salad for a year, and now runs ultramarathons. That is to say, none of the ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù sounded like actual people. As an actual person, this was always very disappointing. 

But I posted here. I read the sidebar (the Quick Start Guide). I tried. I am still here, 4 years later, and I did it. I am a normal person who struggled their whole life, and there wasn‚Äôt a huge dramatic lightbulb moment. I just kept trying. I didn‚Äôt even care why I had stayed fat, I wasn‚Äôt in it for the emotional journey (that eventually happened, because, how can it not), but for a long time I was just here with one mission: be aware about what I was eating. Write it down. Be honest. Log the good days and the bad days. Just, finally *deal with this shit.*

I did deal with it. It took a long time. I did not lose weight quickly. I still do not have a healthy BMI (it‚Äôs about 26-27). On days like today, I give zero fucks about that: because the point isn‚Äôt a magic number on the scale or a medical chart. 

The point is that YOU CAN DO THIS. You can make the beginning ripple of changes now that will compound into gigantic waves of ‚Äúwhoa, my life is totally different now.‚Äù 

Being fat and angry is real. I‚Äôm not going to tell you to channel it into lifting weights or whatever. I am going to tell you that I understand the absolute fury that underpins feeling like you are ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from everyone else. Like you are forced to watch life happen on earth as an observer, from some stupid orbital pod that someone, once, stuck you inside of, completely without your consent, and with no clear instructions on how to get out of it. So you just sit there, glumly orbiting earth, watching people make funny TikToks, wish they could fit into their high school prom dress again, or get phone numbers on napkins from a cute guy at the bar. It‚Äôs like endlessly watching a movie, while everyone else has -if not a starring ‚Äî at least a SPEAKING role. So, I get it. 

You can do this. Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/mzmjbg/day_1000_journeys_end/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)to my whole story and my whole journey, chronicled as it happened, here on r/loseit. I hope it helps you to know that you aren‚Äôt alone, and that yes. Things really can change. It gets better.

Edit: you might consider checking out the Brain over Binge podcast and book. I know it has helped a lot of people here who struggle with binge eating.

t7998v,hzh15r6,t3_t7998v,"Hey I don‚Äôt think you will get what you‚Äôre looking for here. Here it tends to be a bunch of fix it people, they will only give you solutions. 

I am a therapist and what I love about my job is offering people a place to just SIT in the darkness. Because nobody wants to do that for other people. People don‚Äôt often want to acknowledge that life often puts us in binds or feels like a trap. Being born a woman into this world, you are automatically in a position where your body is trapped- trapped by body standards, diet culture, etc etc. suicidal ideation is often simply an expression that someone is in deep pain that they feel trapped by or can‚Äôt escape from. 

Being in a body that seems like you can‚Äôt control or is betraying you or makes life difficult, can feel like you‚Äôre trapped. ‚ÄúIf only‚Äù I could lose the weight then my joints wouldn‚Äôt hurt but my joints hurt so I can‚Äôt lose the weight. That kind of thing. To make things worst, your body was only small enough to be acceptable or desirable during times of deep deep grief, loss, trauma. That must compound the out of control or trapped feeling‚Äîif im going to lose weight, how on earth do I do it, because all I‚Äôve ever known is doing it because I don‚Äôt have an appetite.

I think our culture teaches us that our bodies, our appetites even, are uncontrolled monsters we constantly need to be afraid of and keep in cages. Watch out! That extra spoonful of peanut butter will be your undoing. What a miserable life to live if every piece of food we pass by is a threat. If our body is something scary to control, not something immensely wise and powerful to ally with. 

You deserve someone to sit in the darkness with you and scream at oblivion with you. This shit is fucked up!!! Life! Society! The fact that you have lost two huge people in your life?!?! What the actual fuck. You should be angry and sad. And body and food things seem so hard. And they fucking ARE for many people. You just want relief. 

I‚Äôm not here to give you dumb encouragement or dumb solutions or be your cheerleader. Who the fuck only wants a cheerleader when they‚Äôre in a dark cave? Fuck that. Has anyone even seen inside Out (the movie)? I‚Äôm just here to say, shit sucks. Doctors SUCK and don‚Äôt actually help fat people. 

I hope you can find someone to talk to you who lets you be everything that you are- a friend, an actually good therapist. If they‚Äôre a good therapist, they will NOT be uncomfortable with your dark feelings, they will encourage them and empathize with them. They will ascribe to *correct* HAES philosophies, which basically just wants people to treat their bodies as their Allies, and are aligned with intuitive eating. Intuitive eating is so magical to me. It‚Äôs magical to me how, I put a bunch of foods in front of my toddler (‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and one or two ‚Äúnot healthy‚Äù, nothing is off limits) and watch her only eat one food at one meal, or even all day! One day she only eats raspberries or muffins, And then the next day, she doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with the raspberries and only wants eggs and broccoli. I see it in myself too, if I actually let myself believe I can have all foods- man im really craving some fats right now like cheese and nuts. I have some and then im done! It‚Äôs great.

If you want to try something different, I would recommend the book, ‚Äúthe body keeps the score.‚Äù It‚Äôs about how trauma is literally stored in the cells of our bodies. It sounds like your life has been extraordinarily difficult. You deserve someone to not focus on your weight for once, and instead to hear your story. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong im still 5‚Äô10‚Äù 230- have been for a year ever since gaining 60lb during pregnancy and never losing it. Seriously, none of it came off (except the actual weight of the baby/placenta- so 15lb). But the birth was incredibly traumatic and I suffered a permanent injury that left me with incontinence. I‚Äôve essentially felt trapped in an out of control body ever since. I finally scheduled a repair surgery a few weeks ago, the surgery is in 2 days, and interestingly, without changing a single thing about my regimen, I lost 5lb in the past week. I‚Äôm trying to remain neutral about it but I feel excited that I may be seeing the real life effects of my body anticipating the exhale of relief I may finally feel if the surgery is successful. All I know is, everything I know about my life and my clients is, the body keeps the score. And that trauma (in the form of fight-flight-freeze psychological responses) has REAL impacts on our hormonal balances, our inflammation, how our body makes insulin, etc, all of which influence weight. It‚Äôs not all CICO. I see your weight as evidence of the deep pain your life has been marred by, as a battle wound, as evidence of how much pain you carry; rather than as evidence of weakness or lack of ability to carry. I see weight and binging as a red flag that hey im clearly outside my window of tolerance, and that means I need to re-examine my life or introduce more behaviors that honor my body because it‚Äôs stretched past it‚Äôs limits.

Ok so this is going to sound like some tough love stuff but know what worked for me? I stopped waiting for some catalyst or magical motivation to appear, and just started putting in the work. Slogging through it, day by day by day. Buy the things, use the app, log the calories, stay in budget. 

I got pissed off at my body hurting all the time at ‚Äúonly‚Äù 40 years old and having heartburn all the time, or not being able to climb stairs without panting. I realized I didn‚Äôt want to live the next 30 or more years like that, no matter what it took. Then I accepted the fact that I am simply not a human whose weight will miraculously either drop or stay stable no matter what I eat or how. Now I think of my weight like a medical condition I have to manage, like how some people have to take medication everyday for chronic conditions (which I don‚Äôt, yet, so things could be worse - something I also remind myself). 

Also FYI that beyond dog walks or mowing the grass type movement, I didn‚Äôt do real ‚Äúexercise‚Äù until I got down 30lbs to around 200 lbs and yet the weight still came off. I actually like exercise but my feet and joints hurt too much at first. Didn‚Äôt matter, still lost weight. Just weighing everything I ate on a food scale and sticking to my budget on the Lose It app (set to lose 1lbs a week which is what happened). I did NOT do keto or IF or anything like that because I question their sustainability (for me). 

Yes I had to cut down on the cocktails and eat more protein and fiber. Also stopped eating out / ordering in and I pack a lunch everyday for work. Honestly it‚Äôs that simple. Now I think of it (food scale + logging food) like brushing my teeth - I don‚Äôt *love* doing it but I don‚Äôt HAVE to love it, I just have to DO IT, if I want to keep nice teeth in my face.

You don't need to be in competition to lose The Most Weight Ever every week or have to stand in the front of some shitty slimming world group getting shamed by a stranger who interrogates what you ate. 

If you want to do this, you can. The only thing that ever really worked for me is forcing myself from ""I need to diet"" into ""what can I do that's the kindest thing for my mind and body?"" and for a long time it felt disingenuous because my mental health was in the gutter. It felt really pointless. But doing it anyway, standing in a supermarket going ""I'm really craving crisps. My mouth and my heart really want them."" and being kind to them, getting a 25g packet and enjoying them without guilt instead of depriving them was so much more productive in stopping binge eating a whole tub of pringles than bullying myself about it. Being kind was also finding what I _enjoyed_. I'm not a salad person (occasionally is fine). I'm an egg person. Cheese. Mock meat. Eating stuff I looked forward to and was excited to get was so valuable.

I also had a lot of resentment that I would have to care about something that (I assumed) many other people did not, forever. It seemed very unfair. Maybe it is unfair. I have absolutely no data on how many people have to care about their weight. 

Considering, however, this sub is in the top 25 of subscribers, the number is higher than I probably think. It doesn‚Äôt seem like everyone else is busting out a calorie logging app, but, then again, people I have met recently also have NO idea that I have ever struggled with my weight. People are shocked upon finding out that I still think about it. 

I don‚Äôt know how many people have to care the way you or I might. But I do know that everyone has to care about something. No one has a perfectly easy life. It‚Äôs not a lot of comfort when you‚Äôre mad about X being hard to be told that Y (which is easy for you) is hard for someone else, so I‚Äôll lay off that. 

Maybe it is just helpful to know that many people: especially in here (but also out in the real world) also have to care about what they eat.

There are a thousand different ways to do that: surgery, fad diets, intermittent fasting, exercise, but you can't get around it. You can mix and match and charge around as you go.

Maybe you should focus on stabilizing your weight instead of insistent trying to lose weight, and slowly adding in bulky, healthy foods to get you ready to ease into a deficit.  Even something like committing to one day a week to start can get the ball rolling.

Yes, some are blessed with magic genetics but me resenting that is like being angry that I‚Äôve had to wear contacts since 8th grade while some had perfect vision always/still. What would be the earthly point of that? Not their fault nor mine. Just the way we are.

At 41 myself I now know and have have seen a lot more than I had just 10 years ago. People I loved have died due to their poor lifestyle choices for weight and health. People once healthy are now way overweight and on all kinds of medications. Chronic time-consuming conditions (diabetics etc) exist that I didn‚Äôt even know were a thing.  

In comparison me spending less than a half hour a day total portioning and logging my food just isn‚Äôt a big deal anymore to me, in the grand scheme of things. Perspective.

There was no point trying to lose more (which I‚Äôve just started recently to do this winter) when I knew I‚Äôd just gain it back, again. That whole time I kept logging, working out, sticking to (maintenance) budget calories. And it worked, which blew my mind and gave me confidence I never had before. 

I couldn‚Äôt recommend ‚Äúpracticing maintenance‚Äù more, honestly. Learning to maintain is SO much more important than losing. Maintaining is a lifelong skill.

Go to r/volumeeating abs r/mealprepsunday and learn how to cook. Not just chicken and steamed veggies but actually cool tasty filling satiating foods. Trust me it won‚Äôt be hard to out cook chicken, eggs and cabbage.

Why do this? Because if she likes what she eats it won‚Äôt matter how slow her progress is because she will know she can do it the rest of her life. You say she‚Äôs lost about a pound a month. Cool. Keep that up. In a year she‚Äôll be 113 lbs. the reason she‚Äôs frustrated is probably because she‚Äôs suffering. She‚Äôs sacrificing. She‚Äôs restricting. She‚Äôs not having fun. You can not eat chicken, sweet potato and cabbage for 4 months and have fun. Even crazy body builders don‚Äôt go on a ‚Äúbro cut‚Äù like that for 4 straight months. 

> She's been down lately cause she hasn't seen the results she wants and I want to help her.

Do you have a good kitchen scale? That would be a great place to start. Then learn to make anabolic ice cream.

> - She's been eating an average of 1200 calories a day during that time, now recently averaging 1000 calories a day.   I'm worried her daily intake is too low.

It is highly unlikely that she is actually eating 1000-1200 cals a month for 4 months at that exercise frequency and isn‚Äôt losing fat. My suggestion would not be to call her out on it though. It will piss her off. Instead you should start learning how to count calories with her. Weigh everything to the gram. Log everything you eat and drink in an app and review it with her. Pay attention to serving sizes. Then maybe you‚Äôll be able to see where things are going astray with her process. 

> - She exercises at the gym (90 minutes) 3-4 times a week.  

Jesus. That‚Äôs intense. I top out at about 45 minute at the gym and I‚Äôm floored. Again don‚Äôt call her out on this but go with her to the gym. Observe. Is she actually working out hard for 90 consecutive minutes? Is she dripping sweat? Heart racing 110+ bpm? Is her lifting taking actual physical effort or is she going to the gym and hanging out. Again, I‚Äôm not judging and you shouldn‚Äôt either. But it‚Äôs every common that people go to the gym and do 90 minutes of ‚Äúintense weight training‚Äù and you ask then what they did and it‚Äôs 10 minutes of exercise bike, 3 sets of bench with 20 lbs dumbbells, 3 sets of leg presses less than half their body weight, and then some bicep curls. And it took them 90 minutes.

Then they enter it in the app and it says they burned 450 calories so they go eat back 450 calories when they probably burned 50. 

Btw: If she‚Äôs been eating back her calories this is probably the culprit. People are terrible at judging calories burned in exercise. 

> - She's in her early 40s, 160cm (5'3),  57kg (125lbs) now, 58 (128lbs) kg when when started 4 months ago.  

Congratulate her on starting this process and on  her amazing success. She‚Äôs lost almost 3% of her total body weight. That‚Äôs a damn good start. 

> Truthfully she's led a very inactive office worker's life + unhealthy diet before she started.

Pretty common. But she saw the problem and made a change. That‚Äôs amazing. Superb. 

> She's been trying really hard these days, eating mainly chicken breasts, eggs, sweet potatoes, cabbages, apples, nuts etc.  

She could be eating so much more fun things. Nothing against chicken but there‚Äôs also turkey, beef, bison, pork, duck, tuna, crab, crawfish, etc. Hell, there‚Äôs more to a chicken than the breast. Chicken thighs are delicious. This marketing bullshit from the 90s where the only healthy meat was ‚Äúwhite chicken breast‚Äù is just some nonsense to convince people Subway was health-food. Cheese is a decent source of protein and fats. 

Eggs are good. Love ‚Äòem. How‚Äôs she making them? How about you whip up an egg white omelet with wilted spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tomato? How about you mage eggs Benedict with low calorie hollandaise sauce?

Sweet potatoes are good but don‚Äôt short change regular old potatoes. Russet potatoes literally take the top spot in every single study for satiety index. That means you eat it and it satisfies your hunger. Learn how to mage your own broiled potatoes, baked potatoes, bake French fries in the oven with a short blast of pam instead of deep frying. Use golden potatoes, purple potatoes, yams, parsnips, etc. 

Cabbages‚Ä¶ I got nothing. All I can think of is the cabbage merchant from Avatar the Last Airbender. I can tell you that when I was a kid in the 90s they used to torture women by telling them to go on cabbage soup diets. Basically starving themselves to death. Again, it was just horse shit bro science nonsense. 

Apples are good. Also fold in strawberries and blueberries. They are all high volume low calorie foods. I particularly like plane Greek yogurt with frozen blueberries and a teaspoon of sweetener mixed in. To make a meal of it mix in half a scoop of protein powder. Oatmeal with blueberries and a bit of protein powder is also a very quick incredibly filling meal. 

Nuts are a tough one. They are incredibly calorie dense foods. 1/4 cup of almonds has over 200 calories in it. That‚Äôs barely a handful. I use nuts incredibly sparingly. Like maybe a tablespoon full of crushed almonds on top of protein pancakes with Greek yogurt. I‚Äôd suggest just backing slowly away from the nuts unless you‚Äôre eating it as a dessert. 

> Any advice would be great. Thank you.

It's really hard to lose the 5 lbs when you already are a healthy weight.

The best way for me is not any lenthly fasting, but eating 3 meals a day and keeping my macros around 35% fat, 45% carbs, and 20% protein. I do CICO as well.

Seriously, losing weight is like wringing out a wet towel. If the towel is overweight or obese with water, a little wringing goes a long way. However when the towel has only a little excess water, it's really hard to wring it out. So, the methods of losing weight for those who are overweight don't work when you're already in a heathy weight range.

She might have to do a few weeks of regular eating because her metabolism is really wound down right now. She needs to raise it back to a healthy level - she also needs the macros and micronutrients she's been missing for months.

Biological women who lift don‚Äôt typically bulk up in the same way or even at the same rate as men, because they don‚Äôt have testosterone factories in between their thighs. Instead what happens is their bodies release fat loss hormones, and as their muscles tone up the way that they *are* capable of toning up, their posture improves, areas like the buttocks and breasts become less saggy due to muscle development underneath, and the waist shrinks, which creates a more slender and pronounced figure.

Your metabolism will need to adjust to new daily intakes and while that happens your body has no desire to let go of fat. 

This is why people who starve can't simply ""eat"" their way back, a little not-so-known sad fact is that those concentration camp photos of starving jews that were rescued by allies or at the end of the war? a lot of them ended up dying because their bodies had passed recuperation points, their organs were in late-stage failures, their major systems were all messed up. Enough damage and it doesn't just bounce right back. In most cases the body tries to conserve fat as much as it can while wasting away muscle, bone etc

People who do drastic cuts undergo something similar, they tend to gain back weight really fast because their metabolism goes through these extremes. It's much safer and better to do a somewhat conservative cut and maintain as much as you can. That amounts to somewhere between 0.5 lbs a week, which unfortunately is not as glamorous for a lot of people but most who stick to the ""slow and steady"" approach tend to be able to keep it longer as the lifestyle shift isn't as severe. 

&#x200B;

Part B of your question. You don't need to count calories if you know roughly what you are consuming. Much better to track but to each their own. 

What you need to do is figure out your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). TDEE is how many calories you are burning at your current weight with your current activity lifestyle (in your case I think it's safe to say heavy activity suits it). BMR is how many calories you burn by simply existing, so if you sat on your ass all day this is what your body will be utilizing to keep you alive. 

[https://tdeecalculator.net/](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

[https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html)

Keep in mind that these are not exact measurements but a rough idea of where to go. 

If you don't own one of those smartwatches that tells you how many calories you burned for your exercises. Here is a general idea link for steps converting into calories burned based on height and weight. The reason why I am mentioning this is because this will be plugged into your TDEE to a certain degree, but for the days that you aren't getting 20k steps in or want to really get into specific detail with monitoring and tracking data its good to know specifics because you might be burning far more calories than what the TDEE calculator will churn out, as even on their heavy selection (6-7x/week) its not specific to whether that's construction or olympic lifting. Tracking specifically how many calories you are burning at your worksite will give you a clear indication of how many calories are you burning per day. 

[https://www.verywellfit.com/pedometer-steps-to-calories-converter-3882595](https://www.verywellfit.com/pedometer-steps-to-calories-converter-3882595)

If you wish to lose weight but not drastically than in your particular case I think anywhere from 250-500 kcals will be more than adequate for a cut. 

To summarize:

TDEE = How many calories you are burning by functioning with keeping your activity levels in mind. Decent baseline, not extremely specific, but will get the job done.

BMR = How many calories you are burning by just existing, activity levels not included. Body composition not included either. Good baseline, not extremely specific, but it allows for individual tracking of activity levels to be added to get a better handle on what your true TDEE as opposed to a generic setting. 

If you have no desire to track how many calories you burn by working your job, just go with the TDEE calculator and subtract 250-500kcals to get on a 0.5lb-1lb/week cut. 

If you wish to track how many calories you burn by working at your job or other physical activities you engage in daily or consistently. Calculate BMR and add the daily measurement of calories burned from your smart watch/HR monitor etc to get a more specific number that you are working with. Subtract 250-500kcals to get on a 0.5-1lb/week cut. 

Hope that helps. I believe there are also private facilities available that give you a complete metabolic picture, so they tell you very specifically what your true TDEE and BMR are if you really want to get nerdy with it or want to boil it down to the T.",5,0,1,False,False,False,1646457981.0
t6wxnv,hzetbf7,t1_hzepcyn,"That's a hard question because everybody's body is different. That's why I tell people to go to a nutritionist help get things on the right track.  They'll take a measurements, and have machines to zero in on your BMI and BMR and provide a macro/cal goal per day based that data and on your level of activity, and if you have health insurance it will often pay for it for obvious reasons.   

As for how much I work out, I used to lift 3 days a week and cardio 2, but I've swapped that around.  I now lift two days a week now with my trainer (I am not looking to compete or anything.. I'm 50.. I got better things to do lol, but a trainer keeps me honest) and and hour of SERIOUS cardio M/W/F.  An hour seems like a long time, but I get into that more below. Cardio is your buddy if you want to lose weight, especially when combining both Steady State Cardio and High Intensity Interval Training not to mention it makes you feel amazing after you've been doing it for a while.  To give a little story - Arnold Schwarzenegger was at 250 when he landed the role for Conan, but it was stipulated he could be no more than I think it was 210lbs when filming started.  He did that in a few months with a lot of jogging.  Lifting is great, and additional muscle mass helps burn more energy, but not everybody (esp women I find) want to get all swol and ripped, tho I think everybody should be doing some light to moderate lifting on general principal.  Being in toned and good muscular condition makes anything physical so much easier. 

Now... Cardio for most people sucks.  I personally used to hate it. I've got ADD and there are few things more boring to me than jogging or running on a treadmill.  I did it, but grudgingly because I liked the benefits enough to keep it up... however I have a new weapon as of a couple of years ago that was a complete game changer for me... and that was an Oculus Quest VR headset.  I kid you not.  There's a whole community that has sprung up around VR fitness.  I love cardio now because it's been gamified, and that fit's in really well with me. And that hour blows by pretty quickly.  It also gives me a way better work out than just jogging etc. where you're left to your own devices usually and it's easy to slack off. I was doing 30 minute 5ks.  Pretty meh, and a far cry from my military fitness test times, but it was nigh impossible to really push myself consistently.   

I use a few different fitness apps, but one of my gotos is a boxing simulator called Thrill of the Fight and just kicks your butt.  I thought I was in good shape when I started, but three rounds in and I was bent over huffing and puffing like I had never run a mile in my life.

acids: lemon, lime, orange, wine, powdered citric acid (I think some mrs dash varieties have this) all kinds of different vinegars (apple cider vinegar is incredible on bbq.)

Tajin seasoning I don't particularly care for (too citrusy) and it does have salt in it but not a lot, is mostly chiles and citric acid.

MSG. I don't understand this one as a partial or whole replacement, I do add it to sauces, gravies, scrambled eggs, spice blends and a couple other things usually 50:50 with the normal amount of salt for the dish. And while I might not understand some people say they can cut down on salt with msg.

Spices that kick: different kinds of powdered chiles (I like cayenne and newmex together) powdered mustard, ginger powder, garlic powder (might have a kick for some but is just background for me as garlicy as we are around here)

* focus my volume on primary vanity areas
* work lower carb  (we wouldn't be doing a ton of cardio here, so we don't need a lot of carbs)

If you were 300 lbs at 5'7"" and are now 215 that is a drastic difference but you are still obese, and for alot of people that is not physically attractive. If you are expecting compliments from strangers than losing more weight and building more muscle will get you there. This notion that you lost 85 lbs deserves a pat on the back is absolute BS to me, because if you still got more to go than pal we both know that the race ain't over yet, why are you expecting medals and applause in the middle of it. I'm about to get down-voted to hell but this statement from you...

""I wonder why I did all the hard work and think I should just gain it back.""

... kinda has me all riled up, especially considering that I am that guy who gained 80 pounds in the pandemic after being in athletic shape for the large majority of life. I used to get compliments and respect and they happened when I was 10-15 pounds away from a 6-pack DL, S, BP over 400, 400, 200 lbs. That state was about a 100 pounds away from where I started with this weight-loss journey, so even before gaining the weight I was hovering in a heavier state, I have lost about 40 lbs, got 40 lbs more to go to get a functional victory, plus 20 lbs more to go for me to start getting those external validations that I frankly give a rats ass about now but since it was pertinent based on how you worded your rant. I really want to tell you that fk trying to appease others, if you ever do anything for external sources of validation rather than look from within, all this hard-work is going to be moot.

I don't know what your physique is right now, or what you used to look like but  (this is going to sting a little bit) BUT you don't get roses and cheers for getting back into the shape you were supposed to be at, sorry I know it sucks, it's not glamorous buts it the truth. It's great that you lost it but now you have literally just got back to the starting line, you should have never let yourself go to 85 lb+ (this is more for me than you) The true fitness journey starts now.

That being said congratulations on the 85 pounds lost, if this is your end-goal, bonus congratulations. If you got more to lose, than don't fking quit.

t7gg8r,hzhi3cq,t3_t7gg8r,"1) I started watching youtube videos about losing fat, intermittent fasting. And just start learning about how eating healthy affects your body. 
2) get a smart scale that links with an app and track your weight. Its nice to see the graph keep going down as you lose weight. I have the eufy smart scale which i like.

3) its tough but try to cut out or severely limit added sugars, drink black coffee, no candies, etc.

4) keep dumbells by your tv/couch and just start lifting sometimes while watching tv.

5) this is the hardest but try to eat a low carb/high protein dinner by 8pm

6) drink only water, avoid juices/sodas.

7) do it in your own pace and take it slow. Once you start seeing results, which you will if you do these. Then watching your weight go down, your clothes fitting better, better overall energy and feeling will help you stay motivated. 

8) once you do this for a while and you start seeing results. Add some more exercise, fasted walking into your routine.

9) Consistency is key!

Hope this helps!",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646508347.0
t7gg8r,hzhjp8f,t3_t7gg8r,"Maybe stick a picture of a baby to the fridge? I am on an elimination diet for allergy reasons and it is so, so much easier to just have to cut out whole categories of food due to an allergy. Maybe recast your personal idea of yourself as a person who doesn't have (whatever your worst thing is, for me it was baked goods while out of the house). I have to simply walk past the muffins because I can't eat them. 

Note that this isn't sustainable, but it can help get you started. I eat baked goods, but only at home because of the whole allergy thing, so they are much less availanle, I can't do a 400 calorie muffin for coffee break every day. My annoying everything free muffins are 90 cal each, so even if I take two to work, that's 180 cal.

I also worked slowly on reducing the calories in each meal, like I used to have to have 50g of cereal, now I can do 30, and keep my breakfast under 200. I will starve if I only have a low cal but bulky salad for lunch, but pair a salad with a couple of rye crispbreads and I feel full. It's going to be a process for you, and you're going to attack each meal and each food one at a time. 

The effects you feel in your body (or see in your bloodwork) will help maintain the enthusiasm once the intial excitement wears off.

The fact is that 'going on a diet' doesn't work.  If you are, at any time, ON a diet, the obvious implication is that there will come a day when you are OFF that diet.  And then... what?  What stops you from ending up right where you were before the diet?

If you address the REASON you got to that state in the first place, though, you can make the lifestyle changes that are necessary to adjust your nutritional approach for the long run, which will make the difference.  It's so, so sad how many people think that a short-term diet or a quick fix will be the ultimate answer, and supplement companies and influencers that push that message should be flayed and bankrupted. It's devastating how many people have failed themselves and ended up in an even worse place than when they started when they went 'on a diet' instead of addressing their mental health!

t6pejm,hzdvp5g,t3_t6pejm,"Another part of this is that a lot of people believe that losing all the weight is going to magically make everything better -- it's not. If anything, it introduces a different subset of issues (in many respects). I remember the first time I lost 80lbs, I was having a lot of issues with some of the attention I was getting (specifically unwelcome comments and touching that  amounted to sexual harassment at my workplace) and was also having issues that someone I had a crush on when I was significantly heavier was now interested in me because I had lost the weight (and were being obsessive about what I ate and wore, which aside from being a huge turn off also impacted some of my personal friendships). It was a level of mind fuckery that I had never experienced before and was ill equipped to handle.

I'm not saying it's like that for everyone, and I'm definitely not saying it's the norm, but mental health cannot be underestimated when it comes to weight loss.

t7fuc0,hzhltxd,t3_t7fuc0,"I am in a weight-management program called Take Off Pounds Sensibly.   You can think of it as a non-profit, low-cost, peer-led version of Weight Watchers.    We weigh-in every week.  

FIRSTLY -- any program that lets you phone in your weights is going to have people in it that feel pressured to give the wanted number instead of the real number.    Because of this, your counselor should not actually feel surprised (no matter how she may act when you do tell her).   

SECONDLY -- this is -your- responsibility, not your counselor or doctor or your parents.    It is a voluntary self-improvement effort that you're on.   You are 100% entitled to stop it and do something else, or set your own priorities and timeline for losing your extra weight.

But I will say this:  it seems like nobody warned you that you could have a perfect week of eating 1200 Calories and still gain weight that week.   This is perfectly normal because, unlike bodyfat mass, the amount of water we carry in our bodies varies a lot.   We can't burn water -- it comes and goes.   So to cut through that, we have to chart our weights and ignore that the line on the chart is often jagged.   

> you can lose 2-5 lbs every week

You probably could lose 2 pounds of fat a week eating 1200 from 230 lbs., but not 5.   And if someone set you up to believe that you'd lose 2-5 every week, then my advice is to fire that program.  They misrepresented what is actually possible.   

Doctors, unfortunately, are only well-trained in nutrition if they want to be.   The requisite knowledge is surprisingly bare.    Doctors with a thorough understanding of nutrition and obesity are probably specialists in that area.  

Ignore your embarrassment.  That's a feeling and it is no way to make a rational decision.    Yes, this is a -you- problem but your doctor is supposed to be your body's health expert advising you and you have not been well advised.

 -- and we have a couple of daily accountability threads.   Here's the difference, though: since we're all weight-losers here sharing our struggles, there's no reason to lie here.  We know this is hard.  We know that we often intend to behave one way but by the end of the day the opposite happens.   In some way, we all fail somehow every day yet we creep towards reaching our goals because every little positive thing we do helps us to get further along. 

DON'T DECIDE until you're calmer.  Then start completely fresh either with your doctor's program, our program, or something else.   Remember, though, that the eventual goal isn't to lose weight but to keep that weight off using your normal, everyday habits (that you need to retune) -- if you don't change your habits, your old habits will bring your old weight back.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646510011.0

But the other elements are all red flags to me.

I do tend to go more on the side of forgiveness and maybe this is her first time. But it feels her habits are likely to cause more of the same.

Keep in mind you are her client, not her friend. You are paying for a service and you should feel you are receiving a value that is worthy of that investment.

So it's worth remembering why you engaged a PT in the first place and measure your return on investment against that.

I've seen so many PTs (unfortunately it's the majority) who priorize their social calendar over their professional responsibilities. And I have to say, those who compete can be among the worst (they are doing the job because they want to compete and this is a logical avenue and their physique is a good marketing tool, but they don't have a true passion for helping others or developing their coaching skills).

My suggestion would suggest raising it (pleasantly but make it clear it's not ""nothing"" and brush it off). Make sure she credits you the session (and, ideally, offers you an extra one for free as an apology). And see if this sparks more focused attention.

If it feels her IG posts are her priority, away from sessions, you are commonly asked to reschedule sessions (for a variety of reasons) especially last minute, that your chat in sessions is just that - chat and the session plans have little structure or personalisation, then consider looking elsewhere.

It doesn't have to be awkward. Just look at alternatives, give her a few week's notice and explain you want to experiment with other approaches to see if it might benefit you.

I did a video on this recently. Ultimately inexperience is no excuse. If a PT is charging money they should be able to provide the service promoted (for the client, not just be able to train themselves).

Your time can't be bought back. And your health and fitness are hugely important.

So make sure you are not devaluing yourself in an attempt to "" be nice"" as it will only get more awkward as time goes on and you may even resent the time you wasted.

Just some thoughts to keep in mind. Not necessarily act on (yet).

Let me reiterate for you, it is YOUR hard-earned money, YOU are the client, you are literally paying her to train you, she should be the one holding you accountable not the other way around. 

My recommendation, watch a few YT videos on proper-form for the compound movements, or you can skip them straight up and just use the machines or free-weights and get into the habit of getting to the gym. I think a lot of people lose motivation to go consistently to the gym because they just overburden themselves with what they are capable of handling. Not everyone is meant to or can be at the gym for 60-120 min 5x/week. That is perfectly okay, just get into the routine of packing your gear and getting to the gym, that's it. You don't have to workout, you don't have to change. Just step inside the gym, look at the all the sweaty people, maybe even grab a drink at the fountain. At this point, mission accomplished. You are done day 1 of the program, if you want to get on a cardio machine or hit the sauna, take a deuce in the toilet. It's all cherry on top. Do that for the 1st week for M-F straight, I don't care if you want to do a routine from some influencer that has you in the gym for only M/W/F. Go the 1st, every weekday bonus brownie points for going on the weekend as well. Week 2; Repeat Week 1 but now you have to spend 5 min at the gym. You want to stand around and listen to Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana? and call it a day the second the song stops? be my guest. Anything more is cherries. Week 2 you only have to get to the gym 4 times in the week. Bonus Brownie Points if you make all 5 days, Bonus Bonus Brownie points if you do the weekends too. Week 3, spend 10 min at the gym and call it a day, now you only have to go to the gym 3 times a week. At this point you will realize if you like **Cherries**, **Brownies, Both** or you fking **Hate** *dessert*. Week 4, spend 15 min at the gym for 3x (minimum for those thinking some sweet haven was about to arrive as we progress). If by this point you are not already planning your gym trips with some type of workout than the gym is really not for you. You don't enjoy the environment, and again this is perfectly fine. Some people are more home gym types, some people like the outdoors (rock-climbing, hiking, walks in the parks etc), some people are more into MMA or Boxing or BJJ or etc, some people like salsa dancing and so on and so forth. You can apply this little trick of just showing up the venue without any expectations and figure out what works best for you. 

Wow after writing that rant, I just realized that I assumed you were a beginner and that the only reason why you need a PT is because you either don't have a habit, or feel like you don't know what to do. Both of which can be mind-blastingly wrong. I'm going to keep the rant up because gosh darn it I wrote it, and hopefully someone can learn something from it. If not the internet will keep a forever archive of my ADHD fuelled mind at 2 AM.

I'm gonna jump in and say this is a terrible goal for two reasons:

1. Any amount of time spent in this sub will show you how fickle weight loss can be, with plateaus and whooshes and bloat. It's not going to be linear and isn't wholly in your control, so it's not a SMART goal.

Your goal is to eat within your calorie budget in a way that is mentally and physically healthy. If you do that you succeed! Trust the system that the weight will come off, and if it's not working then tweak the system (change macros, weigh food more carefully, look for hidden calories).

2. There is no ""end point"" for healthy eating. Start eating healthy and start being happy now, because things don't change as much as you'd think when you hit some arbitrary goal. If you go back to eating like you used to you'll go back to looking like you used to, so find happiness in this new way of eating and moving and living and don't think or worry much about the end goal, you'll know when you're ready to stop.

The bonus is that eating well and moving more are basically the secret to being happy!",10,0,0,False,False,False,1646422967.0

For now, before your appointements if you want to make one small change I would recommend you take time to be more mindful of the moment in general and when eating. Just take 2 minutes to stop anything and just be in the present and look around. Look at your hands, take time to inspect them, look around the room and take your time and breath the air. It sounds simple but from my experience we are so much focused on doing than being. Try to do that everyday even as little as 2 minutes, just drop your phone and be there in the true present without any thoughts and just be!

I presume since it is an impulse you might eat fast, when you eat anything force yourself to take like 20 minutes to eat your meal. You cannot finish the meal under the 20 minutes. For that you can drop the ustensils, take your time to chew more, stop and look around and be present more in the moment. Do that for every meal, you have to learn to be patient when you eat. Over the long term it will help you greatly. Put that as an objective for a long term healthy habits. It is truly a game changer you can have in your cards. Take note of your meals in a journal, you dont have to track calories, but atleast note what you ate and note the time you took to eat and make sure you always follow that time. Over the long run it will be automatic.

Also for facing your anxiety I recommend that when you have anxiety, stay away from the rooms with food, stay in your room lock yourself in if necessary, pause and just sit down and face the anxiety. Just be mindful of your thought wait and let the thoughts of anxiety pass and go away. Just endure the anxiety ( I know it is quite hard, I had extreme anxiety panics) , let the thoughts pass and go away. See it all as lies. I know it will be hard, I used to have a similar problems but once I decided to sit through my anxiety that mechanism was gone forever. It was hard, I even cried and had all my family around but I made it through. Now when I have anxiety I just sit through it and let it go. My cravings and everything I did the same things, I sat on my chair just being mindful and letting the thoughts evaporate. It's really more a mental health issue than a physical health journey.",5,0,0,False,False,False,1646460642.0

3. I strongly recommend you eat at maintenance for a month or two, get used to that feeling, reset your metabolism and recharge your energy.  Use this time to also learn about compound movement resistance training (even bodyweight and basic dumbbells can get you started!).

It's a little nitpicky, but this isn't strictly true.

It is much more difficult to pack in adequate protein into a very calorie restrictive diet, and large deficits (like OP's) can also impact muscle gains, but there is no reason you can't put on muscle with a modest calorie deficit as long as you keep your macros (especially protein) solid.

t6vu4v,hze48hf,t3_t6vu4v,"I find that when I do intermittent fasting my body might want to binge, instead of trying to starve myself I give myself the best nutrients dense food aka fruits and veggies yet I still loose weight. If I am full I wont want to eat anything else. It's prevent any binge and fruits and veggies are so low calories and full of amazing nutrients that your body want and need. There is no point in fighting your body with starving when you can fill it with others kind of food that satiate you easier and make you loose weight too!!


For emotions eating I think you need to realise that food is just fuel. You need to dissasociate the pleasure in food. There should not be any. We should just see food as energy. Yes we can enjoy the taste but let keep it at it. I think that a crucial realisation to anyone trying to attain a healthy weight. The cravings vanishes

For impulsive eating I recommend you start mindful eating. Force yourself everyday to take your time when eating. Drop the fork and watch around be mindful of the situation. Over Time it will be automatic ( talking from someone who used to eat everything in 5 minutes ) start by eating like in 10 minutes or 20. When I started mindful eating I looked at my clock and I said okay I will not finish eating till it's 12:20. So I take my time to chew more and pause and look around letting my body doing it job absorbing the fuel I am giving. After a few weeks it became automatic and now I cannot finish my plates, my body tells me I am full faster. Seems like I cant binge anymore.


 I would also recommend seeing a RD that can offer you plenty of amazing recipes.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646441545.0

But when I started keeping my mind in the moment and thinking through the binge, it became obvious that it made me feel horrible. The stomach ache, constant bloating, horrible digestive system, everything. And I barely even tasted the food. I had to fix my brain by teaching it that binge eating ‚ûû bad consequences.

It was mindfulness. Which, if you told me that a couple years ago, I would think it sounds like bullshit. But it worked for me and I'm embarrassed to even type how much I used to eat in one sitting. It takes practice. The earlier you catch yourself in the binge process the better. Step back from the moment and really think about your own thoughts. Ask yourself if your next actions are going to make your life better or worse. Don't attack yourself for thinking the wrong things. Just make honest judgments about what goes through your mind.

t70mv2,hzeshqq,t3_t70mv2,"Addiction is complicated and there is more than one way of viewing it. My preferred definition of addiction is a compulsion to consume something or engage in some activity when the harm from doing so outweighs the benefits. This can be a tricky definition because people can argue about the harm and the benefit, but it covers both substance abuse and other forms of addiction like gambling addiction. And it would fit your situation, since you acknowledge that you feel compelled to overeat, but you agree that it is harming you. This is separate from dependence, which happens with substance use, where the body has become reliant on a substance and will suffer health problems during withdrawal. Dependence often goes with addiction, such as people who become physically dependent on alcohol and need medical help to safely taper off. But dependence can happen without addiction, such as cases of people with severe health problems who may become dependent on pain killers, but the benefit of the pain killers may be worthwhile given the severity of the health problems. The main difference between substance abuse and eating is that many forms of substance abuse have the added component of dependence that food addiction does not have. Although food is a particularly difficult addiction in that you cannot stop cold turkey. You have to eat. The goal is not to stop eating, but to get to a point where you eat in a healthy way. 

You probably would benefit from a therapist with experience with eating disorders. You need to determine why you use food as a coping mechanism and then get a mix of dealing with the things you are trying to cope with with food and find healthier coping mechanisms for the stress of life that just needs to be dealt with, since you can't just fix everything in your life. 

One of the things that can be particularly tough with addiction is that addicts often engage in other harmful activities that are tangentially connected to the addiction. Things like lying to people about their addiction, which then means they need help healing their social relations. And stealing or engaging in other problematic behaviors to acquire what they are addicted to. It can also involve dangerous behaviors that directly risk others, such as driving while not sober. And hopefully you do not have this extra layer of problems that can often come up with addiction, but are not always present. 

I have not used overeaters anonymous nor do I know anyone who has. But it is certainly the case that many people find extra social support helpful, and listening to other people's experiences can also be helpful. So, that might be beneficial to you if it is accessible to you. Hearing why other people felt a compulsion to overeat might help you to understand why you do. Every coping mechanism serves a purpose. It isn't always serving that purpose in a healthy way, but you have it because it's trying to accomplish something. You need to figure out what that something is and then how to deal with it in a healthier way. And perhaps there will be other people who figured that out for themselves, so it could help you when trying to think that through for yourself.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646452743.0

Go for tea/coffee and restrict yourself to healthy choices  - black tea, actual coffee. 

Board games - if there's a board game cafe in your city, to try out new games, even better. 

Museums/galleries/historical sites - this involves walking and learning, but dont generally allow food.  Your local public library may provide free passes, too!  If you find one you like, buy a yearly pass for huge savings (esp if it's a really walkable place like a zoo).

Mini golf, axe throwing, playing pool, darts, etc. - if you can avoid the snack bar and stick to sparkling water (these are all bar activities).  You could try a driving range (golf) or a batting cage (baseball), try any goofy new thing in a spirit of fun.  

If you have this in your community - try renting a kayak or canoe, paddle boat, or similar 

Plan, shop, cook and serve a healthy meal together - serve it on your best china, by candle light, so romantic. 

Walking tour - historical, architecture, haunted - learn about your community and get some steps in.  

Browse a bookstore or your library, (maybe find a new board game or cookbook) or take in an author visit or other event. If you live in university town, check its calendar of events for community lectures, films, science nights, or other fun events that aren't centred around snacks.  

Video games  - the best ones require both hands all the time, so no time to reach for snacks. 

And some great activities do revolve around food - healthy cooking class, tea tastings, or visit an urban farm, farmer's market, travel to that out of the way ethnic market, find a farmstand, pick your own berries (this is real exercise!).  Start a community garden plot and grow your own lettuce.

Try an app such as My Fitness Pal or Lose It and a food scale. Enter your starting stats, goal weight, and a reasonable rate of loss (one pound per week on average is reasonable). Go with the calorie target the app gives you. 1200 calories is pretty miserable, and may be contributing to the binges.

Try planning and tracking your food for the day the night before in whichever app you choose to use.

t6w3dk,hzdxrim,t3_t6w3dk,"Hi I have binging disorder and I‚Äôve been where you are! here‚Äôs some of my tips:

okay 1) those days will happen. Be prepared for them. Especially when you‚Äôre on your period. Its part of the process.

2) weight loss is not just about long term diets, it‚Äôs about habit change. In order to lose the weight you have to first lose the habits that made you gain in the first place.

3) You have to repair your relationship with food, and you‚Äôre not going to do this by keeping all your favourites out of the house. I get the temptation I really do, but you need to learn to live with these foods in peace. I always had a box of oreos in the house, some days I would binge and eat the whole thing and hate myself. But you know what? I kept buying another box. When you restrict yourself it‚Äôs all your brain thinks about, but if you train your mind that this food is here to stay in abundance, it makes you want it less.

4) You can still have you‚Äôre favourite foods in a diet! I would actually  argue it‚Äôs necessary, bc if you restrict too hard you‚Äôre going to eventually crack and binge. Learn to sprinkle in your fave foods here and there, while still meeting your caloric goals. Have pizza for dinner sometimes, but have 2 slices instead of the box. Personally I have a sweet tooth so I make sure I allow myself to have something sweet everyday, I have just a square of chocolate or 2 oreos. You‚Äôre learning to eat these foods in moderation, it will take time and you will have set backs. Again this is about learning new habits and finding peace with these foods.

7) Make sure you‚Äôre still satisfying yourself. You‚Äôre not going to make it by eating salads everyday. Eat foods that make you happy but still fit your goals. This morning I was dying for a grilled cheese and even though it‚Äôs not seen as the healthiest food I had one anyway! but I surrounded it with fruit and veggies and some protein for balance:)

6) Add to your life. Sometimes food is a way of filling a void that lives within us. What are you lacking in your life? Are you living as your authentic self? Do you depend on food for happiness bc you‚Äôre not happy in your life by itself? these problems must be addressed.

Yes those fitness people are freaks of nature‚Äî but are you like that? could you really live a life like that? No, you enjoy food and that‚Äôs okay, you just have to learn moderation. I remember when I first started I googled all the habits of naturally skinny people and tried to copy them, like skipping meals, or not caring about sweets, stuff like that and you know what it was never going to work bc I was trying to be someone I wasn‚Äôt! 

While you‚Äôre dieting it‚Äôs a good idea to mostly stay away from fast food, but eventually you‚Äôre gunna crave it so when you do just get a normal meal, not a binge meal. Get a small burger, a drink and some fries and have that be your dinner. Once you lose the weight you‚Äôll be able to have to more often and maybe include some icecream too, but cutting it out completely will just drive you insane and you‚Äôll eventually binge.

Honey you gotta step you‚Äôre veggie game up, steamed veggies are boring!

You need to find things other than food that make you happy. You'll know if they are making you happy if you don't feel compelled to grab a snack while doing them.

I started swapping out one thing at a time. and am about 40 lbs down from when i started. Only now starting to get some exercise in. but I hate running so I skateboard around the block (although it was easier 15 years ago)

Started with Soda, worked that down to powerade, then to flavored club soda, then non flavored, and now i just keep a water bottle. took about a year to end up with just water. but because i didnt just say, ""no soda"" one day. I worked it down in a way that didnt feel overwhelming. Not fast. but not a shock to the system.

Recently I started finding replacements for the good stuff. I like shitty fast food. I found some vegan chicken nuggets at walmart (im not vegan at ALL, but these are tasty). if it can scratch 80% of the itch, it keeps me from snacking. I still hit tbell, not all the way there yet. but now i might go once every other week instead of 3-4x a week. 

The Journey is different for everyone. if you are not the person who flips a switch and immediately commits to a new lifestyle, you are the majority. Find stuff that works for you. Swap out the garbage slowly, start making smaller promises to yourself that you know you can keep. Knowing you are good for your word is in my opinion much better for your mental health than the weight loss itself. 

and dont let a step back be the end. You failed today, big deal, get it tomorrow. can you get two days in a row? 3? maybe you buy yourself a nice Steak dinner if you do a week? If you try to be 1% better every day, you are walking in the right direction. just becomes a matter of how hard you wanna chase after it.

Maybe that's no snacking after dinner, only one night of take out a week, tracking calories for a week, or something suitable challenging for yourself.

I would say if having any room for treats leads you into binging then you're going to need to start looking inwards here because it sounds like this is more mental than physical.

Personally I increased my calories to the accepted -500 a day and work out 7 days a week and everything has been melting off like clockwork, but it took me a hot minute to get my brain right when it came to self control. Sometimes you've just got to go a little David Goggins with yourself when it comes to self discipline. You know you should be eating more or it'll lead to disaster, so you need to practice setting that limit and telling yourself ""no more"" once you've hit it. Restricting like that is going to backfire into a binge eventually 100% of the time. You said fitness is hard for you to fit in. You've got to find a way to fit exercise in for this to be sustainable long term, even if it's a 30 minute walk at lunch to start.

Think about it this way: you've been down this road and you know where it's going to take you, and you don't want that.

t6zks5,hzgl4hw,t1_hzgf475,"When I'm eating what I enjoy and not paying attention to my weight at all, I have a real sweet tooth, I eat a lot of red meat and deli meat, a lot of carbs (bread, bagels, pasta, etc.), a lot of dairy (I'm a cheese fanatic), not many vegetables, etc.  My baseline eating pattern is terrible.  I also am a reasonably heavy drinker, which of course is a separate issue but definitely makes dieting almost impossible. 

If I try to do 1500-2000 instead of 1200-1500, I still mostly cut alcohol out (which I kinda need to do anyway) and can be somewhat more successful cutting out sweets, but I end up overdoing it somewhat on carbs, red meat, etc.,  so I end up going over, because those foods are just more calorie dense so I end up going over to feel satiated.

At 1200-1500, my food mostly consists of eggs (lots.. and lots.. of eggs), oatmeal (sometimes with milk, sometimes with water, and then generally with berries for sweetness), greek yogurt with frozen berries (which is ok, but repetitive and a chore to eat), chicken breast, various vegetables (none of which I like), vegetable soup (so, so much vegetable soup... on which I spend a fortune trying to flavor with herbs etc and it remains either bland or affirmatively bad), canned tuna (which I often dump into the veg soup just to get all the bad over with), salads with the above thrown on it, very occasional chickpea pasta with sauce (this is ""indulgent""), and then stealing a scrap of actually tasty food from my wife's or kid's plate when there is something left over (and yes, I do track it when I do that).  For the most part, I feel satiated here--combination of the fact that these foods are less calorie dense and I just dislike eating them so much (over and over again, anyway--I'm ok with most of these every once in awhile) that I have no desire to eat more...

So, basically, I cut out all of the foods I actually enjoy because all of the foods I actually enjoy are pretty unhealthy, heh.  I obviously use herbs, hot sauce (in moderation, because of salt), etc., but that can't substitute for largely cutting out sweets and red meat.",1,0,0,False,False,True,1646494260.0
t6zks5,hzhcnlu,t1_hzgl4hw,"That really doesn't sound sustainable as you say - you can't be succesful long term on things you don't like. Half the stuff you eat makes you sound miserable to eat it. I'd be balls deep in a bag of doritos if I felt the way you do about my diet. It's not going to be enjoyable to hear, but you need to work on the ""inevitable"" part of your 1500-1800 attempts ending up at 2200 instead, and work on your moderation and including things you like. 

You can have a more calorie dense red meat... and bulk up the meal with a higher volume lower calorie side - consider trying out other methods/vegetables that you might like more (i.e roasting vs boiling or peppers vs courgette). _Have_ pasta and if you _like_ chicken lower the pasta amount and opt for more of your protein in there. 

It sounds stupid saying it on a weight loss sub but coming at it from restriction often can be a precursor to binging on the ""bad""/""forbidden"" foods instead. I'd really recommend taking some time to sit down and think of meals you'd really _enjoy_ eating within your calories that have the volume to not make you want to tear through the fridge. I don't eat meat but I know I like pasta - the green lentil pasta tastes the same as normal to me but is higher protein so I swap those for higher satisfaction. I like it in a tomato sauce so a mirepoix (equal parts carrot, celery, onion) adds a shitload of depth of flavour so in that goes. Cooked down, in goes some garlic. In goes the passata. I know I like paprika, that goes in too. Salt/pepper for flavour. And honestly? Usually that tastes pretty decent. Mock chicken is pretty low cal and high protein so I throw in a fuckton of that for the physical feeling of fullness. I want more cheese volume so I opt for 60g of a lean cheese to see that cheese mountain on top. From memory? That usually comes to about 450 calories and over 30g of protein. But I enjoy it. I don't feel deprived because I just had a big bowl of cheesy garlicky pasta. 

( ignore this part if food suggestions aren't wanted but re: soup, you might want to lean towards stews and try a few recipes instead. Some people are good at soup and I'm not one of them, but carrot & coconut soup tends to turn out well cause I love carrots. Tomato soup is a million times better with cheddar on top.

I then realized that I was not healthy and needed to eat because being weak and hungry constantly and always thinking about food was not a way I wanted to live. So I gained the way back and more. 
I then decided to learn a lot about nutrition and how I could reach my ideal weight in a healthy way. I found people overeat because processed foods have there fiber, nutrient and water taken out of them. And I stopped lisening to marketing and started listening to unbiased science. 
I am now come down to my ideal weight and have never felt better In my life.
I am now on a Whole Foods vegan diet, I eat high fruit and high carb as well. This truly is the diet for health. This is not however the diet for quick weight loss but for long term easily sustained results and health.

Things to avoid:

-processed foods, if it has to nutrients and fiber taken out it‚Äôs a no.

-oil, it‚Äôs a lot healthier to just eat what the oils made of with is filling, have fries with can be like 500 from oil. If you have a whole food. For example avacodo, it‚Äôs pretty hard to eat that much avacado.

-fake sugar. Controversial but it‚Äôs the truth, sugar is actual good for us especially natural sugar. We crave sugar because our bodies run on glucose. Our brains run exclusively off glucose. Our bodies are a lot smarter than we think. Fake sugar makes us happy because the body thinks we are getting what we need. But we aren‚Äôt we are just tricking our bodies. Then we crave more after realizing it wasn‚Äôt real.

-vinegar, have a healthy gut is so important for overall health and vinegar kills beneficial gut bacteria.
Things to add:

Whole foods

Foods with fibre 

Fruit- fruit, fruit is so important, foods have tons of important vitamins which people don‚Äôt get enough of, like potassium and vitamin C etc. humans actually have the same digestive systems as frugivores(animals that eat mainly fruit). We thrive off lists of fruits I eat two large meals a day with a cooked dinner, which is usually some combination of things like grains or potatoes with veggies. Fruits give people the natural sugar they are actually craving. Which is why most candy is fruit flavored

-vegetables

-carbs like brown rice or potatoes

However, understanding these process DOES make it easier to stay calm and keep going when the scale has a water blip or a few days of stellar behavior doesn't immediately result in a loss.

It also helped me to realize that ""deficit"" isn't an all-the-time thing.  That lipolysis or lipogenesis is naturally happening all day long, mode-switching as needed based on how much and how long since we have eaten and -- to some degree -- what that food was.

Journaling helps a lot. Write down how you feel after a binge and try to keep that in mind the next time you're tempted to binge. Set some new daily goals to check off a list. Here are some ideas you could put on your list:

- Drink a glass of water before each meal

- Include a serving of fruit/veg with each meal

- Try to make every meal last 15 minutes (by chewing slowly and taking pauses between bites)

- Stop eating as soon as you no longer feel hungry, challenge yourself to wrap up your leftovers and put them in the fridge for later

- Go for a walk right after you're done dinner

Work on your inner monologue while you eat to be more mindful. Ask yourself if you're still enjoying your food, if you're approaching satiety, and how you think you will feel an hour after you're done eating. Ask yourself if you're eating because you're hungry or because you're self-soothing. And if you're self-soothing, what's a healthier alternative you could try?

Aside from dietary habits - try to improve your sleep schedule and stress management as well. Try to get 8 hours of high-quality sleep every night.

Generally its best to sticking to non-processed food, limit your sugar and make sure you‚Äôre getting a source of carbs, fat and protein in each meal (protein is especially good for keeping you full and building muscle). 

Just going for regular walks at first can help you feel more comfortable moving, and all I can say is the worrying and anxiety about exercising is usually worse than the exercise itself. 

Final tip is make it as easy as possible to stick to. Don‚Äôt commit to a gym session when you know your schedule is already bursting that day.

If you put more effort into eating fruit, it probably isn't too bad, but between fruits and vegetables most vegetables are probably better for you than most fruits.

Or fresh bell pepper versus roasted versus boiled. And all of that is different from squash, which while technically a fruit fits well into the general dietary area of fruits and veggies and isn't as sugary as many other fruits.

t7174r,hzf0vwx,t3_t7174r,"How do you prepare them? Boiling and steaming I find boring and makes veggies mushy and gross because it‚Äôs basically cooking the vegetable in moisture and doesn‚Äôt add flavor. Try roasting or saut√©ing vegetables instead if you haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a way better experience. Broccoli boiled or steamed makes me want to vomit, broccoli roasted in the oven with some spices is enjoyable. Roasting veggies makes them crispy and less mushy in my experience! Best recommendation is to just google ‚Äúroasted *insert veggie name here* recipe‚Äù and then pick one with the best ratings. Sooo many recipes on google that have been reviewed by hundreds of people. That‚Äôs how I find the best recipes! It‚Äôs usually just ‚Äúput these spices on raw veggies and cook at 375 for x minutes‚Äù pretty simple stuff. 

A medley roast is even better as it gets you a variety of veggies in one sheet pan. Eg a root veggie roast with carrots, potatoes, beets, etc. more color variety = more nutrient variety. If you can make your dish a rainbow you‚Äôre doing good! If you have access to or want to get an air fryer, it makes everything so crisp. I use mine more than my oven and there‚Äôs so many good recipes online. 

Also you can try blending pretty much any basic vegetable soup. An immersion blender may not be a bad investment for you, they can be fairly cheap, work well, and you just blend the soup right in the pot when it‚Äôs done cooking. 

I also find that broccoli and spinach are flavorless raw, so you can put them in a smoothie with fruit if you feel like you need more greens in your diet and you won‚Äôt notice a difference in taste. You can also make a veggie smoothie (like homemade v8 juice) with a bunch of veggies like carrots, green leafy veggies, etc.

Part of the ""back on track"" problem is that we are trying to get back on our former track.   Before all this crap happened, things had a certain momentum and had become routines in our lives.   Those things got interrupted.   

We have to rebuild this from zero, but not zero knowledge.  We have to log our food and deal with our wanting inner child without letting it feel deprived and all of those other things.  

> I know the problem is snack and sweets and binge eating.

Maybe that's what is happening, but that's not the problem.  The problem is the lack of positive things.  

When we train children, athletes, musicians, animals, soldiers -- we train by practicing **the desired behavior** over and over.   The only thing we say about the wrong behavior is, ""that wasn't it, try again.""  If repeatedly we don't get success, then we try to break it down further until we figure out success **but the focus is on success, and then repeating those successes.**

I've started taking a collagen peptide supplement for the past 6 months, seems to be helping increase the elasticity of my skin.  Of course, I don't have a clone of myself to use as an experimental control sample to see what my results would be without the supplement.

The other thing I started was wearing compression boxer shorts and compression t-shirts in lieu of regular cotton undies.  You can pick up a couple multi-packs of UA knock-off compression shorts/shirts on Amazon.  The theory is the compression helps support/compress the fat pouch to keep gravity from further stretching the skin.  Your skin is less likely to contract if it is still being stretched.

I'm also investigating plastic surgery to trim the loose skin, targeting surgery Nov 2022.  Don't let fear of cost and judgement prevent you from at least investigating.

t607dv,hzbq64p,t3_t607dv,"May I give you a different outlook on your situation since I‚Äòve successfully overcome my BED that I have been battling for over 10 years?


Everyone of us has this ‚Äûmonster‚Äú inside of us. It comes to the surface everytime we had a bad day, argued with a loved one, something didn‚Äòt go as planned, we‚Äòre disappointed with ourselves etc. - any type of unwanted/negative emotion, really. 


As children, we have been taught (or not) to appease this monster. Each of us developed their own coping mechanisms for these situations, one can be eating. We are quite literally feeding this monster, drowning the emotions in food. We can all agree that that‚Äòs not a good coping mechanism. This monster, though, still wants to be appeased. So what can you do to live with this monster? Because, trust me, ignoring and supressing it doesn‚Äòt make it go away. It will just become larger and larger, lingering under the surface, waiting for a crack in the surface to come out with full vengeance.


Next time you meet with your monster, take your time to listen to it. What is it that brought it to the surface? What do you feel right at that moment? What does your monster really want? How can you make your monster happy?


There might be different scenarios that require different coping mechanisms. Take your time to find a strategy for each of these situations! You don‚Äòt have to take them on all at once.
I want to give you a few examples of what I did and which strategies I chose:
(1) being mentally exhausted after work >> going for a walk in the woods, taking my time to listen to the wind and birds and taking deep breaths
(2) feeling taken advantage of at work >> saying no; ultimately searching for new job
(3) feeling lonely >> calling a loved one and just talk about their day; going to see a movie alone; doing something nice for myself like a bubblebath or buying a new book to read
(4) resentment over family drama from my childhood >> going to a secluded spot to scream until my voice broke; having a good cry at home; forgiving my parents for not being perfect and letting all that resentment go

What helped me the most was to remember that the goal weight is not the end of a race, but merely a turn into a longer leg of the race:  keeping off the weight.   All of the same skills are in that next leg -- tracking food, monitoring my weight, minding my portions, handling my stress or boredom more productively, and so on.    

Not only must we not give up on the keystone habits that will take off this weight, we must incorporate and normalize them into our life so that they become mindless, automatic habit.   Think about it:  if you can make tracking food as natural as any other several-times-a-day habit, it won't bother you at all to do it. 

Another thing that helped me is to recognize this discouragement and this desire to stop logging as something from the emotional realm instead of something from the physical realm.  We are not physically blocked from tracking our food.  Nothing bad is actually happening other than our desires to be at a number that we picked by a date that we picked is not happening according to the schedule that we think it should.   So what helps here is the advice ""Amor Fati"" -- love fate.  

We absolutely should plan.   It's okay to have preferences.  Where we sometimes go wrong is to promote those preferences and plans into future history, as if something is wrong if it doesn't unfold that way.   

We do need to be working at something, but we have to remember that we're not the authors of the future, fate is.  Our free will only goes so far, and it gives us a lot of flexibility, but fate is ultimately in charge and our lives will be more satisfying if we didn't turn our preferences and plans into hard-core must-happen laws.  

""Take it easy"" and ""be cool"" and such are the way to feel about the things that just happen.  All we can do is to make the right choices and try to do right willful actions.  The rest is up to fate.

And finally:  

> I want my 24th bday gift to self = good labwork (particularly focusing on A1c). 

That's also something fine to prefer, but what happens if it is worse than before, the same as before, or not as good as you hope?

I would call this your ""vision"" -- this is what you prefer to happen.  However, all you can control is your own actions and choices.  So your gift to yourself is in what you do.  On the day you take that blood test, you should be able to look over the past few weeks and months and give yourself a recap:  ""All in all, I did the best that I could humanly do given my circumstances.""   Even before you get the test results, you should do this recap.   The results themselves shouldn't matter -- the gift was in the good effort and wise choices.

I decided to lose weight from my highest because I started rock climbing and fell in love with it so I wanted to get in shape for it. I even quit smoking my 5 cigarettes a day for climbing. 

If you don‚Äôt already have an active hobby you love for the sake of doing it and not for the sake of losing weight, you‚Äôll do it forever and it may motivate you to get and stay in shape. Climbing had taught me how to truly take care of myself to my fullest (aspiring) degree. Sleep, protein consumption, balancing fuel food and treat food for my best performance and happiness, and finding movement that I love are all important in that order. Get familiar with a personal hierarchy of needs for yourself like I laid out for myself above. This will ensure that when you‚Äôre overwhelmed, you can dial it back to the next level down and focus on that until you can go back to pushing yourself. 

Regarding picking a goal weight, don‚Äôt. This only sets you up for disappointment whether you hit it or don‚Äôt. You won‚Äôt look how you expect to when you hit it, or you may never hit it (i.e. myself reaching 140 lb - let it go). 

Make performance-based goals to hit. Lift X amount of weight. Get to X color martial arts belt. Run X miles/km in an event or on your own. Hike a mountain X tall. For me, climb grade X outdoors. 

I hope this helps, good luck!",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646409271.0

Forgive me for being a bit nosey, but my understanding is that you're already in a healthy weight range for your height, but you're trying to get down to the lower end? It also seems like you struggle with body image. 

The harsh reality is, getting down to a certain number on the scale is not a cure for body image issues, so maybe you need to shift your focus to being healthy rather than being thin.

Also lifting more might help or being consistent in whatever you‚Äôre doing will do wonders. I hope this helps! Good luck and be kind to yourself!,0,0,0,False,False,False,1646425293.0

Portion control is also important - actually read what a serving is, on a package, and measure them out.  

Consider your high calorie foods and what you can replace them with.  For me it's sparkling water instead of coke and popcorn instead of potato chips.  Baked yams (in the microwave) instead of baked potatoes.  

Consider adding vegetables to replace some of the less healthy things - I add broccoli and peas to macaroni and cheese, have a salad with dinner, cut veggies with lunch, put lettuce and sprouts on sandwiches etc.

I've felt exactly this.  What I did instead sucked for a while but now it's just normal:  I weigh every day.  I embraced the suck *because* I needed to get over those weigh-in shocks of glee or disappointment.  

Our bodies are not mostly composed of fat.  Our bodies are ~60% water (give or take several percent) by mass, and the amount changes from hour to hour, and day to day. The exact amount varies according to the rhythm of your digestive system, your food and beverage intake, sodium levels, hormones, activity, strains, etc..  [A diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Bnzgors.png) ^\[[source](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html)\] shows what a typical body at maintenance weight takes in and expels per day, most of it is water! **So, most of the weight changes we see on any given weigh-in are water changes, not fat changes.** 

Water weight is one reason we should weigh consistently: first thing in the morning, after using the toilet, but before dressing or eating/drinking. When you drink a glass of water your weight instantly goes up by 1/2 pound! However, even when being consistent, there will still be a lot of variation from day to day, so it's important not to get discouraged by that. 

Use a weight-smoothing app called [Libra \(for Android\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra&hl=en) or [Happy Scale \(for iPhone\)](https://happyscale.com/).   

One of these apps will help you see the trends more clearly with less of the volatile data noise of water.  A temporary [spike](https://i.imgur.com/LIxSC8w.jpg) won't disturb the trend and, when you get used to this, will be both less disturbing and more accurate to what's actually happening with your fat-loss effort.

As you have already seen, you can behave perfectly and get a gain or not lose weight (this happened this morning with me).

I think moving more and trying to eat less in a vague sort of way is much more effective for people 40-50 pounds heavier than you currently are. 

It‚Äôs boring standard advice but calculating your TDEE, subtracting 500 calories and making that your daily goal. Buy a food scale to help with accurate calorie counting and download a food app for logging. Try this for 4-6 weeks and see what the scale says. I find it helpful to think of weightloss as a fluid journey, you try things out to see what works for you and its not a linear success story that happens in a straight line for most people. You stumble a bit, you learn more, you get better.

 The fact that you have acknowledged that you gained weight, stepped on the scale and decided to make changes is a win in and of itself. You‚Äôre a tall woman who gained 35ish pounds in two years. Most people (myself included) bury their heads in the sand until they‚Äôre 60,70,80+ pounds overweight. Drawing that line in the sand and saying, ‚Äònope that‚Äôs enough‚Äô at a bmi of 25.4, making active choices to stop gaining any further weight (which you have successfully done for 2 months) is a big achievement.

t5sgog,hz82jx3,t3_t5sgog,"Your post resonates with me so much. 

In February 2020 I was at a great, healthy weight (after a good while of taking care of what I ate and better care of myself, too) and during the first year of the pandemic I gained, unsurprisingly, 10kg. It was normal, after halting any and all activities and eating in a disorganized manner. In the first half of 2021 I kept gaining, 7kg or so more. During this time I was going to the gym, eating healthily (or so I thought), but my weight did not budge. So at the end of September I weighed 17kg more than my comfortable weight. 

In October 2021 I joined a slimming program, started getting my meals delivered from this cafe that covers lunch and dinner, amounting to 1000 kcal. I would take care of breakfast. Since October I have been going to the gym, working with a personal trainer, no less, eating well and I have steadily gained another 8kg since then. 

All I could think of was that I can't do this anymore, as obviously nothing is working, but I said enough was enough after getting my bloodwork results mid February: cholesterol through the roof, high insulin resistance, huge vitamin D deficiency. Mind you, I've just turned 34 and this is the worst health I've had in my entire life. I had a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that, clinically, I am classified as ""obese"". 

The same blood work from May last year was impeccable, so I gathered all of the relevant info I could (blood work, gym stats evaluation, any other tests I could think of) and I contacted a nutritionist. She is actually the one designing the meals I had been eating since October, which are, however, designed for the general, healthy population - which I am not. We discussed for a long time and based on my results, restrictions (lactose & gluten because fuck me) and food preferences (!!!) she has come up with a plan. The meals I'm getting now are tailored specifically for my needs, I'm eating 1500 kcal/day, which I find rather easy to manage, and the food is absolutely delicious. Of course there was the option for me to cook these meals, but I really don't have time and I want to minimize the risk of me going off track. Tomorrow I have my first weekly evaluation to see how it's going (I've been really disciplined with my eating this week) and if we need to adapt or keep going as is. 

I know this is a wall of text but as other users said before me, there is hope. It's no shame to ask for help - if anything, I really wish I had done it sooner. For the first time in a very long while I'm feeling confident that this will actually work, I'm not feeling deprived (of course I had to give up snacking 8h/day - remember how I said I thought I was eating healthy? Yeah, no, I wasn't), and I'm actually looking forward to the evaluation tomorrow. 

For me to get to a healthy, comfortable weight, I now need to lose 20-25kg. For once I am not in a hurry and I know it will happen as long as I follow the plan, have patience, and try to mend my mental health as well. I have a task to redo the blood work in 3 months and the goal is for me to be as close to normal values as possible.

t5sgog,hz8xvw6,t3_t5sgog,"From what I have learned is that the body reacts to certain things because of the actions that you have taken to lose weight. When the body is starved of food for such a long period of time the second the body starts to get nutrients and more food than usual it has entered the body into starvation mode. Essentially it will hold onto those calroies and proteins and store them because it has been deprived of those essentials for a long time. I know the opposite side because I was a binge eater and morbidly obese. The body is different for everyone obviously but, from what I'm hearing is that you need some professional wisdom when it comes to these things at this point.

> My whole life I've been obese, reaching 242 at 22. I started a diet on my own without a doctore and lost 100 pounds in 3 years by undereating. 

I‚Äôve done my fair share of yo-yo dieting as well. Only it went well into my late thirties before I finally got a decent handle on it. 

> Last year around April I was around 150 lbs and then I continued to restrict eating lunch only, walking til I couldn't feel my legs and dining with popsicles. 

Yup. Been there too. At one point it got so bad I was eating two sandwiches a day (or less) with no cheese or mayo or anything. My entire day of eating consisted of 4 slices of white bread, a few slices of turkey, and a couple cups of raw baby carrots. I was working out for several hours a day on that. I would walk 3 miles to the gym after work, workout like a madman for 2 hours, and then hike back. 

> I kept doing it until November 2021,at this point my weight was 138 but everybody thought I was super underweight because I looked at least 40 pounds skinnier than what I was. I was always cold, looked pale as a dead 

My face got sunken in, my skin got really dry and I got sunburnt easily. My eyes were so sensitive to light I had to wear sunglasses to work on a computer. 

> and all of a sudden around the holidays I became so ravenous that I couldn't even control myself. My hunger was through the roof and I ended up gaining 15 pounds. 

The first time I broke and lost control of eating I put on 30 lbs, looking back it was probably mostly just water weight. Then I lost 15 or so and then put on 80. I developed depression and dropped out of school. Over a decade of going up and down I ended up north of 350 lbs at times. 

> I continued to undereat after the holidays and quickly got back to 145 but then my hunger got worse again, I binged and kept gaining til I reached 160. 

And there‚Äôs the magic word ‚ÄúBinged.‚Äù Here‚Äôs where I tell you what you already know. You have to go get help. I know it‚Äôs embarrassing. I know you have a stronger will than anyone you know. I know you‚Äôre smart enough to be able to see what‚Äôs happening and you just know you can handle it yourself if you can just hold it together one more time. And I told you all of that other shit about myself above so you believe me when I tell you I know it can get better but you have to deal with it mentally first. That has to get sorted first. And it‚Äôll take honesty and work and time. 

Please if you have a friend or family member just tell them you need help and would appreciate it if they would make sure you get it. You don‚Äôt even have to tell them exactly what it is. Just ask them to make sure you get to a doctor. 

> I've been eating 1200 calories of real food, mainly proteins for a week but my weight keeps going up. I went from having skinny tooth pick legs (before Xmas) to big fat thighs again.

> It's frustrating because I'm afraid I've damaged my body

I know exactly what you‚Äôre taking about. I used to lie awake at night trying to listen to my own heartbeat wondering if I‚Äôve damaged myself with the constant weight fluctuations. I got lucky. It seems no permanent damage. My blood pressure is a bit on the high side and my skin isn‚Äôt spectacular but otherwise okay. You won‚Äôt know until you go to a doctor and get checked out though. So I‚Äôll recommend that. 

> so much and basically all the weight I lost was never real, it was just the result of starving. 

It was real. It was fleeting and unhealthy, but real. You proved you have the desire to lose the weight and the will to go to extremes to do it. Now the question is do you poses the will to force yourself to do it correctly? Sure, you have the will to starve yourself but do you have the will to schedule a doctors appointment and be brutally honest about everything with them? Do you have the will to see a dietician (not a nutritionist) and follow your eating plan exactly as written even if you think ‚Äúif I skip this meal I‚Äôll hit my goal faster?‚Äù Do you have the will to show up to therapy every month to gain skills in positive self image, impulse control, breaking obsessive thoughts and shame spirals? Do you have the will to share your struggles with someone who can help you even on days where you don‚Äôt really have it in you to do those things yourself? That would make it real. 

> Right now I'm gaining on 1200 calories and the urge to restrict is always there because I'm scared I'll go back to my previous weight even by eating so little. 

Yup. Please share that concern with your heath team as well. 

> I'm bloated and constipated ever since I started to eat healthily, I'm visibly bigger (people can confirm, it's not body dismorphia) and I don't understand what's going on. 

After you go on a starvation diet your body gets used to eating very little. In my case my body got used to eating very limited types of things as well. Once you get back to eating normal foods in normal quantities it can take your digestive system time to recoup. Stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, headaches. I had it all. 

In extreme circumstances it can develop into refeeding syndrome. Which is just a ten dollar word for a bunch of random problems that can happen when you come off of an extreme fasted state. Not to be dramatic but some of them can be fatal in extreme circumstances. If you‚Äôre concerned I would suggest going to your general practitioner, tell them what you‚Äôve been up to in as much detail as they need. Worst case scenario they‚Äôll check for nutrient and mineral deficiencies, suggest vitamins if needed, tell you to monitor your salt and water intake, and refer you to a registered dietician to help you build a sustainable healthy meal plan. Which is what you should be doing anyway. 

All that is said with the caveat that I‚Äôm not a doctor. I don‚Äôt know what you need. Just that you should see one, explain the situation and get a proper examination. 

> I hope someone can write some comforting words or maybe tell me what's going on. I can't look at myself in the mirror without crying.

t5sgog,hz9btpk,t3_t5sgog,"Being visibly bigger is a matter of perception, I would focus on the numbers, such as weight, muscle mass, bone mass, water weight, etc. if I have a range I want to stay in. For something more subjective I'd focus on sleep quality and how well I can perform normal activities without running out of breath or getting too tired.

Even if others around you agree that you're visibly bigger, it's still a matter of perception. It's possible for others around us to have a distorted perception of size which can be damaging if we expect them to be more objective. I have looked bigger even at my lightest weight because of my bone structure, which makes my torso look bulky. I always look bigger in photographs no matter my weight. People around me have differing perceptions of my body (too thin, too fat, I've heard it all). It's not always a reliable measure of progress.

Please-please, don't beat up yourself up. It will only demotivate and depress you and stop your progress. Stress will make you snap and binge. A weight scale is just a weight scale, it shouldn't give u big fright. If it is, then therapy sessions will really benefit you. Sounds like an ED.
You seem to had starved and ‚Äúscared‚Äù your body. Now since it was in stress mode for a time, it will try to save any excess nutrient you get in. That's a natural effect. 
Also, there is a possibility that you will gain some extra fat afterward. But it's okay, the ‚Äúyo-yo‚Äù effect is a natural process, happens all the time after all those popular diets. That's the price for fast weight loss. Only healthy diet that meet you body needs and some moderate exercises (walking in ur case) will stop it. To find out how much your body needs, you can use any Basal metabolic rate calculator. https://youtu.be/KhhU_Ch65YQ Like here.

t5sgog,hz9k0qm,t3_t5sgog,"Hey, just so you know, you're totally worthy of love and self esteem regardless of your weight.

My advice would be to find a comfortable calorie limit and eat filling, low-cal foods to combat the hunger to your comfort. A few carrots or a stalk of celery with a couple big glasses of water can stave off fatigue and hunger between meals and a big side of cauliflower (fuck it, cook it in oil with the spices you like, just measure the oil) can make a depressing chicken breast into a meal that feels truly filling.

Ive also had huge success eating just prepackaged salads from Kroger and I think they're pretty good (and relatively cheap, here in Portland it's 3 for 10 bucks, so just over 3 bucks a meal). You could also just keep the salad ingredients you like in your fridge prepped and ready to cut down on the cost some.

Finally. It's fucking hard. We all know it's fucking hard and you're truly incredible for taking these difficult steps to be healthy. The vast majority of people never find the will power. Your metabolism may be screwy but your mind is strong as hell and it's possible to live in a body you like and be healthy and be comfortable all at the same time.

Double finally, just because you look heavier doesn't mean you look bad. Body dysmorphophobia is a very strong psychic phenomenon and it can take time and work (therapy if it's accessible to you) to really see yourself in a positive light.

You have probably messed up your metabolism. I would suggest (along with therapy), to eat at 1200 for a few weeks, and then every couple of weeks increase it by 50 calories until you get up to about 2000. This will help get your metabolism back around where it should be. You might gain some weight, but it will be minimal. Your body will slowly adapt to the extra 50 calories a day and start using it as energy. Once your metabolism is back on track, you can cut back to 1500 calories (that‚Äôs the least I would suggest doing). This will get you 1lbs of weight loss per week on average. On top of that, every couple of weeks, go back to eating at your new maintenance of 2000 calories so your body doesn‚Äôt adapt to the 1500 calories. This is a slower way of losing weight, but it helps ensure you don‚Äôt gain it all back as soon as you reach your goal. It also helps keep a healthy relationship with food. 

I like to think of it this way: would I rather lose all the weight quickly but then gain it all back and then some, or lose it slowly but never gain it back?

Edit: another thing to be aware of is your cycle. When you are close to your period, your body holds on to water a lot more so it makes it seem like you are not losing weight when you really are.

Gradually adding calories back to your diet is called a ‚Äúreverse diet.‚Äù The basic premise is that if you slowly add calories back to what your maintenance calories should be (using calculations of your TDEE) by 50-150 calories a week, it is gradual enough to allow your body to use the calories without storing them as fat. This is because (in theory) jumping up from a large deficit in calories to your maintenance, your body doesn‚Äôt know what to do with the calories since it isn‚Äôt used to having that much supply. So, the gradual add prevents the body from overreacting, basically. 
I will throw out there that the reverse diet is considered controversial. I will also say that I have successfully reverse dieted by adding 100 calories to my diet a week over several weeks. When I did it, I did gain a few pounds (by that I mean like 5), but after that, I didn‚Äôt gain any more and I was eating 1850 calories, working out 5x a week.

t67tre,hz9khgd,t3_t67tre,"Well it's only March 03. So that's 8 weeks total. 

Most workout gurus say it takes about 12 weeks to see any real difference, and it's slow. You kind of have to shave the extra fluff off to see definition appear, and working out basically does sweet f-all to help loose weight especially for women. 

It sounds like you're in a phase many of us go through ""I'm eating all the right things!"" but...you're not counting calories at all. Even if you're eating 100% healthy, you can still be eating at maintenance. Which is depressingly low for most women, like 1500 a day. 

I would consider dialing back the workouts, which are likely just making you hungry, to about 1/2 that and put the focus on the food part. 

 two hard boiled eggs and oatmeal with fruit along with a protein shake. This keeps me full until dinner time and I make chicken, or I have roasted vegetables and lately I‚Äôve really been into salads or a homemade chipotle bowl with whole grain rice. If I feel like snacking I have nuts, beef jerky, skinny popcorn, yogurt, or I have chopped raw vegetables in my fridge ready to go. I eat pretty well.

Going off my very rough estimates: 

eggs: 70 each. that's 140. 

Oatmeal, let's say 1/2 cup with milk: 150 

Fruit: depending on how much, up to 100 

Protein shake: those things are deadly, usually 300 calories 

so you're at 700 for **breakfast alone**. 

Nuts are incredibly caloric, 1/4 cup of cashews is like 100 calories. 

Yoghurt is usually 100+ calories per container

I don't know what all is in the grain bowl, but: 

Rice: 200 calories a cup. 

Cheese: 100 calories an oz. and 1 oz is nothing. It's 1/4 cup usually. 

Beans: **670 calories a cup**

So you get the picture here. Sauces and salad dressings are also HUGE calorie hiders. 2 tablespoons of my fave dressing: 140 calories. AUGH.

Also that sounds like a pretty large breakfast to me. I currently eat one egg scrambled, 1 oz or less of cheese, and either one English muffin or one slice of toast---made into a breakfast sandwich, and coffee with 2 tbs of creamer. That's **it** for my breakfast. Now I do eat lunch and occasionally a 3 PM snack if I'm peckish but lunch is similar. For dinner tonight I had half a frozen ""veggie based burrito bowl"" with a tortilla, and 4 graham crackers. That's it. It's depressing how little food I have to eat to lose weight!

I have PCOS, though weight gain was not one of my symptoms.

OP, are you taking any insulin sensitizers like metformin? That can definitely help some people. Have you switched out any higher glycemic carbs that you are eating for lower? That was a huge help to me back when I was highly symptomatic.

And truly be sure your intake is 100% accurate - every bite, sip, taste. That‚Äôs where 99% of people go wrong.  All added oils, sauces, etc. For like 20 bucks a food scale is MUCH better than measuring cups/spoons which inaccurate because too subjective (different ways to pack/fill them).

Juggling different meds always has downsides. If I were you, and wanted to avoid meds for PCOS, then I'd suggest for the long term lifestyle change, learn how to test your own blood sugar regularly and start eating exactly like a diabetic would. Functionally, PCOS is an endocrine disorder and it already puts us at higher risk of diabetes, so it makes sense to start living the diabetic lifestyle. That's how I approached it and it has been well-controlled for more than 20 years at this point.

I'm currently dealing with the fact that I can now eat 4000 calories. No eating disorder involved in my case, just that I trained for a marathon and *had to* be able to eat 3000-3500 on some days, so the ""hard stop"" my body used to give me around 2800 or so, even if I was eating hyperpalatable food, has now been moved up to the 4000-5000 range. I'm still satisfied on an appropriate amount, but I can no longer just stop keeping track on a holiday or similar with the assurance that ""just one day can't do that much damage.""

My point is maybe you just have to remain aware of portions.

The focus is largely on giving yourself permission to eat.

That‚Äôs probably my best tip.

Give yourself permission to eat. Tell your cells, every day, that food is abundant. Never tell yourself the diet starts again tomorrow. 

I also found the guided journaling aspect of the course to be very helpful. Took about two years for everything I learned about myself to really start to click, but my bingeing frequency was immediately reduced. And I felt so much more compassion for myself. 

I also had a revelation this past year, that on my ‚Äúhungry days,‚Äù such as right before my period, literally no amount of food will leave me satiated. So I stopped saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù and framed it as insatiable. I know those days are going to come. It‚Äôs okay if I want to eat more than unusual. But eating to satiety is off the table. It‚Äôs just not gonna happen.

t5ldx1,hz6j5lh,t1_hz5ndg2,"As a therapist, I can tell you the reason for this is because you need to fix your relationship with food before you attempt to lose weight. If you continue to attempt to lose weight before you've done the work, you might never be able to stop binge eating because you'll be triggered. That's why they say you need to let go of it. 

It's also a relationship with your body, that mindshift of wanting to lose weight because you hate and judge your body, to doing so because you love your body and want to take care of it. You need to give yourself time to shift between those and almost impossible to do while you're losing weight. It took me probably five years after my eating disorder before I actually attempted to lose weight in a healthy way. I'm not saying it will take that long for you, but that's the reasoning.

You have to fix your mindset and identify the root causes of your binge eating disorder, before you attempt to lose weight. They're not saying you can never lose weight, they're just saying not right now. It's about learning to love your body the way it is right now, so you can take care of it correctly in the future. They're not saying you're going to be overweight forever, but you have to let go of the irrational fear of being fat (some fear of being fat is probably healthy, but not to the point where it interferes with your life), which is very, very hard to do while dieting. 

But I'd also encourage you to flat out tell your therapist that. I guarantee it's nothing your therapist hasn't heard before and they will work with you.

I like 1800-2000 for a teen with a normal weight.  Focus on hardening your muscles **and keeping your weight the same or only gradually less.**   No fast weight loss for you, not only do you not need it, you do need the nutrients from your food -- including proteins. 

>  Should I stop consuming Bread and Sugar entirely?

No, but sugary 'treats' are treats, not really nutritious food, so they should be not be part of your daily diet but should be part of how humans celebrate with food.  It's okay to have a small treat on a special occasion.  It's less appropriate to have a large, daily sugary treat as if it was good for us -- our daily food should be a healthy and well-rounded diet.   Sugary treats are not good for us, but it's also not bad.  It's vacant -- we call them ""empty calories.""   They're not poison calories, but they're not nutritious calories.   So keep it smaller, rarer, and appropriate to an occasion.  

> What dietary and exercise tips can you give after seeing my body pics and how long do you estimate it would take before I start seeing improvements?

Ah, the ""how long"" question.  Forever.  You'll never be that picture, but you can get closer to it and, once there, you will need to continue working to stay there.  So the ""how long"" answer is forever.   This is a forever endeavor and it's one of those things where it's not the destination that is great, it's the journey that is great.  

Drop the cheat meal.  Just have some favorite every Friday and make it part of your plan.   If it's part of your plan, it's not a cheat and that's better because there is no cheating.   No matter whether you call it a ""cheat"" or not, your waistline knows that you ate that.   So let's just be easier on ourselves and not be so strict that we have to cheat -- let's just do better and better over time.  

>  I have pretty terrible self control.

Think of this in reverse:  I am improving on self-control.   When you express it as a deficiency, you are its victim falling down in front of it.

first instead of having a 1300kcal goal, im giving myself a loose ""up to"" 1600 goal but mostly making sure i stay under 1800 at least (1600 is a 500 deficit for me, 1800 is a 300 defict) 

second, instead of weighing every day like i like to, im going to put my scale away until the end of march, im far too sick of not seeing the numbers go down, so im weighing in today and then ill weigh in next time on the 1st of april

third, im not setting myself a weight based goal this month, normally i set an easily obtainable goal cause its another thing i get to tick off without too much effort, except i didnt make it in february for whatever reason, so im ditching it, and replacing it with a goal to exercice 3 times a week 

overall im super frustrated with my weight atm, im set out to lose between 2.4 and 3.4kg a month, i always get there, and my written goal is 2kg a month so i always at least get that. in january i lost 3kg, in feb i lost like 1.5kg at the most, ive gone through and compared all my logs and shit and cant find reason for it, im also in the midst of fucking pcos and cushings tests and monthly dental treatments, and trying to get the fucking autism centre to answer me before my brain leeks out of my skull so im going light af this month to see what happens. mostly im just really frustrated that i cant figure out why i stalled for a couple of weeks randomly, and now im losing way way slower than i previously was, and im not used to it happening so its not computing in my brain at all.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646401726.0

t5xdql,hz7sg86,t3_t5xdql,"Hey everyone - Hope you all are having a decent week

Self identity and self image are toughies for me. I have been overweight my whole life. It is really hard for me to envision myself as healthy, as I've never been that way. I got down to probably 160-170 lbs in my teens but it was with an eating disorder, so, not great.  

I think feeling smaller might feel vulnerable. Being fat is a great way for people to completely ignore your presence, while at the same time, you feel so huge that you cannot blend in. A weird combination.  

So I'm not sure how I will feel when the day comes that I feel normal (avg weight) either about myself or those around me. I cant look myself in the mirror and haven't for years, unless absolutely necessary. I hope that I can get over that and face myself 'as I am' and not who I wish I was (younger, smaller, prettier).

As for the week, I think I did pretty well overall. 4 lbs down.   I had 2 days where I ate a little bit more calories than the 1500 I wanted, but no binging. I'm down to 419 which is actually the lowest weight I have recorded since 2016. I'm down 39 lbs total -- Next week I hope to be able to change my flair to 40 lbs lost! So that feels great. I can't see any difference looking at myself in the mirror, but my clothes do feel a little looser. 

2 weeks ago I measured myself and today I did new measurements. I thought this would be good since the mirror can be deceiving when you have \*so much\* weight to lose. I lost 9 inches in the past 2 weeks,  6 of those coming from hips and waist. I am glad I started measuring because it shows progress and change in my body even when I can't see it visually. 

Far as anxiety and depression go, I'm now almost a month on anxiety meds and they kind of help, but they do make me feel a little out of it. Soon I will have my follow up and ask for anti depressants, hopefully some that don't make losing weight harder. I'm still struggling but hanging in there. Holding out hope that someday I will feel safe, loved and to love someone. Right now life seems like I just fucked it all up and there isn't a way to fix it. Maybe there isn't a way to fix it, but just moving forward.

t5xdql,hzarbko,t3_t5xdql,"I know I am a little late, but this is such an important topic. 

I think the body dysmorphia that comes after an 100 pound weight loss is truly no small thing. I have been thinking about if it‚Äôs maybe time to see someone- because my mental image of myself just will NOT square with reality. 

I noticed this becoming a problem about 1.5 years into my weightloss, but I thought I had taken reasonable (and helpful) steps to deal with it. Spoiler alert: it has never really gone away. 

I mentioned that I had an appointment with a plastic surgeon last week, to start the process of dealing with the loose skin on my torso. It was nice to hear an outside validation - I guess there is a scale, 0-1-2-3 (0 being the best, 3 being the worst) and my skin was categorized as a 2 by the surgeon. 

I asked him about my concerns (water retention, the difficulty of staying below 170 pounds/my TDEE being lower than expected), and finally I asked him why I  couldn‚Äôt lose more weight ‚Äî his response? Given that today‚Äôs topic is about body image? 

‚Äú‚Ä¶but, why would you want to lose more weight? Your BMI is 25?‚Äù He was genuinely confused.

Of course, my BMI is NOT 25, and I corrected him: it is, in fact, 27 (he had written my height down wrong), but that little movie scene has been playing in my head. Me, complaining I never got to the coveted Healthy BMI, and a literal plastic surgeon at a bariatric clinic looking puzzled. 

So, yeah. Wake up call. There is something extremely broken in my self-perception. I often feel like a failure BECAUSE I didn‚Äôt get to a healthy BMI. Like u/smilingjaguar, I often feel, well, fat. 

I worry about myself a little. I was an overweight/obese child who grew into a fat adult. I am
Objectively lighter than I have ever been as an adult. So where are these negative feelings coming from? Why am I so down on myself? Why can‚Äôt I see the big changes I have made? 

Sometimes I worry that it‚Äôs because I am too involved in ‚Äúdiet reddit.‚Äù I mod this subreddit and a 2 others (with possibly the most toxic one for my mental health being r/progresspics ‚Äî I am really starting to question if it is at all healthy for me to be constantly looking at before/after pictures). At the same time, my commitments to these communities are, in large part, what have made me successful. On the other hand, I think that the support I get here (like these weekly threads) more than outweighs any negative aspects. I live in a country where despite it being MY native language, English is NOT the native language. Finding an English-language mental health provider (let alone one who specializes in massive weight loss and it‚Äôs psychological aspects) is really not likely. I was clomping along in my stupid dutch with the plastic surgeon last week‚Äî and, although it‚Äôs a nice story that he got my height wrong (but still thought I looked like I had a healthy BMI); in reality, the mistake was most likely because I have a strong accent in Dutch, and he misunderstood me when I gave my height. Although, as an aside‚Äî I have known for YEARS that my weight problems would be fixed if I could just finally grow a little taller ;). 

I don‚Äôt have an answer as to why I am so negative about my self image so often - or why I truly struggle to see the changes. I think the long-term maintenance is a factor. It‚Äôs almost like a delayed-reaction: I have been maintaining VERY steadily for 1.5+ years (I do enjoy the impressed-looks I have gotten from the referring doctor/plastic surgeon about my weight loss graph!), and maybe it‚Äôs all starting to hit me. 

I lost weight very slowly (well, by the standards of what r/loseit and r/progresspics) ‚Äî the process was truly nearly 2 years. I don‚Äôt regret it- because obviously, my approach set me up for a very successful long term approach (once I pass 5 years of weight lost/maintained, I‚Äôm definitely starting The Unicorn Club!), but I do think it‚Äôs relevant that while I was losing, I NEVER thought I had ‚Äúlost weight.‚Äù I never noticed the changes quickly. It took 50 pounds before I tried new clothes, and honestly, another 50 before I got the clothes I am currently wearing out. I never woke up one day and thought ‚Äúyep, that was 15 pounds! Lost forever!‚Äù ‚Äî I knew water weight and fluctuations could happen. I never had huge weekly losses either- in fact, they were really quite modest: 1 to 1.5 pounds a week, which sounds like it would be noticeable, but in reality would be a series of weigh ins at (for example): 230.X, 230.X, 229.X, 231.X, 231.X, 230.X, 230.X, 228.X, 229.X, 229.X, and on and on. So, the process wasn‚Äôt instantaneous. Maybe now that I have been maintaining for a while, it‚Äôs like all that time where I was ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù to lose weight finally caught up to me? And now I am trying to make sense of it.

I grew up ‚Äúchubby‚Äù, but just because my friends at the time were honestly underweight and I had curvier genetics. I hovered between healthy/overweight most of my childhood, but I was active, my highest was probably around 140 lbs back then.

I suddenly became self-conscious sometime in my teens and started working out after my Dad stopped letting me participate in sports and I started eating healthier. The weight literally dropped off in three months (-15 lbs) and I was 125 lb. I got obsessed with being skinnier though and STRESSED when I‚Äôd gain *any* weight.

It didn‚Äôt work out and I think frustration and ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù, paired with my first car, less exercise, more sedentary studying in college... led to me gaining ~50 lbs in 2019. Then an additional 20 lbs in 2020, then an additional 20 lbs in 2021.

It's probably water from sweat and exhale.  Random mid-day weigh-ins like that don't tell us about our fat burning.  

Our bodies are not mostly composed of fat.  Our bodies are ~60% water (give or take several percent) by mass, and the amount changes from hour to hour, and day to day. The exact amount varies according to the rhythm of your digestive system, your food and beverage intake, sodium levels, hormones, activity, strains, etc..  [A diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Bnzgors.png) ^\[[source](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html)\] shows what a typical body at maintenance weight takes in and expels per day, most of it is water! **So, most of the weight changes we see on any given weigh-in are water changes, not fat changes.** 

Water weight is one reason we should weigh consistently: first thing in the morning, after using the toilet, but before dressing or eating/drinking. When you drink a glass of water your weight instantly goes up by 1/2 pound! However, even when being consistent, there will still be a lot of variation from day to day, so it's important not to get discouraged by that. 

Use a weight-smoothing app called [Libra \(for Android\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra&hl=en) or [Happy Scale \(for iPhone\)](https://happyscale.com/).   

One of these apps will help you see the trends more clearly with less of the volatile data noise of water.

There is one person, and one person only, who can speak to the state of your metabolism, and that is a physician.   More specifically, an endocrinologist.

If you are concerned about a metabolic issue, all it takes is a simple blood test from your doctor.  If something is off, they will refer you to an endocrinologist for further testing.  But if your blood tests haven‚Äôt ticked off any boxes to indicate metabolic health issues, then you‚Äôre likely normal.

I talk about fitness stuff with people who are into fitness. One of my coworkers does Crossfit, and another does triathlons, and we have stuff to talk about! I'm not going to discuss my run times with my coworkers who don't run, because I don't want to make them uncomfortable. 

I don't even talk to my boyfriend about my weight. He knows I've lost a bit - we got together when I was 50 pounds heavier - but again, it's not some I feel comfortable discussing. I don't need his support, and weight loss honestly hasn't been that hard to where I feel a need to vent. He knows I run, obviously, and we're talking about going hiking during the summer, but he just doesn't need to know where I am in my You Are Your Own Gym program - that would make him uncomfortable, as well as making me uncomfortable.

2) I'd get disappointed in the numbers on the scale and I'd give up - ""I was SO GOOD this week and I only lost 200g, this is garbage I give up"". And then I'd go back to old habits.

Related to this it also felt like I never got to experience those all-important formative years of youth that ""everyone else"" had (I didn't lose it until I was 27), and that I had fallen behind my contemporaries by at least a decade due to it.

I would strongly recommend a therapist but in the meantime, maybe take a look at the schedule and see where you can fit in meal prepping so that you're able to have prepared meals or items on hand.

How often do you **actually** feel dizzy? Or feel dehydrated or hungry? I would track every hour that you're awake ""12.00: hunger level 2. 1 PM: hunger level 3.5. 3 PM Hunger level 9, stomach ache, headache"" Then schedule your food prep so that when you're at your hungriest you have food on hand--in this example, prepare the food at 12 PM so it's ready by 3PM.

But also I'm not sure it needs to be said: hunger indicates how **soon** you should eat, **not how much**. 

As you are finding out, past a certain point, **more food will not last longer** in fact it will likely make you hungrier quicker as insulin floods your body to handle the extra energy sources. That's how you get insulin resistance which you **really** don't want.

So with all due respect, why are you trying to fix possible hunger with huge binges you don't enjoy, are not a solution to hunger, and take forever to prepare? 

I feel like there's something else going on here for sure.

I'm not sure what health issue requires prepping in a specific way, but if that's the case, do some research and see if there is any prepared food, raw food or shortcuts that you can take because obviously this isn't sustainable!",4,0,0,False,False,False,1646358787.0
t67av3,hza55cz,t1_hz9h75a,"Thanks so much for the reply, Ive taken in everything you said. When you say over-drink, do you mean alcohol from when I used to drink, or the over-water drinking. 

The alcohol drinking Im not sure what caused it, probably depression most likely that stemmed from a lot of things (my mom abandoned me, my dad passed away shortly after). This pain, despite trying not to let it bother me, must have bothered me. As for the water-drinking I do now (drinking water until I feel sick or get a headache). Its definitely this weird fear I have of being dehydrated or hungry.

The fear stems from becoming dizzy (or having low blood pressure) or even worse getting a panic attack from being dizzy or dehydrated. (I do have panic attack issues). I find if I eat and drink water I used to feel better, but this has spiraled out of control into me just binging to the point of it possibly being dangerous, but a lot of the times, I dont realize I am until its too late.

It really makes me feel sick though eating like that and drinking so much water like that. I still feel sick from my last meal and its been hours now since I wrote the post. Before bed I can have 5-6 glasses of water and have to get up all night to pee. Most I had was 9 glasses of water, but I try not to. I wont be thirsty though, its just Im scared of not doing it. Im scared I will get dehydrated in my sleep and have a panic attack in my sleep. (Its kind of irrational).

I have a stomach hernia, so sometimes I have to blend or at least mash up my food. This doesnt happen for all my meals but maybe 2 of them (the rest is regular food). So I just have this fear of...what if I get hungry and nothing is ready...and then I get dizzy...and then being more prone to having a panic attack. I have to make everything from scratch because I am lactose intolerant and a lot of premade meals have milk in them. 

So when stuff is ready I feel the need to binge, its causing me to over-eat and over-drink water and feel like absolute garbage. (and your right, I will snack after my binge eating). So it doesnt make me less hungry. Its awful. I want to control how much I eat and how much water I drink.

I need to remember what you said about hunger is about when I eat not how much. Strangely my brother has the same problem. He has this weird anxiety about eating more than he can handle (we were poor growing up so that could be it too). Had to ration food.

I should definitely see a therapist haha, because even I feel confused just writing everything out, its confusing trying to pinpoint why Im doing this. Its scary though. I will never ever realize Im doing it until I feel like Im going to puke. The water binging has been going on for 2 years now, the food binging is just recent. Also Im not diabetic I was checked, its raw anxiety. :( I know it is, because I have stayed up all night just to do my water drinking routines and now eating food. 

I have a hard time telling when Im hungry or thirsty. I used to be able to tell, but now its just like, more anxiety based, rather than eating and drinking. Im really sorry for the wall of text. Thanks so much for helping me. It really helped to write it all out.

I am going to start writing a journal and tracking what exactly Im doing. I want to try the meal prepping too so Im not so anxious about when I can eat next, because it will already be ready. Thanks again for your advice!

> I have so much loose skin on my stomach and back that has not improved at all since I began losing weight.

Yeah, that's definitely a real thing.  Your body has a 5-foot frame and once weighed twice its ideal weight.  I don't know your story (I know mine and I also weighed twice my ideal weight).  I'm very grateful that my body has been able to handle the excess weight that it handled for so long, but I have my own ""battle scars"" as a result.   I can wear certain nice clothes that aren't baggy, but those clothes now have to cover up my baggy skin beginning a few inches above my navel.    (My bigger clothes from before the weight loss couldn't show that area either.)

Here's the thing: it's a body that has been through a lot.  I have to see it as that.  I don't hate it; I appreciate it.   I am grateful that it didn't die.  I love that I can buy a lot of different kinds of clothes for it now (much more choice than I had when I was big).  

> I am going back to the gym this weekend. I was planning on easing into it with cardio but want to focus on some strength training. It's hard to get any motivation and I feel so hopeless.

Next to stopping smoking, there is no better thing we can do for our body than to give it proper exercise.   Not only does it help in every physical respect, the mental-health benefits are substantial as well.   

The motivation seems to be doing it's job:  you're going to the gym this weekend.   That's what the 'mot' in motivation is -- an emotional urge (""moved"") to do a thing.  Once you're there, though, the onus is on discipline.   The root word there is discipulus -- 'pupil' essentially.   You bring your body there *to train*.  Sometimes, it's not easy but it's the nature of training to harden our will and our body at the same time.  

> Can someone please provide advice 

Consider your purpose:  a longer, easier life, to maintain your hard-fought weight loss and enhance it, continue to wear a better selection of clothes than you could before, feeling better physically and mentally, knowing rationally as well as emotionally that you're doing right things simply because they ARE the right things you should do.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646343332.0

t63nif,hz8xwsx,t3_t63nif,"I have a lot of thoughts about this topic! It‚Äôs an interesting one for sure. Firstly I don‚Äôt personally believe in the idea of a body ‚Äòrefusing to get lower than x weight‚Äô because if that were the case then people wouldn‚Äôt become emaciated and/or die from starvation in famines and prisoner of war camps.

Ultimately in a modern western society it has never been harder to maintain a healthy slimmer body. We are facing things our grandparents generation didn‚Äôt really have to. There is a reason the majority of adults in the U.S/U.K are overweight and obese. Constant take out and social events at restaurants were not really a thing until the 1980s. Over abundance of cheap calorie dense meals and snacks were also not common place until the 70s/80s. And sedentary lifestyles were not really a thing either. Working in factories, labour intense household chores - you‚Äôd get 10-15k plus steps a day without even thinking about it  due to the nature of your life. 

But we‚Äôre facing an entirely different battle now. Most people work by sitting and staring at computer screen for 8-10 hours a day. Food is everywhere all the time. In order to maintain a healthy weight (a minority of the adult population) and the thinner side of that (a minority within a minority) generally happens one of two ways. Either you have a naturally small appetite and lack of interest in food, which means you consume exactly how much you need to maintain a slim weight through no effort- or you have the same exact enjoyment of food as everyone else but you chose to consciously maintain your weight (the choice most of losing weight have to make).

Truthfully most (not all) people who struggle with overeating and prone to being overweight tend to overestimate their level of physical activity and underestimate the amount of calories they consume in a day. Add in all the daily barriers of modern life and weightloss/healthy weight management starts to feel very impossible. So it can be easier to lean on things like ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just naturally big‚Äô or ‚Äòit‚Äôs impossible to lose weight or keep it off‚Äô. 

We live in an instant gratification culture and weight loss is never an instant process. Even starving yourself and working out x hours a day takes time to show results. A slow and steady process of maintaining a deficit will get anyone down to any weight they desire. It‚Äôs the mental blocks that stop people from getting there. Conscious weight loss is not a natural process, you have to fight every inherent instinct as well as all the modern outside temptations. It‚Äôs far from easy, otherwise no one would be overweight.

t63nif,hzar6at,t3_t63nif,"Maintaining 155lbs is not ""barely"" eating, especially if you're very muscular and exercising heavily, as you claim. It's not that your body refuses to go below that weight, it's just that your calorie consumption, lifestyle, and activity level when you're trying to lose weight are most balanced at that weight.   
  
In regards to your goal weight, I think developing sustainable habits and feeling good about the way you look should definitely come before getting down to a certain number.  You can definitely get to 140, but it might require diet and activity changes that aren't compatible with your lifestyle. It might also not be where you feel best. That's where you have to decide if you want to make those changes or aim for a higher weight.  
  
I have a goal weight that is difficult to maintain for me because it requires either a very high level of activity for the amount of calories I naturally consume, or a drastically reduced consumption of calories for the activity level I am used to. I've been working on fixing this by developing exercise habits that will give me a TDEE that matches my desired calorie consumption at my goal weight. It seems doable, but it requires lifestyle changes that I wasn't willing to make before. I'm willing to make them now, but I have doubts. What if the exercise routine isn't sustainable? What if I like the way I look when I'm 5-10lbs away? So at the end of the day I still prioritize sustainability over the number.  
  
To end my novel, I think you have a good approach. You've been losing weight with healthy habits that should help you maintain a lower weight. If I were you, I would try getting back to 155lbs first with your approach and see if you can maintain it with the new habits. It was difficult before, it might still be difficult now.

>!And well, looong story and quite a journey... To be honest, did it not the way I can recommend to anyone. Except to do things gradually. I started to eat 5 times a day, ballanced healthy food and things, in about 2019. That get me from 230 to 220 lbs. In late 2020 I stopped, this regular preparations of food and periodical eating, along with micromanagement made me fed up and bored, but this got me some insight on how my body functions, when I feel bad or good and similar things. Then in summer 2021 I had hard break up, but this relieved stress for some reason and I started to see things angry-red instead of depressionlike-dark, as it was before. Needed to have at least something to control in life - what fell on weight and eating habits, some sports to vent feelings - was fed up to the brim of my body dictating me its rules.(I'm your regular gamer, programmer and bookworm, and binging get me to the point, that any food wasn't so tasty anymore) Started to eat less and less often too. Deleted carbs(and most protein too, I believe, except nuts) from menu, so that I could reeducate my body how to burn fat en-masse. At some point get to one meal a day, and then something clicked - hey, I can go without food and cravings longer than one day. That feeling of control was overwhelming (couldn't think of not eating anything for one day before that, even one meal a day was seen as ridiculous). Started to do some fastings, increasing length in time - longest I went was 5 days. I was always taking vitamins and mineral supplements though.
When 170 lbs point was reached,  I started to do more intensive sports, but it is still plain calisthenics and running (well, that still got me at least some muscles, got visible abs and hide ribs) - for now I have a goal of developing long lasting endurance and heart health - and looking forward to find a gymnastics gym with trainer, need supervisor and advisor. Body control and strength of professional gymnasts amuses me, they look good too - don't think I would be able to reach half of their performance, but I need an ideal to reference. And at least food is tasty again, even bland one, and I can afford some sweets (if I feel like it, that occurs rarely now). All this lowered my stress levels, made my testosterone levels higher, and made me feel healthy and stronger, although the methods aren't considered healthy(and for a good reason) - but hey, if you listen to your body, maybe it's okay'ish?

If there's not a reason, here's a better option:

Lunch: 40g of protein and 22g of fats  
Snack: 40g of protein and 22g of fats

Personally, I have a higher carb intake.  Here's an example diet that I used when cutting (I'm 5'6"". in 2021, I went from 217lbs-->167lbs) :  


6am - Protein shake and sugar (workout) 250cals

7am - oats, whey, and peanut butter - 500 cals

10am - egg dish w/ veggies (sometimes steak) - 200 cals   

12p - chicken breast, rice, veggies  - 300ish cals

3pm - chicken breast and veggies 150cals 

6pm - dinner (often fish)  250 cals 

9pm - cottage cheese 80cals 

I also had probiotics frequently, miso, kimchi, pickles, sauerkraut, etc. as snacks to keep away the ""whey bloat.""   

\-----

Frankly, if you've not been eating fats at all for 3 months, I'd guess your hormones are all messed up.  I'd immediately begin eating healthy and bump your cals up to maintenance (maybe 2500 cals for you with that activity level?).  I'd also go to a doc ASAP and get checked.

I can‚Äôt verify if the above is true as it‚Äôs anecdotal, but they put the minimum calorie limit for women at 1200 calories for a reason (assuming you‚Äôre a woman, if you‚Äôre a dude and eating that little you are doing even more damage; mens limit is 1500), it‚Äôs not to be mean and slow your weight loss it‚Äôs the lowest a woman can eat safely over an extended period.

Bodies are efficient! If you're able to increase your lean body mass, the math changes a little in favour of weight loss. 

However, at any weight, cardiovascular activity is extremely good for your physical and mental health, and getting regular exercise has a larger effect size on your risk of major disease than weight loss attempts do. It's still very very good for you.

Also, regular exercise helps with many of the large behavioral/habit blocks people have with losing weight, but the increased activity makes a relatively small difference to how much food you burn in a day once you're used to it.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646284379.0

I just think it‚Äôs important to keep in mind how *few* calories you‚Äôre likely to burn through pure cardio vs. the number of calories you consume from even a small snack. 

I once participated in an interactive experiment at a science center, where you rode a stationary bike while watching an image of a sugar cube on a screen. As you burned energy, the sugar cube slowly disappeared. 

Let‚Äôs just say no one doing the experiment burned through much of that tiny sugar cube. And a single bottle of ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù Vitamin Water (for example) contains the equivalent of *eight* sugar cubes.

I've found that many of the so-called 'diet' foods out there that are low-fat, etc. are loaded with sugar, which will mess up any kind of diet immediately. That includes the fat-free yogurts out there. This article ([https://www.businessinsider.com/low-fat-yogurt-high-in-sugar-2016-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/low-fat-yogurt-high-in-sugar-2016-4)) sheds some light on the matter.

I've also found that the only way I've been able to consistently lose weight is by cutting out processed foods (sadly also includes McDee's, Burgerking, etc because lots of their products have hidden sugars in them), and it lets me directly control what I consume. More work at meal time, but worth the effort - and I feel better overall.

Alright, so I started around 135kg and then i dropped to 98kg and then got hard jacked back up to 112-115kg (I'm 182cm, 6'). So technically im obese as fuck. When 135kg i was obese, at 98kg i was still overweight and at 114kg im again obese.

However there's a big big big difference in the % of fat that I had on me. I'm pretty ashamed to admit, but actually having a big gut and fatpad around my penis meant that some positions were harder to manage - especially if the girl is thicc too - and it was just harder to get deeper. When coupled with the fact that your loveboomer looks smaller it becomes a massive massive performance damper. 

Imagine being self conscious, not being able to get 'good' position for good penetration and gassing out more quickly - add into that the fact that ""your fatter version looks worse than your healthy version"" in terms of attractiveness and you have a whole melting pot of ways in which sex can be worse.

It doesn't mean you can't have a good time, it doesn't mean your self consciousness is warranted and all that jazz.. But you take away all those negative pressures and your sex life actually is just enhanced. It means that getting with a girl is generally super exciting rather than a bit of a worry. And let me tell you any worry or negativity or 'being in your own head' is prime grade boner killer.

I used to use to [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) because they have a fairly strict process for adding foods into the public database and you can trust the listings a lot more. Now I use [Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/) because the Cronometer app is really ugly and I think Lifesum is a good balance between functionality and design. That being said, both of these apps skew very heavily towards North American cuisine. For example: They have Chicken Parmsean but not D√∂ner.

This second method is more useful.   The random mid-day clothed reading has no idea if you've just eaten or are about to eat, just drank a big tumbler of liquid, need to eliminate waste, etc.  

Our bodies are not mostly composed of fat.  Our bodies are ~60% water (give or take several percent) by mass, and the amount changes from hour to hour, and day to day. The exact amount varies according to the rhythm of your digestive system, your food and beverage intake, sodium levels, hormones, activity, strains, etc..  [A diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Bnzgors.png) ^\[[source](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html)\] shows what a typical body at maintenance weight takes in and expels per day, most of it is water! **So, most of the weight changes we see on any given weigh-in are water changes, not fat changes.** 

##Water weight is one reason we should weigh consistently: first thing in the morning, after using the toilet, but before dressing or eating/drinking. 

Make that the only weigh-in that you do, and its results are simply a datapoint in a longer trend.  **Only the trend ""counts""** for the purposes of judging how well your effort goes.

When you drink a glass of water your weight instantly goes up by 250-300 grams! However, even when being consistent, there will still be a lot of variation from day to day, so it's important not to get discouraged by that. 

Use a weight-smoothing app called [Libra \(for Android\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra&hl=en) or [Happy Scale \(for iPhone\)](https://happyscale.com/).   

One of these apps will help you see the trends more clearly with less of the volatile data noise of water.

You should definitely be losing weight at a deficit like that, I say that from my own current experience. Honestly at that weight and even now I didn't and don't really count calories I have a rough idea of what the caloric content of common foods I eat is and roughly estimate it and my weight loss has been significant but steady. But you have to be real with yourself about what you're eating for that to work well.

  
It may also be worth checking your sodium intake, when I eat out, even adjusting to a proper portion for how calorie dense food is, the sodium content is ludicrous and easily messes with the number on the scale for a few days.

  
You really have a lot of wiggle room for what you can eat at that weight, so long as you aren't eating out often(or getting large portions) or eating terrible frozen meals. A lot of advice you'll find on this sub is not really going to apply as strictly to you.

  
I do recommend getting into strength training/lifting if you have any interest in doing so. I don't go to a gym but have an adjustable steel club and kettlebell at home I use daily and for me it's easily been the best thing to come out of the lifestyle changes I've made recently.

this is Day 2. I almost reached my goals from yesterday. Here's how they turned out:

* Tracked all calories? Check.
* Calorie limit? (1614 / 1620kcal), so check.
* Steps taken? (6843 / 7000), not a check.

So, I'm considering this an overall success. Regarding the steps, I'm going to take another, smaller walk in the evening today (in addition to my morning walk), which will take me over the step count. These are my goals, again:

* Track all calories.
* Stay with calorie limit (+/- 50)
* Walk 7000 steps.

t5klsw,hz5q11e,t3_t5klsw,"Hi everyone - I am new!  
Yesterday was Day 15 of a long, long challenge ahead.  
Started out at age 39(f) with 92.5 kg for 145 cm (yes I am THAT short, with normal proportions though. And I am morbidly obese at this weight)

Lots of dieting groups don't really welcome me I guess because you are forbidden to post calorie goals under 1200... And that's where I am at right now. I am using the loseit! app with a goal of losing 0.5 kg a week and alternating budgets (so a few less on weekdays and a few more on Fri/Sat/Sun) and it is already at 1120/1289 for that with my wfh desk job (not counting exercise which upps it a bit)

I feel fine with it. I mean my height is very petite, you can't expect the same lower limit to count for me too I guess? 

*So I hope I am allowed to post here...*

Weighed in at 90.1 kgs today. Stuck to my goals the whole 15 days so far - both exercise (avg of 30 mins/day) and food. Happy it seems to go a bit faster than planned because there sure will be days where I slow down, and at the end of the journey (goal weight is 52) I assume it will be very slow due to my height. But its the first ones that matter the most because losing those will mean that I will be able to move again better which helps a myriad of other factors.

Not doing this for just looking good but also for being fit and not so ashamed of myself anymore. To be proud of myself. I was an gymnast and acrobat once, and I miss just being able to express myself very actively.

I also want to start eating better food, but I am making the changes slowly. I will likely eat like this for the rest of my life, so i take my time finding stuff I actually like. I plan ahead, pick curbside pickup for shopping (thanks for saving me from temptations, Covid ;) ) and then precook/preportion my meals - because if there is something I am drawn to it is comfort and the easiest path. This is something I have done in the last year or so, so not new. I just start paying attention and making smarter choices now.

I have ""held"" my weight over the last about 3 years through IF, which comes very naturally to me and has become my new way of feeding myself, a good start to reverse the gain :)

I'm not a dietician but I did spend 3 years in a life science degree and then 5 years in med school so balance that as you wish

Its true that simple carbs (sugar basically) are absorbed faster, they need less enzyme and acid to break them down. Because when you eat them they go into your blood stream very quickly, the hormone in charge of stopping your blood sugar getting to high gets produced in large amounts. That's insulin.

Everyone here is jumping to insulin=fat. But insulin does a bunch of things. Without insulin our body wouldn't be able to use most of what we eat. Which is why before it was discovered children with diabetes would waste away before the age of 10.

Lets see how much I remember (I'm a working doctor now)
Insulin:
1. Gets the liver to turn glucose into glycogen. This is the body's primary storage of glucose. The liver can then turn glycogen into fat if it feels like it has enough glycogen. That's a slower process and doesn't happen meal to meal.
2. Gets the muscles to store some glycogen. This is so when you have to use your muscles next (they require a lot of energy) theres an energy source right there to use. I think muscles can do that too
3. Tells your brain and other hormones basically to chill out because we arent starving anymore. Which can be bad in a spike because you feel good from simple sugars but when it drops again you'll feel super hungry.

So simple sugars and insulin spikes arent good for you. But I see no reason to believe that despite the same amount of energy absorbed, the speed of absorption will make you fatter in a meaningful way.

Also I feel like insulin is being scapegoated as a cause of the problem but its really just trying to help. High blood sugar is far more dangerous to the health. Justice to insulin ü•∫",265,0,0,False,False,False,1646226552.0

t4xjie,hz2020o,t3_t4xjie,"TL;;DR: In dieting, there are no magic bullets.  CICO is the way, but how you get there is up to you.  Low-carb fights hunger, but denser calories mean less food.  It‚Äôs not a free-for-all.  Regular carb levels likely mean you‚Äôll be hungry more often.  Talk to your nutritionist, get the hard facts, and decide what you can adopt for long term success.

OP, I was told the same thing as you, food type matters and ‚Äúnot all calories are the same.‚Äù  That is true, but your nutritionist needs to have a deeper conversation with you, because CICO works and ultimately, how weight loss occurs.  After a couple of months eating very low carb, my satiety waned, and I started consuming more of the same low/no-carb foods because I was hungry.  And my weight loss stalled.  So yes, on one hand, the TYPE of food matters because the body responds differently and triggers hunger differently as a result.  HOWEVER - if you eat 3000 calories of ANY food and your BMR allows for 1500, you will gain, not lose.  I loved how I felt on keto, but it was not sustainable for me.  Low-carb lifestyle adopters know it‚Äôs not a free-for-all and have tremendous willpower.  There is no magic - you need to do what works for you.  Have another, more detailed conversation with your nutritionist and ask them to explain their rationale.  Then decide what you‚Äôll be able to adopt as a lifestyle, because dieting - no matter the program - is a short term solution.  Personally, I love fruit too much to give it up.

t4xjie,hz3sxpc,t3_t4xjie,"Did nutrition in year 2 of biology degree couple of years back.
Also it's in biology a lot as you say.
I think she's worded it badly but by being vague, she's not wrong.

Insulin raises up to knock down glucose in the blood.
After you eat this glucose level rises and that's natural. 
But if you were to put sugar in tea or drinks or foods, then your insulin levels are kicking it down every time BUTTT
you have more periods throughout the day when glucose is in your blood, on a level that is higher than you body wants to have. Insulin doesn't work instantly. Sugar levels raise up slowly. Another example is, if you were to have a sugary drink but instead of drinking it in ten minutes or twenty, you actually sipped it for an hour, well your insulin is finding out it needs to keep going around your blood over and over again.

The point is, while that sugar is high (glucose) , your body will store lots of what you eat as fat. When your sugar is low, it will use up a large amount of the glucose being released as energy to go. If you are empty stomach for long enough and there is a slight lack of glucose in the blood,  you will induce gluconeogenesis where the body releases stored fat (OR PROTEINS) to be converted into glucose. I can't remember exactly if it's fat and proteins together, or if it's one then the other. But this is the reason you can't build muscle without enough protein in the day, because your body will actually take protein back out of muscle/degrading muscle tissue in order to produce enough energy and so on, so you don't want protein coming out of your body- your body IS ALL protein so a shortage of it causes millions of tiny issues that will increase with time. Gluconeogenesis is a slower chemical reaction so we don't actually have as much energy to go when using this system. 

 If you are absolutely starving say, at 4am, during the fast, your liver actually starts ketoneogenesis, where fat is now taken out of storage and converted into a special sugar for the brain to use. If your brain runs out of sugar it will die very quickly so your body has an emergency system to keep your brain fed while you sleep and go hungry. 

These are all examples of how the body uses or releases energy. So if you are pumped full of sugar, simple carbs which are quickly covered into sugar, your body will grab as much as it can and convert it very quickly into fat.
If your body is hungry, low on sugar, then it will efficiently use up what ever food you put in it. 

That's one reason why it's harder to lose weight if you have elevated glucose in your blood too often through the day.
That's why, if you sleep with a full stomach, your body may not reach ketoneogenesis and so no fat cells will be taken away/reduced. 

I don't think I answered all of your question but hope I've answered some. 
The way I look at it, is that if I eat enough nutrients (protein, carbs, essential fats, vitamins, minerals), my body won't crave as much food- and I won't accidentally degrade the muscles or tissues in my body by forcing it to basically eat itself to get those nutrients back.

I've just found this info (below) whilst browsing for my own inspiration to get back into a diet. This is what I wanted to say but didn't know how. I think it answers the rest of your question about why a dietitian might say there's different types of calories. It's not the calories though, because that just means energy. It's more correct to say empty or dense calories. If you eat too much empty calories your body will be running on empty and request more.

 Nutrient Comparison

When you cut down on calories, you're also at risk for losing nutrients. As a result, each calorie you consume should be nutrient-dense to be sure you get a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals. Two slices of wheat bread provide significantly more calcium and vitamin E than a small wheat bagel; otherwise, the two have about the same nutrients. Both choices are almost equal when it comes to the carbs that will sustain your energy as you reduce calories.

t4xjie,hz2kk3m,t1_hz1tr1b,"/u/DeliriousFudge's answer isn't completely correct.  I've done both keto and CICO at different times of my life and both work to some extent.  


Insulin does lots of things that are useful and important, particularly for athletes.  But for people with large amounts of weight to lose it also shuts down the primary pathway for fat metabolism.  Helping the liver produce glycogen is cool, but an over abundance of glycogen in the liver ends up being stored as fat can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  


Insulin also isn't the only hormone responsible for storing body fat.  Another wonderful hormone is leptin.  Leptin is produced in the liver and primarly functions to metabolize fructose (the sugars you get from fruit).  Rather than following the insulin pathway to store energy in the muscles or liver as well as body fat, leptin goes straight to body fat.  The biggest problem here is that corn syrup is 50% fructose and high fructose corn syrup is 55%+.  Which means if you take something like a soda that is basically all HFCS you are storing 55%+ as body fat by default with no option to use it for other things.  


Low carb diets aren't the end-all be-all for everyone for losing weight and over time consistency is more important.  A low carb diet will be more successful for a obese, type 2 diabetic, BMI 37, with metabolic syndrome than straight CICO if it is adhered to.

t4xjie,hz7d386,t1_hz1ekuh,"Insulin is a great factor in weight loss.  It affects your blood sugar and other hunger hormones.  Eating refined carbohydrates and highly processed foods is extremely easy to do and break down.  Because you have a lot of carbs in your bloodstream, your body puts out a lot of insulin.  Your blood sugar will rapidly drop and then some, which makes you hungry again.

However, eating whole foods, they take longer to break down and slower for carbs to be released.  Your body doesn't have to flood your bloodstream with insulin so you don't have the big crash afterwards.

However, for me, the big thing I found that was pointed out (can't remember where) was that your highly processed foods (candy, fast foods, packaged meals, etc) is really easy to eat, but doesn't fill you up at all.  I can easily go to McDonald's and pound 2 Big Mac's and a large fry and a mcflurry.  That's almost 2000 calories.  However, eating a huge plate of food where 1/3 is a leaner protein, 1/2 is a veggie and the remaining is a complex carb (BTW, this is an easy way to portion your dinner plate to help you lose weight), I am going to get just as full, because the calorie density is a lot less with whole foods.  However, I'm going to stay full a lot longer than I would after McDonald's.  On top of this, the calories from my good meal are better than the calories of my bad meal since I also am getting a lot of vitamins and minerals, which helps my body.

The final piece of the puzzle that has helped me with this is that you shouldn't be 'dieting'.  Instead, you should find good food choices that you enjoy and stick with those most of the time.  When your want something considered a cheat, don't beat yourself up about it.  If you've been good, let yourself have that dessert or go out to eat at that restaurant.  However, maybe make a better choice.  Get a kids shake instead of a large or get a salad instead of beans and rice, etc.  Enjoy the food, but don't go crazy on it.  It's a treat.

BEST advice I have for your mindset is to remember: there is NO way you will put in the consistent effort like this for 1 year and not see any results. Give yourself 6 months and stop paying attention to your ""progress"" (i.e. weight, before/after pics. just drop it). Instead, each day, focus on checking the boxes you need to check to move 1% closer to your goal. Just consistency. Meditative consistency. This consistency is going to take you WAY further than being motivated by outcomes (outcomes are not motivating! they will NOT come quick enough for them to be motivating at first!)   


Especially as ladies, we just do not know if you tipping point for seeing massive changes is 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks or 6 months.   


For now, try to focus on the process and the day to day. Focus on the fact that TODAY you took all the steps you needed to see results long term. You did the damn thing, and if you keep doing it, you will see results.   


Once you see tangible results, then you can really focus on how good those results made you feel in tandem with your love for your routine and consistency. It's a good feeling. It's one that only comes with kind of some plateauing progress wise, but that is natural. As is your disappointment! Refocusing helps so much though.

1) Whenever I feel like I have hit a plateau, I change something up. I find new recipes to try out, I switch up my workouts, and give myself a new challenge (in February I did a 100 mile walking challenge and walked 4-6 miles every day while listening to fun new audiobooks and podcasts).

2) Be easy on yourself! I have had a habit of talking down to myself (""You're worthless. You can't do this. You're a lazy pos"" etc) and it doesn't change anything / makes it harder to find the motivation and discipline to move forward because when you hear that over and over you start to believe it.

t4qi33,hz16xem,t3_t4qi33,"Wow there are a lot of uninformed people on this thread! I am a professional singer already and now studying opera. 

It is true that losing weight can have an impact on your singing voice, but this depends on how much you lose, and is also subjective. For example, Maria Callas went from nearly 100kg to stick thin. There‚Äôs a difference - you can look it up on YouTube - but it is only moderate to my ear, and vastly overstated by many. 

I need to lose some weight to get better roles, and I have been worried about how this would affect my singing voice. Discussing this with my teacher, she mentioned that since so much of the heavy lifting (in opera anyway) is done by the bone structure and hard palate, it wouldn‚Äôt make a huge difference to the sound quality. 

A friend of mine, also a professional singer and doing some opera, recently lost about ten kg and said it actually made her sing better because she felt more energised. 

So a) whatever differences there may be are subjective anyway

b) how much you lose will be the determining factor in how different your voice is 

c) it may in fact make your singing better. 

It is certainly also true for me that any physical exercise I do; even something as gentle as yoga or swimming, makes a huge difference to how free my voice sounds.

Now, counting calories is different, because instead of changing your macros, you're counting numbers, and numbers add up towards a bottom line. You are justified in counting calories if that is your method. If anything, measuring means you're actually cooking instead of scanning barcodes and that is healthy.

People in comas do something similar, a nutritional slurry that keeps them alive, so theoretically yes, but there are several issues where being awake makes this difficult. The primary issue you will run into is you need satiety as well. Your brain believes your body needs to feel like it's been eating. That's not being full, but just knowing something is in there. Liquid diets have been around for a while, and while that first week will show results, it is often lost in the subsequent weeks as your brain, wanting something with more substance (aka, solid food), will ultimately push you into binging. This will obviously negate all losses and usually results in a gain. It's the same reason most super restrictive diets fail, boredom gets the better of you. 

I'm also not sure you could find a single pill or even a small handful that could replace the nutrient diversity of a well-planned, balanced meal. It would be more like taking 40 or so pills a day, if you were trying to replace all your vitamins and minerals with supplements.

t5dtrn,hz4jij6,t1_hz4bkla,"Three things here:

1) If it's not motivating you then it may not the actual root of why you're seeking change, it could just be a symptom of whatever is subconsciously driving you. Dig way deeper into that feeling of wanting to be comfortable and find the source. Is it your body itself that makes you uncomfortable? Is it that it limits things you can do physically? Socially? Is it the way you feel people perceive you? You've got to ask yourself that stuff until you hit the core of it.

I know that sounds like New Age horseshit but our brains are complex machines and sometimes you've got to pop the hood and dig around in there to figure out wtf is going on in there.

2) When you go to workout what is it you feel? When you decide not to do it, why? Like what's the emotion there? The next time you go to workout take note of that.

3) Do you find yourself unmotivated often? Unmotivated when it comes to a lot in life? How do you feel generally? How has life been going for you? A lack of motivation in general is often a symptom of depression, and depression is 100% a thing you can treat and get on the other side of. I'm not a doctor and I'm not going to armchair you here, but it might be a thing to consider if you feel unmotivated in general.

Short of all of that... sometimes in life we have to just totally force ourselves to do something important that we don't enjoy, or accept defeat... and defeat is pretty soul-crushing after a while.

People actually can end up looking sickly skinny at their goal weight too if they haven‚Äôt been resistance training to **maintain** the lean mass they had before they started their weight loss. 

So, the thing about having a goal weight, is that while it gives you a concrete number to work towards, it‚Äôs completely arbitrary. I‚Äôm going to use myself as an example here, my goal weight as a teen was 140lbs, I hit 140lbs and I was unhappy, I was unhappy because I looked skinny-fat. I wouldn‚Äôt learn till years later that the problem wasn‚Äôt really that I needed to lose more weight, to be honest, dressed in clothing, I actually looked sickly skinny. Naked I had some pudge around the belly. What the problem actually was is that in my endeavor to lose weight, I wasn‚Äôt really resistance training, and while I was losing fat, I was also losing lean mass. My physique was bad, my posture was bad, my body composition was all out of whack.

Today I weigh 150lbs and I look WAY thinner than at 140. I will also never likely weigh 140lbs again without losing lean mass, which is the exact opposite of what I‚Äôm working towards. 

I have regular fluctuations around -1/+5 lbs depending on hydration, activity, and the previous night‚Äôs dinner to when I weigh myself. In other words, the number on the scale really doesn‚Äôt matter much at all, not in comparison to my body composition measurements, which tell a more whole story of what I have going on. 

My body fat percentage is on the decline and my lean mass percentage is on the rise, as a result, I look lean, I‚Äôm starting to look pretty muscular, and my posture is much better than it used to be. I don‚Äôt look sickly skinny, I look healthy.

They see you eating differently or never see you eating any more, and tend to extrapolate falsely from that and conclude you are starving yourself. 

They are used to being the slim one, or the toned one, and on an unconscious level they feel uncomfortable with the idea of you suddenly being the same size as them, or smaller, or fitter. 

They worry about their own weight. If you are losing a lot, it makes them realise uncomfortably that they could be losing some weight too. Unconsciously, they would prefer you to stay a few kilos fatter than the charts recommend, so they can feel better about being a few kilos fatter than the charts recommend.

I was a healthy weight per the charts, but I looked so thin in my face. I still had pudge because my body just likes storing some fat at my belly. And I was eating like a trash panda. 

It also wasn't sustainable long term. Without the dance rehearsals, I quickly went back to the 130s because that's just my equilibrium. So that's what I'm shooting for again (130-140).

t55yxp,hz3bta0,t3_t55yxp,"The typical recommendation is try to lose 0.5-1% body fat per week. There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary reason is that most people lose weight with a ""reasonable"" amount of exercise and restriction of food intake to form their caloric deficit. A deficit of 1,000 calories per day for a typical person that is overweight or obese (but not ""excessively obese) would involve an hour of exercise AND eating below their TDEE by another 5-700 calories every single day without any cheat days. That puts most ""typical"" people trying to lose weight around 1,200-1,500 calories per day, which is generally considered about the lowest to safely lose weight without medical supervision and burning around 2,200-2,500 calories per day.

Now, these hard-core trainers, on the other hand, are probably working out harder, longer, and more often. So instead of 1 hour burning 2-400 calories like a typical gym-goer, they're probably burning 4-600 calories per hour. Instead of spending 1 hour a day at the gym working out, they're probably spending 4-6 hours a day working out between teaching classes, working out for themselves, and pushing themselves to get back in shape. As such, they're gonna find that they can hit a 2,000+ calorie deficit every day while still eating 2-3,000 calories every day. They're getting plenty of nutrition and they're still having a bigger caloric deficit than if a normal person just didn't eat at all that day.

Their TDEE is just sooo much higher than an average person trying to lose weight that the normal suggestions don't really apply to them is pretty much what it comes down to.

It's fair to assume that for these shows they're working under the supervision of a doctor (I know at least one episode I watched involved a doctor giving input/direction, so I'd assume they all have that supervision) as well, who will monitor things and make sure they aren't going too far (in either direction).",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646251487.0

Sorta... but it's so common a phenomena that one could hardly say that its anything but a good question. 

Let's say you're 6'0 160 and you look in the mirror and you still see that your pants press in on your hips and there's a little muffin puffing out over the top of the beltline.  Let's even predict that will happen, or something like it, because we tend to be flaw-finders when we look at ourselves in the mirror.   None of us guys look in the mirror going, ""hey, that guy looks hot!""  We're at least looking for the stain on our shirt or the hairline getting thinner.  The mirror is a flaw detector.

> I'm looking for advice to either help get my mind in a place that I can accept my body and not always be ""working"" towards a goal in my head that may not actually be achievable or for how people can balance maintaining weight loss while trying to also maintain/gain muscle. I know these are somewhat opposite goals, which is where the mental struggle comes in.

Maintain is a verb.  Verbs are action words.   If ""accept my body"" means that I no longer need to be concerned with weight, fitness, and health then I've probably taken a wrong turn in my logic.  We know what happens to our things when they're neglected, and the same thing will happen if we neglect our body.

You can lose weight gradually and eke out small muscle gains.  That's quite doable.  Its not the fastest weight loss.  It's not the fastest strength or hypertrophy gains.  It's the middle.  But what I would advise you to do is to not set results goals but to set process goals.   What are you going to do, when, and how often?   That you're 6'0 180 again might be a vision, but make your goal to eat at a ~300 Calorie average deficit with IF and CICO tracking.   Having a 200 lb 1RM might be a vision, but make your goal to lift at least 3x a week in good form, increasing something in your routine (weight or reps) at least weekly so that you creep toward your vision.   

Muscle definition is a goal of yours -- it's going to be tough at 195.  You can build size which is half of it, but you'll probably want a lower BMI/bodyfat% to really get the definition. 

The one thing you have to accept about your body is that it is what it is right now.   The past is cemented in history.  The future is too much out of our control.  All we have is right now and all we can do right now are the things within our willful choices.  That sounds limiting but it is also freeing: we don't have to worry about 99% of what we're worrying about.  The 1% that we can change and do is enough for now.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646241502.0

Second of all, it sounds like you have a really negative attitude and unrealistic goals and expectations. It did not take you a day to gain 10kg, it will not take you a day to lose 10kg. 

It takes longer than a day. You need to be consistent for a long time and I would recommend somethign healthier than cornflakes and milk. No one really is the scientific mystery they think they are when it comes to weight loss.

Your day to day fluctuations in weight are due to so many things other than actual weight gain / loss. 0.5kg is the same amount you'll ""gain"" if you drink a pint of water. My weight goes ""down"" by 0.1-0.2kg every time I use the toilet. That means nothing. You need to think longer term and consistently. 

It sounds like you are trying to lose weight by starving yourself. You have 10kg to lose, so you will need a longer term plan to get there. You can't keep starving yourself as it will affect your mental health and overall health - you don't want to be losing muscle and bone mass, you want to be losing fat. The way to lose fat is to eat below your maintenance calories, whilst eating at least 1.5g of protein per 1kg of body weight and doing some strength training.

Grab some easy pre-made options to keep in the freezer for nights where you're not in the mood for cooking or eating meal-preps. 

The first couple weeks of cutting out junk food are tough, you will definitely have cravings to battle. Keep yourself busy with hobbies, chores and exercise. But it becomes easier and easier the longer you stick it out. Your tastebuds will get used to normal food again.

I have re-introduced calorie reduction after getting it under control, but I still bump up to maintenance about once a week when I'm very hungry and eat about 500cal over maintenance maybe 3-5 days a month because of my mandatory ""you're allowed to eat strong cravings right away"" rule.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646248370.0

Next up is finding better escape foods. If you need to hit the escape button and break up your diet, find foods that will satisfy the cravings you're having while still being healthy.

Don't overstrain yourself, you are not competing with anyone. Make eating your habit, your lifestyle, that would never end - dieting for a time and then returning to old eating habits would only bring you so far or even make it worse. Mindset is a key, work on it. You don't need to be guilty for binge eating, it only makes you stressful, and stress is a bitch - definitely counterproductive for fat burning. And to lose weight you don't need any exercises at all (but they help to preserve muscles and strength, yes).

If you suddenly overrestrict yourself on calories, your body probably would go in ""we are starving, need to preserve and replenish!!!""mode. 

Try eating on your normal(for your age and weight, I mean, maybe a little bit more) calories level for some time, and then start lowering it gradually. Avoid fast carbs and sweets, they spike insulin, and after the spike your bloodsugar level would drop, possibly making you hungrier than before.

Try not only  calculate calories, but also taking a look at glycemic index and macronutrient and fiber ballance. There is also reddit Volumeeating, on how to eat more food, getting less calories.

P.s. I can make 1 week fastings(but don't do this, my body got used and trained to it, gradually - before, in first 30 years of my life, I never thought, that you can eat nothing for a whole day and not even notice it), eating nothing at all - and I binge too from time to time, it's allright xD

Like, I still have my binges, but I try to go as far as I can without a binge, which is usually about 2-3 days, 4 if I'm lucky. (Before I worked on it, I was binging 2-3 times a day.) To help deal with it, I calculated my BMR. And tried to stick to it. And am in the process of learning that food is energy, not a fix. 

Another thing: ALWAYS write down food. We have so much access to a nutrition label and calorie count, whether it be in person or online (even if it's an approximate count). Whenever I have my meal, I log my calories *during* my meal, so I don't worry about it after. And it helps to remind me of where I'm at and where I want to be. (Also may help to keep the book out in the open, or where you eat most on the page that correlates with the day.)

Calories: So I have been playing with calorie cycling for my cycle (hehe) because I'm noticing I get super hungry the week before my period, the first 4 days of my period, and then I'm not very hungry after my period, yet I still make sure to hit my calories. So I had heard the concept and decided to give it a go. Usually my cals every day were 1600, and I'd usually end up at 1700 during my period. So now the first 2 weeks of my cycle my goal is 1500, then the week before I'm going to aim for 1600, and 1600-1700 during my period. So anyways my cals will fluctuate but we will see how it goes!

Exercise: I weight lift 4 days a week in the home gym and just added a conditioning and stretching day, so I'll keep that up for March.

23F 5‚Äô5 SW: 175ish GW: 135 CW: ???

I frequented here a while ago, ultimately making my goal weight just under a year ago. But, I recently climbed back to my starting weight of 175‚Äìwhere I was this time in 2020. 

This time, the reason is that I was pregnant! Baby arrived healthy last month, and I‚Äôm excited to get back to my feel-good weight. While I was pregnant, I did my best to stay active, walking my dog an hour every day when I could no longer go running or do Pilates classes. I also did a lot of prenatal yoga on YouTube in my last trimester. However, I‚Äôll admit that my eating habits slipped a bit. (Baby did love those Oreos!)

I weighed 175 at my last appointment. I don‚Äôt want to weigh myself again until my 6 week post-birth appointment, but I imagine I‚Äôm now somewhere around 145-155. My birth was easy, but I‚Äôm still recovering, so my goals right now focus on building back up good eating habits and going for walks/stretching, with running goals added once I am cleared to do so. :)

Eat 1,900-2,000 cals: 1/31

I can already tell that Im shaping up to be skinny fat and my booty is disappearing, so Ive accepted the slower weight loss that will come with strength training.

Ive decided to up my calories this month, and build out a Strength program that I plan to stick with for 8 weeks. The last time I attempted Strength training my appetite skyrocketed, I didnt have my sweet tooth or binge eating under control, I didnt understand my bodies water fluctuations, and it was just a horrible cycle of scale fluctuations & 3000+ calorie days. Suprisingly I didnt gain any weight those 6 weeks and looking back at libra I was actually losing, but it sure didnt feel like it at the time! I have no idea how it will turn out this time, but I can say Im in a way better place with all of those things and Im determined to stick it out.

* Dance. I already do, but because I can't speak and must absolutely never sing or hum until I'm better, all I can do is dance.

* Stay interested in minimizing sugar intake, maximizing protein, a good dose of fats, and not be afraid of carbs. Carbs have their place and they are not my enemy.

You are 5'6"" and currently weigh 125 lbs, and feel awful because you've gained 10 lbs throughout undergrad and want to lose that extra weight. 

It's really, really normal to gain a bit of weight from 19-23. The overwhelming majority of human beings don't consistently maintain their adolescent high school weight all through adulthood. Your current BMI is 20.2, which is on the low side of healthy. Your goal weight of 115 lbs would put your BMI at 18.6 which is about as low as you can get before dipping into underweight territory. 

I'm concerned that your hyperaware focus on your weight, and on getting your weight as low as it can go, and angst about eating a late night bowl of ramen (which is an incredibly normal thing to do), plus the fact that you literally are always thinking about food: you sound like you're verging into eating disorder territory. 

>So it's like past midnight and I just caved and ate instant noodles (for the first time in a while since I rarely eat ramen) but now I feel so guilty and kind of disgusted with myself.

Also I ended up gaining weight because of some pretty bad eating habits the past year or so where my weight increased by 5lbs because of things like binge eating an entire loaf of bread at midnight. 

The ramen thing was bad because I don't think eating a bowl of ramen at 3am because I'm stressed about work is normal or healthy. I've stopped binge eating at ridiculously late hours of the night/right before bed because I feel pretty gross having to sleep with a full stomach. However, I still have some pretty bad eating habits like constantly eating until I'm stuffed, having like 3 dinners because I'm in a snacky mood even though I'm not actually hungry, or eating a bunch of unhealthy stuff (pastries, chocolate, other carbs) instead of real meals. These are the kinds of things I'm trying to work on but honestly it's so hard when I'm just constantly thinking about my meals or thinking about my schedule for the day and how food fits into the picture. 

I'm trying to be better about not constantly thinking about food and actually learning to eat when I'm truly hungry and not because I'm bored or tired or just procrastinating on doing something productive.

I would recommend you also increase the cardio you are doing. 3-5x a week for 20-30 minutes of cardio which has your heart rate in the optimum zone, for your age should be between 97bpm and 157bpm will both improve your fitness and burn even more calories!

What are you eating? Protein from fish or vegan, and vegetables is pretty low calorie and very filling.

I try to get most of my protein from my diet, but that can be hard on a deficit, so I usually have to drink a protein shake a day, alternating between whey and casein.

Otherwise, I usually eat 600 calories for breakfast, 400 calories midday, and 500-600 calories dinner, and then 400-600 calories snacks. Typical breakfasts include yoghurt with granola, scrambled eggs, oats, tuna, and sometimes leftovers. Midday is usually fruit, some quarg or cottage cheese, and protein powder, or I eat a tuna wrap. Dinner varies a lot, but I try to focus on protein rich foods, and it's currently about 50/50 meat (chicken, fish, and pork mostly) and vegetarian (chickpeas and other legumes). I haven't eaten fast food in about 4 years. Snacks is usually a protein shake (when needed), nuts and dark chocolate. Sometimes hummus, mango sorbet, rosehip or blueberry soup (the no sugar versions, so low calorie). I've been working on reducing the size of my last meal, since most of those calories don't get used for anything. 

Aside from that I drink a lot of water, and I drink about 6-9 cups of tea (a lot, I know) and I also have a slight addiction to artificially sweetened beverages like Pepsi Max, which is something I'm working on. I also take a multivitamin each day to make sure I get most of what I need, but I don't believe I'm really deficient in anything.

I forgot about posting for the last days of February because a ton of life issues happened all at once. I'm back now. Things aren't looking up yet but it'll get there.

So, for February:

1400 a day: 22/28. Most of the ""off"" days were between 1600-1800. Hopefully adjusting my intake a little higher will mitigate this so I don't feel deprived.

Log weight daily: 28/28. I've never weighed daily before, and I feel like it really helped. Seeing the data points and trends helps keep me on track.

Workout: 7/8. Hoping to hit twice a week this month, we'll see.

Drink more water: 25/28. Finally in the habit of drinking enough, so I'm dropping this one for March. I'll still be keeping up with it, of course. Less headaches.

Classwork: 24/28. I've never been so on top of things. Posting almost every day reminds me to do it even when I don't feel like it.

Finish a book: No :( I was only 2 chapters away at 241/288 pages. I'm getting it done tomorrow, though. *The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down* is a depressing read and I didn't have it in me to finish it after the weekend I dealt with. Despite this, yes, I enjoyed the book.

What IS real is that as you get smaller, your body uses less calories to function. It takes less energy to carry around and run fewer pounds. So as a person loses weight, their maintenance calories will go down.

I think it's important to make some distinctions, because ultimately there are a lot of factors that go into our metabolisms. It's not as simple as someone ate x deficit for y amount of time and now that's their new maintenance.

The first and simplest is losing weight lowers metabolism, there's simply less tissue to metabolically support. Even body fat uses some calories every day. The first complexity concerns muscle tissue though. Muscle is more metabolically active. Someone with a higher muscle % has a greater metabolism at the same weight as someone with a higher body fat %. When we lose weight we typically lose some muscle, especially if we're not working to maintain it and if we for instance lose weight too quickly. That can lead to someone having a lower maintenance than their weight would otherwise average. The other big complexity has to do with how the body responds to a deficit. The body will take steps to reduce what it's using, essentially lowering metabolism. This can present in several ways like the body running colder and lower NEAT activity - basically everything we do that's unconscious activity.

> When you lose weight you lose tissue, and you become lighter so easier to move around ‚Äì both of these factors result in a reduction in energy requirements. This makes immediate sense, a 60kg person requires fewer calories per day than a 100kg person assuming similar activity levels, and so the fact that their calorie needs reduced after 25% weight loss should come as no surprise. Not only that, but these individuals will be lethargic thus move less, and so their TDEE will of course go down somewhat.
> 
> 35% of the reduction to basal metabolic rate, however, (equal to around 180kcal per day) was not associated with reductions in lean body mass or fat mass, and because we‚Äôre looking at BMR that means that activity isn‚Äôt relevant here either (1). In short, 35% of the reduction in BMR (which represented roughly a 15% reduction overall) was not explained by lost tissue, this was adaptation. 
> 
> Metabolic adaptation, therefore, is the reduction in basal metabolic rate seen in individuals who are losing or who have lost weight, that is not explained by their lost tissue ‚Äì and make no mistake tissue will be lost. During weight loss approaches fat, muscle, and a surprising amount of highly energy expensive organ mass will be lost (1), all of which are metabolically expensive. In one study, for example (2) masses of heart, liver, and kidney decreased by 8, 4, and 6%, whereas skeletal muscle (i.e., a low‚Äêmetabolic rate organ) only decreased by 3%, with these changes making up 60% of the change in resting energy expenditure pre to post diet due to how much energy each tissue type requires. On top of this you of course experience muscle loss and then what is left over is your metabolic adaptation.
> 
> In short metabolic adaptation is not just the difference between your total daily energy needs pre and post diet, it is the difference between your basal metabolic rate after the diet, and the basal metabolic rate that would be expected in someone of your height, weight, and body composition (including organ mass).

There would have been no conceivable reason for ancestral humans to avoid them.

But if you haven't found a diet that aligns your energy intake with output instinctively, without a lot of calorie counting and portion limiting and conscious mental discipline, then guess what?

I also think some people feel better eating different ways or have seen their best results eating a way, but bc they find they feel best on that certain diet they tend to get very dogmatic about that particular diet and take on a limited view of how they think others *should* eat based on their anecdotal success eating that way. 

I was a strict vegan for 5 years, tried keto, carnivore. I was my heaviest and unhealthiest vegan. Keto I was definitely lean & it made me feel pretty good up until a few months into it where it just felt like I needed a bit more carbs. And carnivore made me feel absolutely terrible digestively. Pros to doing restrictive diets for me has been that I figure out what food actually make me feel good and which ones cause a reaction. I found I can‚Äôt have gluten and that high carb diets just fuck with me too much & cause acne, endo flare ups, bloating etc. So I avoid or monitor those. But also, the restriction that comes with the titles ‚Äúketo‚Äù or ‚Äúcarnivore‚Äù aren‚Äôt psychologically sustainable for me either and aren‚Äôt diets I can see me eating forever.

If the way you‚Äôre eating isn‚Äôt as mentally sustainable as it is physically sustainable, you can guarantee dissatisfaction and to hop on more extreme diets in the future which is the easy thing to do. The hard thing to (but imo most sustainable thing for *most*) do is too go back to balance, awareness & portion sizes. Not restricting entire food groups but also listening to their body. Sometimes it looks like finishing a whole plate and eating seconds and sometimes it looks like taking a bite of a meal realizing you‚Äôre not actually hungry and saving the rest for later.

The chance of gaining it all (and more) back after that is smaller than when you crash diet. If you keep your diet high protein and you lift heavy the muscles shouldn't be an issue.

t4uu90,hz17f21,t3_t4uu90,"Depending on what you do specifically you could realistically hit 30 pounds in about 3 to 5 months (you'll probably notice a VERY sharp drop for the first few weeks if you stay locked onto a diet but it'll start to even out after some time, I lost 5 pounds or so a week for about two or three weeks when I first started, then it went down to about 3 pounds and slowly dipped moreso, I'm currently down 12 pounds since the start of the year for reference). As long as you're paying attention to your body's health you'll be fine, and don't go ham at the start. For reference, my calorie intake is 1550 daily and before it was waaaay higher, like probably 4000 calories or something stupid so the sharp drop makes a bit more sense.

Without going into a giant post about it, tracking your calories like a hawk will help immensely, get yourself a calorie tracking app, a digital food and weight scale, and a decent notebook to write notes about your routines, diet, etc, and you'll be on your way to your goal weight in no time. As for loose skin, you need to lose like 100 pounds before that becomes an issue, and even then you'll want to wait like 6 to 10 months before considering surgery. If anything the big worry might be muscle degradation so making sure you're still working out will help out immensely.

First thing to consider is what you‚Äôre eating. If there‚Äôs one thing I learned in my weight loss journey it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet. You don‚Äôt have to restrict your caloric intake but you should be more selective of what you eat. In my case, I followed a strict no sugar, no grains diet and it was very hard at first but once you get in the habit, it just gets easier. I essentially cut out all bread, pastas and rice and certain carby vegetables like potatoes. All you‚Äôre left with is meat and vegetables and there are plenty of combinations of those so it doesn‚Äôt get boring. 
Sugar is a lot harder to cut because it‚Äôs in everything as an added ingredient. Best to save the sweets for a weekend treat. 

Changing the way you eat is hard, NGL. You may very well say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give up pasta‚Äù and that‚Äôs fine. I can evangelize a ketogenic lifestyle and show you my weight charts and progress pictures all day but you ultimately have to find what works best for you because every body is different. 

As for exercise, you might consider body weight exercises which you can do at home if social situations are a concern. A key aspect is zone 2 training (keep your heart rate within a certain range, zone 2 being the ‚Äúfat burning‚Äù zone). The easiest way to maintain this heart rate is walking, which is also one of the best and most underrated exercises you can do. Yoga is good for this too. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like yoga but holy crap I love it. 

It‚Äôs best to start slow with your exercise regiment so that you can build that habit.

I do stretches every morning but definitely will look more into yoga! 
For the 4 months part , basically I‚Äôm in welding school and a single teen mom I went into a deep depression due to stress (I had to leave my house at 6am and would rarely come back before 5 pm then feed my child quickly, a bath for the kiddo , a shower for me , bed time for the kiddo and I had maybe 30 minutes to myself everyday to clean up my place and then go to bed)  it was very stressful. The depression quickly turned to a burn out and I would explose in tears everyday ,people noticed even though I tried to hide it and my teachers talked to the therapist at school. they all decided to force a break from school on me. I will only be able to come back when the group that started 4 months after my group will be at the same place I was.

 In the end, though, the vast majority of people don‚Äôt need macro spreadsheets for their eating habits. Eating moderately and diversely is all that anyone needs to do for healthy nutrition. If you gain weight that adversely affects you, then yes CICO is how you lose it.

I caution against prescribing any hard absolute like ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt protein load, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for failure‚Äù or ‚Äúexercise doesn‚Äôt burn enough calories to make a big impact your calorie deficit‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going against human nature by losing weight‚Äù because every person is different.

I also hate eating the same thing repeatedly in a row, so I freeze portins and individual meals for future days, which ensures a rotating stock of varied meals at my fingertips.  

For intentional healthy eating and weight loss, I meal plan in advance, and put the meals into the calorie counter app to plan my calories for the day, which saves me time and stress in the moment, and does not allow me to get lazy and have fruit loops for dinner.

Potatoes and carrots are a great base for all kinds of different soups and stews. By switching up the protein and spices you have almost unlimited flavor combinations. And you can add in other things based on taste or what's on hand. If you've had a whole chicken, or even just bone in pieces throw leftovers in a pot and you can turn it into  delicious soup.

Stir-fries are awesome and as with soups and stews have tons of varieties. There are lots of good frozen veggie mixes for even more convenience.

I like the idea of 1 container per meal for saving time, but I share a fridge and have basically no space if I were to divide up my food like that, so it's one container per item.

I use the ""Meals"" feature in MFP to record 1 serving of an entree.

When I'm actually planning out my meals I enter in a sample meal in a future day and plan out what foods to eat until the macros are about right. The weighing of individual ingredients is the hardest part because I memorize different measurements, get something cooking, and then jot down the notes.

Welp, ""luckily"" for me, my drinking got so bad that something gave. I knew I couldn't keep it up anymore, or else I was in for a world of hurt. I cut out drinking last summer. A couple of months later, my partner followed suit, so we were both sober. I think it sort of woke him up, because he wanted to go a step further and get serious about losing weight. 

I had to hop on board. There was no way I was going to do *anything* to impede him in his goal, he is morbidly obese. We're both in our 30s, we both need to get our shit together. It's now or never. So I began dieting along with him, of course we both have to do it differently but we're both on the same journey. I am doing it for myself, but I'm also doing it for him and for us as a team. He's lost so much already and so have I. The momentum is good.

He often tells me that he wouldn't have been able to do it without me, but it's only half of it. I wouldn't have even *thought* about losing weight if it wasn't for him. I led the charge when it came to getting sober, he's leading the charge on weight loss. We're both helping each other and supporting each other.

Extremely low carb isn't sustainable for me personally; I've lost quite a bit of weight and eaten quite a bit of carbs along the way; I prefer to eat the way I will at maintenance, that way I don't have to keep cycling between ""being on a diet"" versus... well, not being on a diet, I suppose.

As for ""doing something wrong"" if you're anything like me, you probably bought into the myth that girls don't need to do strength training.  Turns out that was bull\*\*\*\* and we absolutely, positively need to do resistance training to keep our lean tissue to fat tissue ratios in check.

Specifically, you'll want to focus more on the ""hypertrophy"" style of training (get big muscle) moreso than the raw strength training.   That means doing weights at closer to 70 % of the absolute maximum you could lift, for more reps and sets, as opposed to just lifting one heavy thing once every five minutes.

In practical terms, those 1 hour gym sessions should have you play around with weights, machines, etc and see where you land.  Leg press at 100 lbs can barely move?  Try it at 70 lbs and see if you can get 8 reps in.  Take a break, and do it another 3-4 times.  That's the sweet spot for getting more lean tissue.

If it *hurts* then your weight is too heavy.... back off a little bit.  If it's too easy and you could go for another 10 reps, then add a bit more weight.

Don't worry about getting ""bulky.""  Us short gals would need to inject illegal steroids for years for that to happen.

Add in the fact that you are of shorter stature and would need to reduce your calories to a very low number for quick weigh loss. 

This is a lifestyle change that you want to sustain, and your present goals sound unsustainable. If you‚Äôre used to eating 2000 calories, going down to 1400 is going to feel very bad. If you add in weight training and other exercise on top of that, you‚Äôre going to start feeling hangry. If you also cut yourself off from carbs you‚Äôre going to lose that dopamine hit which will make you feel worse, and you‚Äôll lose out on an important component of muscle repair‚Äîcarbs.

A better solution is to find out your TDEE (TDEE calculator.net), and set your activity to sedentary. Unless you are walking and/or lifting all day, the majority of your (and all of our) life/lives are sedentary. Set yourself a goal on the TDEE calculator to lose 1/2 lbs a week (or the metric equivalent of slow weight loss). If it puts you too low, aim for a smaller deficit. You can do a 100-200 calorie deficit and still lose weight. It will be easier and less stressful, but slower. Slower isn‚Äôt worse. Those are the calories you get to work with each day. Try to do mostly meat, fish, tofu, beans and other legumes, and veggies, but don‚Äôt be afraid to have some whole grains in different forms (especially after workouts). Quinoa is loaded with protein, and will not be digested abs processed in the same way that white rice is.  Learn more about low-glycemic grains. They will be your friends. 

Absolutely start lifting weights. They will increase your muscle mass, help you lose weight and recomp, give you shape, and increase your metabolism so that you will eventually be able to eat more food. Losing weight without building muscle decreases your metabolism because you will lose muscle as well as fat. Unless you want to eat less forever, building muscle is essential.

Be forewarned, you will gain a few lbs of water weight when you start lifting and it will take 4-6 weeks for that water weight to even out. It is not fat as long as you are in even a slight calorie deficit. Your weight will go up and down daily. Don‚Äôt worry about that‚Äîit‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôre looking for a month over month downward trend, but that may not show up on the scale much of you are gaining muscle. Take measurements and photos so you can compare. I didn‚Äôt do that initially and it messed with my mind. Once I had measurements, it was easier to ‚Äúsee‚Äù what I couldn‚Äôt see in the mirror. I lost 10 inches all over, but felt like I looked the same. If I didn‚Äôt have proof, I would still be spiraling. At this point I‚Äôve lost 6 lbs, but lost 11 inches. Just now at 5 months in I‚Äôm really starting to see physical changes I can really notice. Lots of definition and new muscles showing. I went down a second cup size in bras and lost 2 inches to the circumference, I had to buy a smaller swimsuit‚Ä¶

Doing slow weight loss and recomp is not as immediately satisfying as doing a quick cut with a steep deficit, but it‚Äôs setting you up for a lifestyle you can maintain and enjoy. Even though it starts slow, once you hit that sweet spot several months in, the changes start happening quickly. It took me 4.5 months to lift 100k pounds, now I‚Äôve done 53k in two weeks time.

I wouldn't worry about being weak right now, just be concerned with slowly getting stronger and doing sets of say 5-15 reps involving a lot of struggle on the final rep.  Muscle will follow.

t4adho,hyybdst,t3_t4adho,"It sounds like you're very motivated right now.  Use that to start making some incremental, lifelong habit changes.  Don't bite off an extreme workout or nutrition plan that you can't maintain for your life.  You want to be focused on permanent changes for your health which will also lead to weight loss over time.  Extreme approaches are very likely to lead to burnout and rebound.  So what does that mean?

In terms of nutrition, focus on reducing sugars, processed foods, and alcohol.  Use oils and fats in moderation, same even goes for healthy fats like nut butter and avocado - they add up REALLY fast calorie-wise - careful with portion sizes, but don't eliminate fat as it's quite satiating.  Focus on INCREASING intake of fibrous foods like legumes and vegetables, and swap refined carbs for whole food carbs wherever you can.  These changes will ultimately help you feel more full after meals and lead to less snacking.

Training-wise, get on a strength-training plan that focuses on ""compound"" (multi-joint) movements that are functional in nature.  Pushing, pulling, squatting, lunging, etc.  Start with bodyweight if that's all you can manage, and there are also lots of varaints of those movements that are easier if full bodyweight is too hard (for example full bodyweight pullups and pushups are likely to be much to hard at this stage, but there are alternatives).  Given limited time, skip ""isolation"" movements like bicep curls, lateral raises, etc., and spend your time on ""compound"" movements.  You want to be activating as many muscle groups as possible to increase your overall strength and metabolism.

After making some of those changes, you have the option to start counting calories more carefully.  If you choose to do that, begin with a small caloric deficit (say 300-600 calories below your TDEE) and see how that goes.  Adjust from there.  You don't really want to be losing more than 1% of your body weight per week.

What my therapist recommended that I found really helpful, was to pursue exercise and diet with the goal of finding happiness, not weight loss. I got really, really into cooking, which made me happy but also made my meals more healthy. Then I started going to the gym for its positive effect on my mental health. I started by just going a couple times a week, but it made me feel so happy that I started going 4 times a week for about 90 minutes each session.

\-Get a smaller container. I bought a couple ramekin-sized cups and started using those instead of bowls. The snacks weren't much better, but there was far less of them. Also, the inconvenience of having to get up and walk downstairs for more kept me from refilling.  Eventually, I realized I wasn't even finishing a whole ramekin anymore. 

\-Replace the unhealthy snacks with healthier ones. This one sounds absolutely nuts, but I realized that the SENSATION of snacking was what really mattered. Which is to say that I was just as content to eat a bunch of carrots or a couple salty olives as I was Doritos. Once I realized this, it was downhill from there. I could also do the same with slices of apple, pears, etc.

It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs relaxing. It‚Äôs a way to celebrate the end of another day. On weekends, it‚Äôs a social thing with my husband. Plus, I sleep better when I‚Äôm not hungry. 

What I did have to change, though, was the idea that I could possibly eat ‚Äúthose‚Äù foods to satiety. You know the ones I‚Äôm talking about.... Highly processed foods. Nutrient empty foods. Low or no fiber foods. Candy, especially, can be eaten in huge caloric volumes without making much of a dent in my stomach/appetite.

I actually don‚Äôt generally measure out portions. The act of portioning out a tiny amount of highly palatable food triggers my binge monster.

* Make it impossible. Don't buy snacks if you don't want to eat them. We are doing groceries once a week which means that I have to make the hard choice only once in the whole week. We also do IF, which means that we don't eat anything after a certain time. This makes it so much easier. The problem before was that I would see the snacks, and want to eat a bit. But of course, I would end up eating way more than that. And that's not because of a lack of willpower or anything. It's simply the way our brains work. You eat a little bit, this releases dopamine, which your brain loves and you want to eat more of it.  It is even the case that you release dopamine by sight or smell. So making it ""impossible"" is one of the best ways to break habits.
* A shift in mindset. What is it that you are actually enjoying, is it the snacks or is it the quality time with your kids. And do you want that your loved ones grow the same habits that you are trying to avoid?
* Accountability. It's tuff to stick through the desired change. Most of us fail in breaking or making habits after a week or two. There is no one to hold us accountable, and in a situation like yours while you want to cut back on snacks your family might be eating them in front of you.

It indeed can be hard to maintain your weight or lose 20 pounds more after a year in. As you said it's all about calories in and calories out. If you are having a hard time cutting the calories you eat, you can manage the amount your burn. You can try to work out more often or do different types of workouts.  For example, you can go a day to the gym and burn around 150 - 200 kc in an hour, or you can do an intense HIIT workout and burn 300 in half an hour.  


You can also do long fasts like 20/4 which will accelerate weight loss as well.

It looks like a lot of different things! but the thing that's been easiest for me for dinners is to always have some kind of high protein meat substitute on hand so I don't have to reinvent the wheel with recipes, and then I lean into quantity (which is massive for satiety - protein is so fucking filling so if the bulk of your calories are coming from something high protein, you're going to be very full)   


I really like the Impossible Chicken nugs, Beyond Beef, there are these little chicken substitutes in the frozen section called Quorn and they are really high protein and low calorie shockingly (egg white based). I am really lazy so a typical evening meal would be a ""bowl"" with a green salad mix, some rice, sweet potatoes sliced up and airfried, some cheese type thing, ""meat"" and then something to make the salad sexy  - like a lil corn chip crumbled and salsa to make it like a south western bowl. or a pecan and dried cranberry with feta or goat cheese with a vinaigrette. I steal a lot of recipes from Sweet Green   


I def lean into cheeses and dairy for a little protein. i do usually eat a 2good yogurt or a protein shake everyday too.

It seems like those who I know that have busy days like yourself tend to do it in the AM, at lunch or later in the evenings!  


One thing that can be helpful (tho tedious) is to make a little schedule of your week as you currently spend your time work with work and obligations, and as you see little breaks - throw a lil walk in, it'll likely be different each day but seriously - even 20 minutes is WAY better than nothing",1,0,0,False,False,True,1646245487.0

You wanna get yourself sweating and your heart rate up - there are apps that u can download that will basically track your heart rate and tell you if you need to be going a little harder.   


The apps are very helpful for increasing intensity in a tangible and productive way. They gamify getting your heart rate up so it's more motivating that ""working harder"" because instead, you're trying to get a lil point and that point gives u a hit of dopamine and the workout can be more satisfying",2,0,0,False,False,True,1646246204.0

t3d91n,hyvqsvp,t1_hyv9vls,"I'll chime in as well and agree with TrigPiggy. It's about consistency. Far too many times I'd be losing fine, have one slip up and throw in the towel without even realising. One bad day doesn't undo the weeks/months/years of hard work you've put in getting to that point. If you fuck up, pick yourself back up and carry on. 

If you're 6'2 and 420lbs you will drop weight at an unbelievable rate for probably the first 3 months (depending on how much of a deficit you put yourself in). It's completely reasonable to drop probably 70lbs within 3 months if you're eating about 2,000 per day, however not many would advise to do that on this sub. When I first started I wasn't going to the gym and was eating under 2k a day (closer to 1600) at around 385. Was 350 inside a month, fell off track but maintained that weight, then when I started back up I was about 320 within another month of going at it.

If I was doing it all over again, I'd join the gym immediately and lift weights, probably stick to a more reasonable calorie intake, although my priority was getting the weight off as fast as I could. If you're in no rush then definitely take the time to do it more slowly and use your size to your advantage. You'll be able to build a lot more muscle on a slight deficit than a lot of people do when they're at maintainance just due to the amount of calories needed.

Going to the gym (and dieting, to an extent) is working out the mind just as much as the body. Your discipline, mentality, motivation and hard work is what's required. Doing those and sticking to a routine especially if you don't enjoy it will make you stronger as a person. Don't think you need to be in there all day either. I'm in there within 45mins to an hour at the most usually.

High protein, high fibre if possible, high volume, low calorie meals. That's what you'll want to focus on regardless of whether you hit the gym or not. Those are likely to keep you satiated for longer and feeling fuller. Nobody is eating 5k calories of chicken breast a day. Stick to the smart sensible choices, find ways to make your favourite foods macro friendly. You'll need to do that for long term success.",5,0,0,False,False,False,1646115249.0

Start now.  Track your calories with an app, everything, a piece of candy?  Track it.  A bag of pretzels?  Track it.  An Apple?  Track it.  After a week or so you will start shedding weight like crazy.

Also, you never know who is working out next to you at the gym.  I see heavy people come in and I want so badly to encourage them, to tell them how welcome it is to see them, to not be self conscious, that the very fact they even came in is an accomplishment.

Phentermine just helps suppress appetite, you still have to make the good choices when you are hungry, you still need to learn proper lifestyle choices etc, and it doesn't last forever (nor should it be taken long-term) either.

To be clear I agree with you *entirely* that the psychological work needs to be done in order to heal the underlying issues around weight gain.

Once I learned that, I was able to finally build and keep habits that are now improving my health in many more ways than just the weight I'm finally seeing drop off after years of failed attempts and yo-yoing.

I would say feeling energized and satisfied are somewhat vague parameters which vary wildly from one person to another and change over time/circumstances. If a person has been unhealthy long enough it's debatable whether they'd even be able to gauge a healthy level of either energy or satisfaction initially. People with BED for instance may struggle to differentiate normal hunger/satiety cues vs their ED urging them to binge.

But what we can know for certain is whether a diet contains enough protein, fat, carbs, vitamins and minerals to keep us healthy, and we can calculate that very accurately on person by person basis. You can lose weight even if you fit a lot of unhealthy food into your diet but your body is going to have something to say about that sooner or later, even if you feel fine.

Anyone who is struggling with their weight to the degree the OP stated they were is likely experiencing disordered eating, and will be susceptible to it in the future without intervention. Suggesting eating anything IIFYM could be immensely harmful to them, which is why I commented.

I do absolutely agree that a Twinkie or other treats now and then are not a problem, I didn't suggest otherwise in my post. I would also say that lots of healthy food tastes as good if not better than a Twinkie does (hello, mango lassi)!! Balance and moderation play a major role in good health.

Some people choose to ""eat back"" exercise calories burned to keep their overall intake higher, and some people just eat the lower amount and pretend the exercise calories don't exist so that they keep a higher deficit.

The best diet is one you will stick with, the changes that you learn to make while losing will help you keep the weight off when you hit your goal.

To get started with CICO look up your tdee, this is an estimate of your daily calories burned based on height,weight,activity level,etc. 3500 calories is 1 pound so to loose I lb/week aim to eat 500 calories under your tdee per day. Dont go too far under, 1-2 lbs per week is generally generally a safe range to aim for. Apps like my fitness pal are great for looking up that calorie content of food. A food scale is also super helpful as it's easy to be way of in your estimates of a portion size.

The fact that you don‚Äôt trust yourself to do this tells me it‚Äôs even more important that you do. Does that make sense? 

The guidance I‚Äôm following is a 2-week maintenance phase for every 12 weeks of deficit. 

For those two weeks, I‚Äôm supposed to immediately bump my average daily calories up to my TDEE. No gradual increase. And I‚Äôm to do that by increasing portion sizes, *not* by adding in foods I‚Äôve not been eating.

For example, I avoid most candy these days, not because it‚Äôs ‚Äúforbidden,‚Äù but because it a) leaves me ravenous and b) throws my macros way off. 

So when I reach the 12-week mark in April, I‚Äôm not going out and celebrating with a gummy bear binge. I can already imagine how sick that would make me feel. Rather, I‚Äôm making a burger with a little more ground beef, or adding an extra tablespoon of olive oil to my homemade salad dressing.

If I struggle to return to my modest deficit after that, oh well. I maintain as long as I need to be ready again.

> I think I need something to work towards

Start on Week 1 here:  **How to get started losing weight:**  https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide

It's foundational. Tracking our intake is what [Charles Duhigg calls a ""keystone habit.""](https://www.google.com/search?q=Charles+Duhigg+keystone+habit)  

> I'm going to fail slowly and miserably. Another part is worried I'll succeed, and blow it again when I find that I'm still unhappy about me.

I fail everyday.  In some way, I fall short of what I intended to happen.   I have failed all the way to goal weight.  I have failed for 6 years as I kept off the weight.  Failing is how we learn to overcome our obstacles and discover the new ones that present themselves.  

We are not able to idle at happier or sadder -- [hedonic adaptation](https://www.google.com/search?q=hedonic+adaptation) comes along and takes whatever mental affect we're in and whatever it looks like from the outside, we feel just like ourselves.  Lottery winners?  Eventually not any happier.  People who have lost loved ones, not any sadder after the grief has passed.  

What we can become is satisfied.  We can, with our daily choices and our mindset, live the good life.  We can endure the hardships because we're harder and smarter than they are.

You're 290 or so and afraid to lose weight because what if it's maybe ....   Dude, you ARE right now 290.  You're in your 40s and your weight puts you in a perilous health classification.  Life was not perfect at 202, but you remember the satisfaction despite the struggles that continued to happen.   

> Another part is worried I'll succeed

At 202 you were not at a mountain top (and maybe you're seeing that there is no mountain top, just a right direction; and that this is true of everything and not just weight and health).  

You will blow it again, but you've learned something.  First, you know this is doable.  Second, you know that taking your eyes off of your health doesn't maintain your health:  maintain is a verb, verbs are action words.   You are entering this battle more knowledgeable than you were the first time.  Forewarned is forearmed.  

This is a life and you have at least one fewer days left than you had yesterday.  Being obese for the next few decades will make that life, if not shorter, a lot harder.  At 290, even stairs are a high tax that we try to avoid.  

You've dug a hole from which you need to crawl out of.  Your choices are to live here, keep digging deeper, or get to work getting out of it.   Only one of these is the right choice, right now.   The past is in the past.   Fear of an uncertain future doesn't keep you from doing the right thing, right now.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646140377.0

It was actually... kind of awesome.

But it didn't make me happier. I still felt like the odd one out, my relationship of the time didn't improve, something still was missing in my head. I knew I'd wind up gaining all the weight back. I was right about that - over the course of the following 15 years, it came back.""

t4d3vl,hyxsm08,t3_t4d3vl,"**How to get started losing weight:**  https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide

Use that to get started.   It should become fairly clear that only calories count for weight loss.   It recommends that you start with your regular, normal food:  do not go out and buy all new 'healthy' foods that are practically foreign to you.   Your first week should be on your regular food and your second week is where you might look for changes to be made in a few -- and only a few -- things.

On to that Nutrition Facts label.  

Example:  https://www.fda.gov/media/134412/download

Notice first **servings** and most packages have more than 1 serving in them.  Servings are somewhat standardized, but people have widely different habits -- some eat 2x the standard serving, especially if they're big.   So if you eat 2x the standard serving, you're going to have to consider that you eat 2x the calories of a standard serving.  

Most of us here have bought a digital kitchen food scale (about $15).  This really helps us measure in grams or in ounces accurately.  It's more accurate than using measuring cups and measuring spoons.  

> then I hear stuff saying that they‚Äôre actually good for you.

Look at that FDA picture in the lower right side and that will give you an idea of what's worth preference and what's not worth preferring.  Both bacon fat and olive oil are fats, but bacon fat is saturated fat and olive oil is not -- and that says to try to hold down the amount of saturated fats we eat.    White bread has nearly 0g fiber and whole-wheat bread has 2g fiber and that section tells us to prefer the kind that has fiber for health reasons.  

Let's start with that.   

What to do:  focus on servings and calories in those servings and how to measure.  

What to prefer:  food grown in agriculture is better than food made in a factory.  They will naturally be better in these areas.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646157383.0

I do intermittent fasting, sounds like you essentially are, in addition to gym and walking, so sounds like we're pretty similar. Cardio in a fasted state I found helped with my weight loss, most days my last meal is 8pm at the latest, and then a cardio session about 7am, usually 40 or 50 minutes on the cross trainer. I then try and extend my fast as long as I can, sometime I eat at lunch, somedays I am OMAD. Strength training generally in the evening, but sometimes at lunch in a fasted state. When I first started in the gym I generally did what you are, just go on the machines, set pattern, at every visit. I then changed to a push/pull/leg regime, which meant I could go to the gym a bit more often, and still get rest for my muscles. I think it has made a difference, and while my routine is fairly fixed that I do, I occasionally mix it up a bit.

I really like walking, and I would suggest if you can try a few longer distances, at our size we can burn a fair few calories on a good walk.

You picked a very good one here.  Yes, I do home workouts and have seen gains across my months.   Which brings up a point:  are you keeping track?   You should be improving on something across the weeks -- using heavier dumbbells, getting further through the videos (if you can't yet complete certain ones), getting more reps across time.   WARNING: Always lift safe -- never push yourself into unsafe ""tired"" moves.  Keep a fitness log of your exercise details and use it to see gradual performance progress across time.  Not of your body, of your workouts.

> She said I could aim for somewhere near 40% muscle

Where is it going to come from? -- it can really only come from your fat.  It's a component (or composition) pie chart where it always totals 100%   So to gain 8.6 percentage on muscle would be to take 8.6 from somewhere else --- is 18% fat realistic?  It is for female athletes but it's two big steps away for someone with 26% fat.     Make a mid-way point of 22.5% bodyfat% which will involve muscle building and no weight loss.   (Techie term for this is recomposition or 'recomp' for short.)

If you want a way to check your bodyfat% at home, take your Relative Fat Mass now -- https://www.google.com/search?q=relative+fat+mass+calculator -- and it probably won't match exactly the body check but it will track the same.  Whatever your RFM is, check it every 2 weeks and work to reduce it by 3.5 for that midway point.    Then recalibrate with another body check scan if you can, and check in again with your endocrinologist to see if it's still a right goal for you.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646138413.0

February wasn't a bad month. It has ups and lows, but overall:

* The average calories were 1500-1600 (very inconsistent unfortunately). 
* I did my workouts - usually 3x/week + some running (2x/week) - some days missed because we had 3 storms in 1week. 
* NSV: people actually noticed my weight loss without me mentioning anything. So it is visible!

Goal setting for March:

* I want to lose 1kg.
* Progress with heavier kettlebells.
* Stick to my 3workouts/week + be consistent with 2x running/week. 
* Restart YWA program. I really miss yoga ...
* At least 7000steps/day. No more days with 200steps!
* Be consistent with diet. I think I need to start planning more in range 1400-1500. On one hand, because less than that leaves me hangry and on the other hand, because I'm getting close to my a stable weight.
* Keep up going physically to my language lessons. It forces me to try to speak in a new language + I move a bit out of the house.

Rowing on the day I wasn't eating as well, and typically going all out the whole time. So it was 30 minutes of high intensity, from a big guy, I'd guess 400KCal would be reasonable. 

On top of rowing I also walked 10K steps a day, and incorporated some kettlebell training after a few months.

I'd warm up with jump rope for 5-10 minutes. I picked jump rope because when I boxed in college I was bad at it, so I wanted to get better.

Don't use any calculation to derive what you should eat. Instead do it based on observation. Track your food as carefully as you can, and track your weight 2-3 weeks.

If your weight is within natural water variance what you tracked as your food intake is your maintenance. From there subtract calories to get to the rate of loss you want.

Note: If you've not previously tracked calories, this act alone might cause weight loss as you start to become aware of how much you're eating. Which cool! but be prepared to use tracking and observation to find your maintenance as you exit your loss phase.

Why: People, even with scales and Apps are bad at measuring (myself included!) and TDEE calculators are not individualized. You will have margin of error based on your measuring mistakes, and your personal genetics for metabolism that might make you think you're eating in a deficit and you're not, or vice-versa.

t3hdv7,hyv7hwp,t3_t3hdv7,"800 calories is a definite no-go. A body that doesn‚Äôt move all day needs at least 1,300 calories to function properly, but nobody doesn‚Äôt move a single muscle all day long. 
3,000 calories on the other hand, is definitely too high for a weight loss goal. My suspicion is that those calories are composed of mostly ultra-processed foods. Ultra-processes foods are very energy dense without having a lot of weight (literally) to them. Think of how light a McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburger is, or a couple of eggos waffles, compared to a hefty bowl of chia pudding or a chicken wrap. I think the most important thing you could do to see results would be to start eating more whole, natural foods that are dense with nutrients and also make you feel fuller. (Think of that super old picture where 400 calories of ____ doesn‚Äôt fill your stomach as much as 400 calories of broccoli, or something similar.) You definitely don‚Äôt have to calorie count- especially if your diet overall is filled with healthier components. 

Something in my relationship that helps us eat healthier, is we split a Hello Fresh subscription. It takes away my least favorite part of cooking (grocery shopping) and provides an easy way for us to make healthy food for each other :) It can also be a fun thing to do for each other! Assign one day each out of the week where you cook for each other instead of ordering out! It‚Äôll keep those costs and ultra-processed foods down! 

That adapted diet, paired with some exercise like walking/hiking, jogging, or biking will work well!

I'm 4'10"" so even shorter than you and back in 2017 when I started my CICO journey I weighed 141.1 lbs. From the start and still, after almost 5 years, I still stick to 1200 calories a day and today I weigh 117.7 lbs so I've lost 23.4 lbs (and still losing...)

So, 800 calories a day is too little and you should eat and will lose weight by eating 1200 a day. I recommend checking out tdee calculator so you'll know your daily maintenance calories (mine is currently 1360 cals a day, with light exercise about 1500 so either way, with 1200 I will lose weight).

If you haven't done calorie counting yet, I highly recommend it. I use LoseIt! app and it's been a life saver keeping me sane 'cos those 1200 cals are not a lot and they are spent so fast if you don't think about what you're putting in your mouth...The app helps me plan my eatings and helping making batter choices by showing me how my macros (fat, proteins, carbs etc.) are distributed. To me, 1200 is enough in a day, I don't feel like I'm starving or malnourished etc. At first it felt so wrong 'cos I was used to eat over 2000 calories a day but now, after four years (and a couple of re-gains) later, CICO has stuck on me, and 1200 is normal, everyday life :) like they say, every diet there is is based on eating on a deficit = calories in, calories out.

If I do exercise and that includes light walking, I definitely eat more than 1200 of course. I also don't panic if I eat say 1400 or even 1500, since I'm pretty sure my maintenance is 2000 (164cm, 75.9kgs at the moment - started at 95kg). 

I was maybe an outlier in terms of how I gained weight - for me it was almost all from alcohol consumption. Beer, specifically. Lots and lots of beer. The weight started coming off once I quit drinking and I also stopped ordering takeaway food. Started going for more walks just as a natural side effect of no longer being constantly drunk or hungover. The kinds of food I eat haven't changed dramatically.

Cutting alcohol and takeaways definitely had the biggest impact on my weight loss and so far I haven't felt the need to go too much further yet as I'm still losing weight pretty steadily.

After trying to make healthy choices for a while, then consider downloading a calorie tracking app and seeing where you stand. You can set a **reasonable** calorie goal and try to eat around there. I would focus on eating healthier meals and chilling on the snacking first though. 

And next time you go grocery shopping, buy less of the junk snacks. I would still buy your favorite unhealthy snack, it‚Äôs ok to still enjoy the things you love, but think critically about which food actually makes you feel good and happy and which foods you‚Äôre just eating because you‚Äôre bored or it‚Äôs there. There‚Äôs no need to eat healthy foods that make you unhappy either. Just try a few things and see which healthy foods you like.

When I calculated the calories in my cheesecake recipe, I was shocked to see that one piece (one twelfth of a cake) was 908 calories. I brought it to a party and took home the leftovers, so I ended up eating it for five days in a row. That's a week when I didn't lose any weight! That's a huge chunk of the 1400 calories a day I'm trying to limit myself to. Have one dessert a day if you really need to. But account for it by limiting calories elsewhere, by having zero-calorie drinks or only a small amount of crisps. If you have two desserts in a day, make each one half the size you'd normally eat. If you have three, make them one-third the normal size. Look into zero-calorie liquid stevia to sweeten drinks and foods.

A TDEE calculator says your TDEE is 1725 calories a day (I put your age at 25, so this could be off, and it's only an estimate at best). That means that anything below that will make you lose weight: 500 below that (1225) will lose a pound a week, 250 below that (1475) will lose half a pound a week. I wouldn't try to lose too fast.

However, our bodies don't just need calories, they also need nutrients.  

Calories are the energy that powers the body's motors (muscles and muscular organs, like the heart).  The body stores excess calories in bodyfat.  When we have a caloric deficit, the body takes from this bodyfat to fill in the missing calories.

Nutrients are the enzymes, fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins that enable the organs to work and the various systems to work together: endocrine, immune, integumentary (hair, skin, nails), digestive, renal, nervous systems, etc..    Unlike calories and bodyfat, the body does not store many nutrients long term.   We get most of our nutrients from the foods that we are presently eating.

Eating disorders are beyond you. They're beyond this sub, too, for that matter; I'd tell her the same thing if it was her posting instead of you.

>She hates that in order to lose weight, she will need to live her life counting calories, restricting herself and toying the line with her eating disorder.

The body image issues aside, this bit right here is why she needs to get in with a therapist, preferably one who specializes in eating disorders, as well as possibly a dietician. Counting calories can be extremely triggering for people with eating disorders. There are ways to go about losing weight that don't involve counting calories; it's potentially a longer process, and quite frankly, she's going to need professional help to deal with that aspect of it as well.

If you're in the US, go to www.psychologytoday.com and use the Find A Therapist search feature. Again, you're looking for one who specializes in eating disorders.

It's okay to have a goal weight, but setting a time limit on it is a recipe for disaster. If you're anything like me, then if you have a blip or fall off the wagon, or your journey takes you longer than you'd hoped, or you realise you aren't losing those 5 pounds per month and therefore aren't on track to meet your goal 'on time', it'll just send you into a spiral of feeling like a failure and you'll end up giving up completely or over-eating again because 'what's the point now that I'm definitely not going to meet my goal'.

It's okay to set a weight goal but I would advise you not to tie it to a specific date.

Something I struggled with for years was always knowing I was physically capable of losing the weight, but was never able to actually do so. It took me breaking some mental barriers but I eventually got on the right track and am working now on forgiving myself and getting over the regrets I have. I genuinely think the only way to succeed in getting the weight off and KEEPING it off is to forgive yourself. Don‚Äôt live with regret. If you have to justify to yourself that it was a learning period (which I have done) then do that- but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. The past is in the past, enjoy your wedding! You deserve it. Try not to let yourself feel guilty. Be proud of yourself for getting to this mental place, it takes a lot more effort than you realize. This might just be me, but I found that the mental hurdles were 10x more challenging than the physical ones. The good thing about that is that it gets easier day by day, the more you engage in healthy behavior the better you feel and the more motivated you feel to stay on track. Just as importantly though-don‚Äôt get down on yourself for having setbacks. Don‚Äôt even consider them setbacks! It‚Äôs a huge undertaking to reverse habits that keep us unhealthy. Just consider them mental hurdles that you have to get over-and you can because you already have! If you get to April 22 and you‚Äôre not at your goal weight (I have every faith you can get there though by the way) don‚Äôt get down on yourself. Embrace the successes you had and keep going.

Be careful not to ""race for the bottom"" leaving you on a diet of a teaspoon of chicken breast sprinkled with broccoli dust.   It's important to eat enough.  Food isn't just our energy (which can be replaced by our bodyfat), it's also our nutrition (most all of which comes from the food we eat each week).  We have to eat enough food and it must be varied to cover all of the nutrients in sufficient amounts.

It appears that 2228 is your Calorie goal (which is fine as I put your TDEE at about 2698 before exercise).  But you are not hitting your goal, you're coming in at more than 500 under it and you're asking for a list of the least caloric foods.  

Actually right now, 2228 minus 500 more is about 1 kg per week worth of loss -- but you really don't want to go faster than that for these reasons.

Can I suggest, instead, that you partially stick to the foods that already define your life -- your favorite meals and traditions -- and use this new skill to learn how to properly portion THOSE, and how to prepare THOSE in a less caloric way.  

These adjusted recipes and portions are the long-term skills you're going to need to keep off that weight after reaching goal weight.  

> orzo is half the calories by weight vs other pasta!? What‚Äôs that about? So I had that for lunch today and will have it again as it satisfies my pasta cravings and is half the calories. 

Orzo here (USA) is, gram for gram, the same as any other pasta.  Here it is just a different cut.   I wonder if it's different where you are?

If you're cool with USA cooking sites, take a look at

Whether it is full body or a bro split at this point is up to whatever you think sounds more fun, though you may want to consider that you will be very sore at first and a split will give you longer recovery periods before hitting the same muscle groups again (this won't really matter after a few weeks but may make a difference for your program adherence at first). 

3. The most important thing is to pick a number of days per week that you can commit to weight training and Stick. To.

Basically, I came across a build-your-own-workout structure that looked something like this:  
  
1. Warm up: 5 to 10 minutes of cardio. I jog or go on the stationary bike.  
  
2. Plyo + core: Alternate between a plyometrics exercise and a core exercise. 10 to 15 reps, 3 sets each. Yesterday I did squat jumps and crunches. So to be clear, 10 squat jumps, 10 crunches, repeat two more times. I do this on day 1 and 3. On day 2 I'm supposed to do burpees and sit ups, but burpees are the worst, so I usually do squat jumps again and sit ups.  
  
3. Upper body + lower body: Pair an arms/chest/back exercise with a legs/glutes exercise. Same as above, 10 to 15 reps, 3 sets each. I do this 3 times, with different exercises each time. You can increase weights as the exercise starts to feel easier. You should be able to do at least 10 reps with your weight choice but 15 should be a struggle. You can also add exercises, up to 5 exercises for each half of the body.  
  
I choose my exercises based on what I like to do, but I try to prioritize compound exercises and alternate between push/pull for upper body. I change it up every month or two. Right now I do squats and chest press, lunges and upright rows, and deadlifts and lat pulldowns on days 1 and 3. On days 2 I do sumo squats and shoulder press, step ups and chair dips, and hip thrusts and lat pulldowns.

I eat snacks in the afternoon and chocolate every day - I follow CICO and macro targets, and I fit that stuff into my food budget.

Don't worry about exercising ""as much as you can every day"" - you can't outrun your fork.  Exercise has a *ton* of benefits, but weight loss isn't necessarily one of them!

Instead, pick an exercise you like to do, and set a goal to do it a few times a week.  It can be something as simple as walking for 30 minutes.

You simply aren't going to be full enough from the carb heavy and sugar heavy diet most Americans partake in to refrain from overeating.  

Do you need to only eat chicken and broccoli? No.

But the thought that you'll eat the exact same type of diet that you gained weight on, and will only need to ""eat less"", is ignoring the science.

People eat what tastes  good, namely sugars, carbs, fats, and salts. Sugars and carbs have a waaaay lower satiation factor than vegetables and proteins.

The fact is that our clever brains are very happy to concoct every excuse under the sun to keep us eating the very same nutritionally dense, hyper-palatable food that got us fat in the first place.  The idea that restriction leads to binging is just false.  A binge episode is a sign of a stronger addiction than you realized.

Many people have the unhealthy belief that they *need* some food in order to live.  That is the behavior that must be undone, and one straightforward antidote is to forever eliminate the offending food.  Tarring this as ‚Äúover-restriction‚Äù is demoralizing and destructive and continues to promote toxic addiction cycles.

t2rzqb,hyp0spw,t3_t2rzqb,"While I hear you loud and clear I personally say no. For me, the push for weight loss came when I was speaking to a friend who had lost a lot of weight himself. I begged him to tell me what his ""magical secret"" was. He said that he slowly cut out things (aka basically giving them up for good) that contributed nothing but empty calories. 

He started with soda, simple enough, just get water, tea, or coffee (and watch your creamers/sugar). Then moved up to things like fries on the sides of meals (IE: just ordering a burger, no fries). And slowly from there cut out most fast foods although he does like a burger here or fried chicken there. He started buying bell peppers and fruits to snack on instead of Doritos or something and lost over 100lbs combined with light jogging.  

Cutting out these things slowly, bit by bit, really helped him look at things differently. He said that quote ""If I had drunken the amount of water that I did soda I'd be the worlds most hydrated man""

So for me, and people I know personally, cutting out things like that works. For some people it's too much of a temptation to keep it in your diet so why not cut it out? Lets say you are 100% committed to a new thing where you measure out all of your food and you get a bag of chips or a box of cookies, serving size: 2 cookies/17 chips..*well..thats not a lot.* Before you know it you've eaten half the box/the whole bag.

t2rzqb,hypa9vg,t3_t2rzqb,"> 2. you absolutely cannot control consuming something in excess‚Ä¶ but be aware of your current limitations

Even if you haven‚Äôt successfully developed the virtue of temperance yet, this one can still be ameliorated in many cases if you plan ahead and make some personal commitments.

Ex. If chocolate is the thing you love to treat yourself to as a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù at the end of the week you can commit to only buying 1-to-2 servings worth at a time and **never** allowing yourself to buy any from the store if you already still have some remaining at home. This way it‚Äôs impossible to go too overboard with that food because there won‚Äôt be enough supply available for it to be possible.

Ex. If cookies are your favorite dessert don‚Äôt buy packages or baking mixes from the supermarket. Go to some QSR where cookies are a dessert item and are sold in units of 1 or 2 and leave with just that. If pastries are your thing then go to a bakery where you can buy just one portion instead of buying a tin of cupcakes from the store. 

Ex. If you‚Äôre like me and your favorite thing on earth is pizza, only go to places where you are not obligated to buy a whole pie. _(Ideally a local pizzeria that doesn‚Äôt deliver)_ Just buy two medium or one large slice w/ healthy toppings and don‚Äôt eat it until you get home. If you are tempted to eat more after you finish the slice you can‚Äôt cave and order another helping if you aren‚Äôt even there. 

Ex. If a large amount of a trigger food _(ex. A whole pizza pie, a box of donuts, a big birthday cake, several six-packs of beer/hard seltzer)_ has been ordered by your fam/companions/colleagues & you truly feel that you won‚Äôt be able to resist not having ***any,*** then just sip on some water or a diet soft drink for awhile and tell yourself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll allow myself to have some but I‚Äôll be patient and wait until later.‚Äù Then **procrastinate HARD.** If you‚Äôre the very last person to start partaking then there most likely won‚Äôt be enough left for you to significantly over indulge. BONUS: If you happen to have something healthy & filling to eat with you _(ex. a big green salad )_ then eat that like 10-25 minutes before you begin indulging in whatever treat was ordered. Keeping yourself hydrated and having some food in your stomach already can help you feel satisfied quicker than usual once you **do** eat what was ordered. 


TIP: And one thing that also helps no matter what the food is, is making an obligation to not eat any trigger foods ‚Äúon the go‚Äù any more. For example if you get a reasonable portion of your favorite fast food and begin+finish eating it in your car before arriving at your final destination then it‚Äôs far too easy to make a quick stop at another drive-thru. If you wait till you get to your home or job & get comfortable before eating it and then choose to distract yourself with something else right after you finish eating, it‚Äôs really not gonna be simple to go out and over indulge on more of that trigger food",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646000920.0

* Has an *endocrinologist* diagnosed you with a metabolic disorder, or any kind of disorder that has an affect on your metabolism?

t3hoy0,hyskzhx,t3_t3hoy0,"So I‚Äôm just under 5‚Äô5‚Äù and hit about 240/250 at my largest. My mental health was not great (was in a bad marriage, in a town I hated, and living a life that I hated).I also had so many starts and failures to losing weight. I would have a couple bad days and then say, we‚Äôll I fucked this up again-why bother trying, then eat a dozen donuts or a sleeve or Oreos and wash it down with a couple sodas. 

One day I finally truly decided that I was going to lose the weight and I was going to do it for me! I know that if I try to count calories and things like that I get super overwhelmed and quit,(I get frustrated if I don‚Äôt see the results that I think I‚Äôm supposed to see) so I thought about what my biggest ‚Äúmistake‚Äù was with my food. Sugar/fast food. So I bit the bullet and cold turkey gave up sugar/soda/fast food. First two weeks were hell, sugar withdrawals are no joke, but after that two weeks it got so much easier-and then I didn‚Äôt miss or really like sugar anymore. 

I replaced my soda with (flavored at first) water/coffee (I‚Äôve always been a black coffee drinker), fast food I replaced with all home cooked meals (slow cooker was my best friend), and if I really wanted snacks I found healthy alternatives (frozen pur√©ed bananas are so much like ice cream and just amazing).

I was talking daily walks as they were good for my mental health and my ‚Äúme‚Äù time. I did start jogging as well, but that was further into my journey-about 6 months or so. 

I didn‚Äôt think about it as a diet, it was just the way i ate, to live-and longer just living to eat. The weight just started falling off.

t3hoy0,hysbt2k,t3_t3hoy0,"So I relate to this a lot and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this and for the loss of your Nan. I started with my mental health because I realized that nothing was going to change until I got my depression and anxiety under control. I went on Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs honestly changed my life. I struggled with binge eating for my whole life and now I have it under control and no longer binge. The medication honestly saved my life. There of course is an adjustment period which is rough (check the subreddit for this med for more info!) but that being said after being on it for about a year now, I am no longer depressed, my anxiety is under control, and I no longer have the urge to binge. I‚Äôve lost 20 pounds since May of last year and really only started ‚Äútrying‚Äù to lose weight about 4 months ago. I also changed my mindset because like you mentioned, once you lose and then gain it back, you just want to give up because you feel like you could never lose the weight. My mindset shift when I realized that time keeps ticking one day at a time‚Äî sounds cliche, I know. But the way I look at it now is that if I had started 30 days ago, I would be on day 30 today. Or if I had started 6 months ago, I would be on the journey for 6 months today. So about 4 months ago, I decided to make it my day 1. I didn‚Äôt put pressure on myself to go to the gym and crank out these insane workouts, I just started walking a couple days a week. That + my mental health/binging under control, I have lost weight without changing my day to day drastically but slowly since last May, which has led me to build sustainable habits.

t3hoy0,hyszkj7,t3_t3hoy0,"I have been at this for about a year now and I am 20lbs away from my goal. What I have learned is plateaus are normal and can last from 4-12 weeks. The lower the weight sometimes the longer the plateau. This is why it is incredibly important to not have a ""diet"" mentality. Whatever you are doing shouldn't feel like a contracted work job that will be over as soon as you reach a scale  goal. Creating healthy maintainable habits that will carry you through long plateaus is the key to getting and keeping weight off. 

It took a long time but things that have helped me:

1) Figuring out my natural hunger schedule. I can go all day, eating or not eating, and still be binge style hungry around 5pm. Knowing this I have a routine set up where I hit the gym at 5, after work. Working out is a natural appetite suppressant. I get home at 6:30pm, make dinner, and eat around 7. I get full from a nutrition loaded meal, and it is bed time before the urge to start snacking starts. 

2) Only weighing-in once a month. Ensuring the weigh in is on the same day every month is important, especially if you are female. If you have to weigh in weekly, you should compare the number to last months weight at that time rather than the week prior. This will give you more accurate information.

3) Eating for substance vs eating for pleasure. This one is hard for me to explain, but it was a mental change. I now view the majority of my meals throughout the week as eating for substance. I am still eating things I like, such as eggs, fruit, vegetables, meats, but they are cooked in a healthy manner. Those doughnuts someone brought in Monday morning? That is a pleasure food that is not in my schedule. It is not in my schedule because I want my pleasure food to be this Saturday when I go out to eat. I do treat myself to pleasure food, but it is planned out according to what is going on. This has been the biggest change that has helped me in my diet.

 When I started to view food as substance vs pleasure I really got a good picture of how much pleasure food I was eating. (Which fully explained why I was fat lol)

Sure it's slower, but you're far, far less likely to have hunger attacks and you can slowly change your diet to match the calorie limit

t3hoy0,hyt0w3u,t1_hyspbsh,"My best tips: 

I take 4 fiber pills (they're called psyllium husks) a day, two in the AM and two in the PM. It honestly helps take the edge off that panic hunger you can get while reducing. 

I try to plan out my food each day. I literally take it out of the fridge or set it aside in the freezer/fridge. I add up the calories and ensure that it's where I want it to be. I usually allow some wiggle room because some days I need a snack and some days I don't. 

I try to drink water every time I feel hunger---of any kind. I try to chug a full 8 oz glass of water and wait 10 minutes. If I still feel hungry I can have a high protein low sugar snack like nuts, an egg, cheese, etc.

I try my hardest not to keep trigger foods in the house. 

I have ""go to"" easy options that I can eat every day for weeks that I know and trust. Lunchables, those squeeze smoothies, yoghurt single serves, 100 calorie packs of pretzels, individual peanut butter packs, those ""mini charcuterie board"" packs, string cheese, hard boiled eggs, those veggie with sauce steamer packs, Lean Cuisines, Jello cups, stuff like that. Is it broiled Brussel Sprouts healthy? No. But it works. I switch out new options every few months and mix it up.

When you're first moving away from anything and everything mentality it's often just too hard to go to this ""roasted veggie are SO TASTY"" place. While processed food ultimately is something you want to minimize, one thing at a time. If getting Skinny Cow popsicles helps with a sweet tooth, let it be for now! Goal is to reduce binging and get cravings and emotional eating under control, not be perfect.

My final tip is to eat slowly. Put the fork down literally in between bites. I figured out that many of my supposed fave treats were really bland and not all that great when I paused to actually taste them! Take time to fully taste the flavors and check in ""is this honestly worth the calories? Or could I home-make a better version or sub in something higher quality in a lower amount?""",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646071548.0
t3hoy0,hytb637,t1_hyt6pu7,"Yes, I do track calories using My Fitness Pal. The experience of tracking calories was so important.  It taught me simple changes for huge impact. 

Example: I love tortillas-burritos, wraps, quesadillas ect. Well, flour tortillas are like 150 calories alone. Two wraps are like 300 calories, put some taco meat and cheese and sour cream..it is like all of your calories in one meal. I love tacos way too much to give them up, so I found better options. Instead of flour tortillas I use the carb friendly (45 calories each) instead of loading with regular taco meat I either will use chicken or cook a lighter version with turkey burger. I either skip the cheese or use a light cheese. I load it up with more veggies and salsa. The final meal is two big burritos at 375 calories. 

I found that nearly every meal I love had something I could do to make it healthier and keep what I loved about it. Using MyFitnessPal was key. 

I am at the point where I don't really have to use it, I just like having the extra accountability. Also, I have my Fitbit hooked up to it and its nice seeing the exercise calories there.

1) Calculate your TDEE (Google ""TDEE calculator""), and select ""sedentary"" as the activity level. Subtract 500 to 1000* from the ""maitnainence"" number it gives you, that will be your new calorie goal for the day. (I'd suggest starting with 500 for the first few weeks.)

2) Download MyFitnessPal or another calorie tracking app and input your stats. Start tracking. Track everything, including cooking oil and liquids.

3) Start walking, aim for 30 minutes a day to start. Listen to music, or a podcast, or just take time to think.

Resistance training is awesome but that can come later. Master a walking schedule first and when that becomes second nature to you then start to look into resistance training and more strenuous cardio.

Although if you are in a caloric deficit, eat a fair bit of protein, and do strength training to protect your muscles, then that is the most effective way to make weight loss concentrate on fat loss. Any method of creating that caloric deficit that works with your health is fine, but calorie counting is the most reliable way to ensure a caloric deficit, as long as you use a food scale to weigh your food. Other methods can be fine though if calorie counting is a bad fit for you.

When losing fat there is basically nothing you can do to affect where the fat will be taken from. It will be determined by your genetics and hormones. It can change with age. Theoretically, there is a small extent to which you can affect your hormones, but it's not very practical. About all you can do to try to reduce stomach fat in particular is get good sleep and try to use good coping skills, because stress can encourage belly fat.

It wasn't helping much with my ADHD, so I switched to Adderall which has been much more effective at helping but also for me the appetite suppression isn't too strong, I just don't get cues to eat or drink until I've waited a little too long.

I get around 1600-1800 calories in on good days, recently I've had to start making myself eat because I've been not eating until late in the day and then when I do eat I just don't have the appetite to consume that much food. I do strength training with a kettlebell and steel club everyday, so eventually I'm going to have to address this, so far I'm still building muscle.

I was also recently on Paxil for a period to treat my social anxiety, which it did help with but I also had a slew of side effects including decreased appetite, and it was a little unreal, I pretty much never felt hungry and eating often made me feel nauseous. I'm thankfully off of this medication now.

Meds aren't the sole cause for lowered appetite in my case, sometime in late 2020 something switched in me, and I still have no idea what or why. My appetite slowly started to reduce and food preferences started to change. I rarely weighed myself so it wasn't until July of last year that I realized I had steadily been loosing weight since Dec. 2020. Don't know what changed but my appetite and diet is very different now, I never have strong cravings for specific foods, I don't even crave sweets anymore. Food is also no longer something I use to find comfort in.

I can say that I've been losing 10-20lbs(generally more towards 20) a month for roughly 7 months now and recently had bloodwork plus a checkup done with my primary, and everything was normal.

Don't be afraid of calorie dense foods, I don't explicitly count calories or worry about what I'm eating too much, especially if I haven't eaten all day. Oils, preferably healthy ones, are an easy way to add calories to a meal.

chicken / veg / rice

starting with the rice

* try brown rice, its got extra fibre which is good and texture wise is a bit more ""meaty"" to get into
* add stock cubes to your rice while cooking (if you do a few meals at once can use a whole one - or just chop a bit off when doing single serving
* add hot sauce to the water while cooking - alternative to the above

Chicken

Without knowing what you mean by ""body type,"" with regard to weight, the general advice for putting on muscle is this:

* Exercise: engage in a strength training program. It could be weights. It could be bodyweight. But do something that allow you to gain strength through some form of progressive overload, be it through more reps, more complex movements, more weight, or a mix.

* Diet: you understand the calories, which is how you got to this point. Changing body composition requires a little more attention to macros on top of just CICO. Make sure you're eating enough protein. Studies say that you need roughly 1.6 and 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram on a cut, with somewhat less on a bulk. Personally I go above this, just because it's more filling and I don't get as hungry. And most bodybuilders hit the protein content on a cut by using lean meats.

Walking.  3x a week, 30 minutes each time.  More is always allowed but set a minimum goal that drives you to do it.    This is the perfect activity for starting.   After 30-45 days of your calorie-controlled diet and your walking (a form of cardio exercise), consider adding some resistance training in the form of weightlifting or no-impact (no jumping) calisthenics.   Do delay that for now, though, for a few weeks -- it's important not to start too many things simultaneously.   Build habit changes, don't reboot.

Calories burned is really hard and leaves us with false impressions.

Here's the thing, though.  A lot is made of the fact that the liver changes to metabolizing the alcohol first.  Excesses of energy are stored as fat.  

BUT!!!

CICO is not broken.  Excesses of energy are always stored as fat (even if its merely eventually).  If your body is burning fat at the moment that you drink a drink, it stops burning fat and starts metabolizing the drink.   It will, though, metabolize a drink of vodka before it metabolizes a drink of apple juice but 200 Calories of excess energy is -- at the end of it all, across time -- 200 Calories of excess energy.   

Many of these articles worry about what happens first when alcohol hits the liver.  Indeed, that's interesting.   But across a couple of days, accounting for the various macros and alcohol (alcohol is 7 Calories a gram and not exactly a macro), CICO is still the math.

* Lightly Active (PAL 1.4): you spend most of your waking hours standing up, but not walking around very much - people caring for a small child probably fall into this category; if you work, your job is probably something like cashier, teacher, etc. (If you're a delivery driver, you might be Lightly Active on a very busy day.)
* Active (PAL 1.6): you spend most of your waking hours standing, and you're walking around fairly often - people caring for multiple small children probably fall into this category; if you work, your job is probably something like retail, foodservice, etc.
* Very Active (PAL 1.8): you spend most of your waking hours walking around, possibly carrying heavy stuff; if you work, your job is probably something like warehouse stocking, construction, cleaning or painting, landscaping, etc.

I do like 1200 as a target for you, but not as an ""under 1200"" or treating it like a limit.  Treat it like a bullseye.  

I view the goal as a target -- like a bullseye.  Picture that round dartboard in your mind, with the bullseye in the center.   If my goal is 1500, then 1450-1550 is a bullseye.  The next ring is 1350-1450 OR 1550-1650 and that's good but not a bullseye.   The next further ring is 1250-1350 OR 1650-1750 and that's still on the target board but it's not close to the bullseye.   Example:  [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5RWhC2e.png)

Fair | Pretty good | Bullseye!! | Pretty good| Fair
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
1250-1350 | 1350-1450 | 1450-1550 | 1550-1650 | 1650-1750

So, for you, make 1150-1250 your center and then go out from there to draw your target.  Try to hit around 1200 daily.  Doing it this way keeps you from undereating (and under nourishing your body).

t3d1e9,hywepvd,t1_hyu6nhw,"Deficit isn't a steady state.  It's better thought of as chunks of time -- some in surplus, some in deficit.   Someone who has a reasonable daily deficit still has time amounting to hours in surplus but the balance is weighted more to the deficit.  

Take your deficit thought and break it down -- not by the day, or even by the hour, but to a resolution more towards a minute (it's probably more like 5 minutes).  Think in terms of what your body's net metabolism is in the space of 5 minutes.  (Thinking exercise:  it's probably in deficit 5 minutes before a meal, it's probably in surplus 5 minutes after a meal.)

Your average TEE is going to be about 1.5 Calories a minute (7.5 Calories each 5 minutes), so you won't sip anything caloric that slowly (be it alcohol or apple juice) and stay in deficit.  If you're drinking, you're not staying in a deficit.  

What's more, the liver can only handle alcohol so fast which is why we can get drunk and we feel that across our body -- the alcohol backs up in our bloodstream waiting to be processed.  Veteran drinkers do build up a larger capacity which is why some of us are ""lightweight drinkers"" and others are more alcohol tolerant and aren't fazed by the first couple of drinks.  

While alcohol is backed up in our blood chemistry, so is any excess blood glucose. 

Whatever the liver happens to be doing at the time it gets hit by that energy, it switches to that energy (alcohol first).  

> Even on a deficit you could prevent fat burning until you fall asleep during which time your body has to make up for it by doing a fast fat burn?

Somewhat.  Heart beats faster (you can hear/feel it pounding as you lay there), body temp goes up, you sweat into your clothes/sheets.  But all this while, you are in energy surplus.  The easiest thing for the body to do is to fill fat cells so some of that is going on too.    This sounds scary to us weight-losers so let me remind you that there are 24 hours in a day and it's still going to be CICO across the days -- if we keep our intake calories below our expenditure across our days, we'll NET burn fat and lose weight despite these hours of surplus where we gained a bit.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646133994.0

What I do is begin by writing down on index cards each meal I want to make. (Tonight's meal, for example, is written as ""Chicken cacciatore, white rice or cauliflower rice, pan-seared zucchini, garlic toast. ""  This is helpful so you remember what sides go with it later.   

Once you get the meals all written, you can sort them into categories. What the categories are is up to you. Some may be more elaborate and cause you to spend more time in the kitchen. Some may be really good for busy days. You can sort by vegetarian and type of meat, or by cooking style.   My own categories for my meal plan are ""slab of meat, Italian, Special (more time in kitchen), Chinese takeout, Mexican, World (Indian or Thai), and Stirfry.  I also schedule one meal (usually Sunday lunch) as a leftover cleanup day once a week. 

Then you pick what category gets which day of the week, and start assigning meals, and writing them down.  I do a five week rotation as that's long enough that any one dish goes from ""Oh, THAT again?"" to ""Hey, we haven't had THAT in a while, yum!""  

I eat the same thing for breakfast every day, and we eat the same seven things for lunch, since everyone works from home.  These are easy things like hamburgers or quesadillas. 

Once you have a meal plan like that getting food ready on time becomes very easy because you can precook.  You can include, as part of your evening routine, getting anything that needs to thaw out of the freezer so it's ready for you tomorrow. I even go so far as to write out menus and post them on the wall by the kitchen door. That way people don't have to keep asking, ""What's for dinner tonight?""

So advice:
If you sustain ambitious weight loss targets seek medical advice and get regular check ups. A friend went on a VLCD for 6 months (shakes only) and lost a ton of weight successfully - but under strict medical supervision, supplements, regular blood work etc.
Fruit and non starchy veg are your friend. Minimal carbs, some protein. Eat as healthy as you can.
Acknowledge food will be for maintenance only, not pleasure.
Black coffee is a great appetite suppressor for a short time.
No alcohol.
Reverse your cardio and weights calorie targets, especially if you lift already. Cardio burns more than weights, and if your not doing it already your body will respond better to cardio as well.
Make sure you‚Äôre doing leg day if you jog.
Consider adding a bit of IF and/or meal replacement shakes as par of your CICO.

Finally your short term aim is quite likely setting yourself up for failure. Are you ready for that and to pick yourself up and keep going? you will likely see a lot of weight roll off in the first month (especially if you add cardio) but this will drop off as your body adjusts and you lose weight. Don‚Äôt forget that when you lose weight your maintenance calories drop surprisingly fast, so you need to adjust your targets. Also without any breaks to your workouts your body is likely to tire and increase the chance of injury. So my final advice is set a long term realistic target, and if you lose a lot in the short term treat it like a bonus.

Good luck.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646168029.0

t3hn3y,hysay42,t3_t3hn3y,"- All weight loss boils down to calorie intake

- First, determine your rough [TDEE](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

- Subtract 500-1000 from your TDEE to set your calorie goal

- Buy a digital food scale (only around $15)

- Sign up to a calorie tracking app such as MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, Cronometer 

- Weigh all solid foods/ingredients on your food scale and measure liquid calories in measuring cups/spoons, input the data into your food diary

- Do your best to stick with meals you prepare yourself, and if you're having takeout/family cooked meals, weigh your meal components on the scale and find the closest calorie entry in the app

- Focus on hitting a good [protein intake](https://examine.com/nutrition/protein-intake-calculator/) and eating plenty of whole foods high in fiber for long-lasting satiety

- Find forms of daily exercise you enjoy, check out the /r/fitness sidebar for strength programs if you want to start strength training as well

t3elsy,hyrshot,t3_t3elsy,"So, yes and no. 

The answer to fear is information, so there is no need to stress over this.  

Your body probably has a set point somewhere between 60-71 kg and it will, through hormonal signaling, try to get you to eat more often or not eat as often to return you to that set point.  It is stubborn but adaptable.  Mine was 135 kg once.  It's around 78kg now.    

Another inconvenient truth about having been 71 kg before is that it will be easier to become 71 kg again.  Your body made those adipocytes and even though it drains them of their triglyceride, it doesn't get rid of them.  They are small now, but ready and waiting.  

When you overate beyond 65 kg for the first time, briefly your body likely increased its metabolism through temperature and non-exercise activity thermogenesis but it didn't burn enough, so it also created those cells.  It's a result of good evolution and this ability to store extra energy in times of plenty helps keep us alive through famines.  

When you drop below 63 kg, your body will likely nudge you to eat more often.  The less extreme you are about it, the easier it will be to tolerate.  The better your nutrition, the easier it will be.  

Given the choice between a weight-loss that takes more time and one that gets it done quickly, always choose the one that takes more time.   Not only are those losses easier to create and keep, they teach us the eating lessons that will arm us for the future of staying at our goal weight and monitoring our weight to ensure we do.",8,0,0,False,False,False,1646052289.0

My guess is that the exhaustion from the anemia tanked your energy levels to the point where your NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis - the calories you burn from activity that isn't exercise) was on the floor. If you're too tired to move, you're just not burning as many calories.

> any tips to break this 

If the calories are right for fat burning, then you are fat burning.  Someone eating ~1330 Calories at 241 is definitely burning fat to make up the difference between that intake and their much-higher TDEE.   There is no question.  

You can't gain -- or even maintain -- bodyfat on a deficit.  However, just because you burned fat at 4pm doesn't mean you weigh less at 4:01 pm.   Our fat cells release their energy in a water process called hydrolyzation.  That filled fat cell membrane is opened with water (hydrolysis) and that water can stick around for a while.   The now-spent cell is still there, the water is still there, and the energy inside is now part of your bloodstream ready to be used to heat our body, move some muscle, think some thoughts, or many other things it needs energy for.

My suggestion is this:  use plateaus to remind us to make sure our logs are right and tight, that we're measuring as we should, that our calorie goal is still right for our current stats, and determine whether or not we're still solidly in a deficit.   (It sounds as if you are sure right now.)    Then, just keep going.   Don't worry about the scale results -- they're coming, keep going on the things that will make them come about.

Our bodies are not mostly composed of fat.  Our bodies are ~60% water (give or take several percent) by mass, and the amount changes from hour to hour, and day to day. The exact amount varies according to the rhythm of your digestive system, your food and beverage intake, sodium levels, hormones, activity, strains, etc..  [A diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Bnzgors.png) ^\[[source](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html)\] shows what a typical body at maintenance weight takes in and expels per day, most of it is water! **So, most of the weight changes we see on any given weigh-in are water changes, not fat changes.** 

Water weight is one reason we should weigh consistently: first thing in the morning, after using the toilet, but before dressing or eating/drinking. When you drink a glass of water your weight instantly goes up by 1/2 pound! However, even when being consistent, there will still be a lot of variation from day to day, so it's important not to get discouraged by that.

> I can't explain these frequent plateaus and gains. I suffer from insomnia and chronic stress aswell and I'm constantly bloated. Ever since I started to introduce more food and dinner I'm also constipated despite being active. 

In your log, can you figure out if you're getting 25-30 daily grams of fiber?  

If you are, then let's also make sure you're getting the 8-cups of liquid (or a little more if the liquid is not water).  As a last resort, if you're not pooping, start this particular mild laxative following the label directions (do not overdose) called MiraLAX.  After it works for a couple of weeks, start backing off of it.

If you are not getting 25-30 daily grams of fiber, eat more vegetables and fruit daily -- including berries of any kind (any fruit with the word -berry in the name -- black, blue, straw, rasp -- these fruits have a lot of fiber and they're also full of water and low calorie).  If you're still not at 25-30 daily grams and are not pooping, then add some psyllium husk such as Metamucil sugar-free, following the label directions.  After it works for a couple of weeks, start backing off of it.

If that doesn't get you going like a regular person should go, then see your doctor. 

Your gut may be inflamed, and your lack of sleep and your stress probably has your cortisol high and your body's inflammation high.  Sleep and good exercise are really needed.  I'd like you to focus on meditative efforts -- listening or singing to some favorite songs that uplift you, reading a book of poems but doing 1 poem a day and then thinking about it, if you have a religion you can do a section of your text per day in a similar fashion.

Your body has more than likely normalized your calorie deficit. The human body loves to stabilize and get into an equilibrium to function properly.

t2k4kx,hyq9nux,t3_t2k4kx,"I can relate to your story. I am a 49yr old RN and have struggled with bulimia for 34 yrs now. Without being preachy & trying not to write you a book, here is the advice I‚Äôd give you.

1. GET RID OF THE SCALE! After moving away from home, I NEVER have owned one! Learning to obsess over my weight from my mother, who constantly counted calories and weighed herself several times a day..I can say that I don‚Äôt miss feeling like a slave to a scale, then being devastated & hating myself when I don‚Äôt see results! 

2. Change your focus from what you weigh, to improving your overall health & wellbeing. 

3. The thought, ‚Äúif I were only thinner & in better shape, I‚Äôd be so much happier & life would be so much better‚Äù...NOT TRUE! You can end up wasting years of your life on that thought & before you know it, you‚Äôll be 49 and dealing with all the health issues I have! Live your life, you are so much more than the # on the scale! 

3. Love yourself, understanding who you are and why you are the way you are, is empowering. If you happen to have unresolved trauma or abuse, things you‚Äôve never sought therapy for, please reach out for help. Same goes for mental health issues, including eating disorders. 
I ignored all of my past trauma and SA and it nearly killed me. I was triggered & spiraled into a deep and dark depression. It wasn‚Äôt until I was almost 47 that I finally sought help. I was diagnosed with ADHD & CPTSD just prior to my 49th bday. Now I am no longer just ‚Äútreading water‚Äù I‚Äôm making progress. 

4. Go see your PCP, along with a NUTRITIONIST & BE 100% OPEN & HONEST with them! Tell them EVERYTHING you are dealing with, including the ED. You will never get the right help, if they don‚Äôt know your total health history. 

5. Have blood work done, all the basics, along with TSH, hormone levels, vit D (as a deficiency can cause depression & intense fatigue) along with other serious side effects. I‚Äôd also recommend checking for inflammation & making sure your body isn‚Äôt being effected by Candida overgrowth. Both of these things can effect every system in your body and cause most of the symptoms you listed above...ANXIETY, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, STRESS, INSOMNIA. I am completely out of whack right now & dealing with a lot of this due to 34 yrs with bulimia & the imbalance it has caused throughout my body. I have widespread inflammation due to systemic fungal infections and it‚Äôs NOT FUN! 

6. DRINK MORE WATER!

7. Alcohol & cigarettes only INCREASE the risk & severity of widespread inflammation, which can lead to multiple health issues, in every system of the body.

8. CUT OUT SUGAR, or drastically reduce the amount you consume. Sugar is a MAJOR player in inflammation & Candida overgrowth. This includes alcohol. Having an eating disorder throws your body out of balance, which can cause the bad flora/yeast to thrive...eating sugar feeds that yeast & both cause inflammation. The longer you let it go, the worse it becomes. If you happen to eat sugar & processed foods often, cutting it out of your diet can make you sick for 1-2 weeks (like a mild flu) while your body kills off the yeast. 

9. I highly recommend watching the documentary ‚ÄúFat, Sick & Nearly Dead‚Äù about how the food you eat can contribute to systemic inflammation and a slew of other health issues. 

Honestly, after addressing not only my MH issues, eating disorder & understanding the effects they‚Äôve had on my overall health, it‚Äôs much easier to take care of myself & eat right. I can see the bigger picture..a holistic approach to life, recognizing that along with physical health, we need to address mental, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual health. It really is a lifestyle change. 

Best of luck! I hope you were able to take away something useful from the things I‚Äôve shared...from what I‚Äôve experienced & from what I‚Äôve learned along the way. ‚ô•Ô∏è",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646016783.0

t34nbr,hyqg6pc,t3_t34nbr,"Eat foods with a lot of water in them.  Water dense food has a lot of mass that will make you feel full, but not a lot of actual calories. 

Watch out for calorie dense foods like oils or dried fruit/nuts. These have a ton of calories.  They have good nutrition, but loads of calories.  Always try to go for fresh options over dried options. 

Calculate how many calories you are burning during your workouts. Divide by two and add it to your daily calorie budget. Ie. If you work out and burn 1000 calories in a day on a 1500 calorie budget, add the 500 calories on to your daily budget to 2000 calories. This will support your workout but still have you at a deficit. 

Make sure you only do this on workout days. 

Get a food scale. Weigh what you eat for realistic understandings of how much you are eating. 

You have done a lot of this already before. Your stress is high right now so your body is trying to support you.  Forgive yourself and thank your body for supporting you through this tough time.  Let your body know that you are ok and that it can relax and resume normal functions.  

The psychological aspect of loosing weight I think is the most ignored. The more you hate yourself, the more you punish yourself, the worse it will get. Forgive yourself and look forward. Think about next September, the cute clothes you will be wearing and the fun you will be able to have.

t3eyvy,hyryqbk,t3_t3eyvy,"Drop the word ""cheat"" and call it something else.   If you're a weekend socializer, then you need to adjust your plan so that your weekdays are even lighter.    There is no cheat -- CICO is just the math.  That said, life needs tension and relief and it is not like life not to have times of work and times of play.

IF YOU ARE NOT TRACKING CERTAIN DAYS:  You need to track your weekend foods just as you do your weekday ones so that you see what is happening -- tracking does not mean not having them, it simply means appreciating what they are.   A GPS doesn't mean your lost, it means you know where you are.  (Tip: when you don't want to take the time to log, take a picture of your food and log it later.)   Remember that your friends aren't preparing foods as you would prepare them.  You likely use the lower-calorie products at home.   They probably do not.

With that said, there will still be weekend rises and weekday falls.  That just follows because of the extra water that comes as a result of more food.  Our bodies are not mostly composed of fat.  Our bodies are ~60% water (give or take several percent) by mass, and the amount changes from hour to hour, and day to day. The exact amount varies according to the rhythm of your digestive system, your food and beverage intake, sodium levels, hormones, activity, strains, etc..  [A diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Bnzgors.png) ^\[[source](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html)\] shows what a typical body at maintenance weight takes in and expels per day, most of it is water! **So, most of the weight changes we see on any given weigh-in are water changes, not fat changes.** 

Water weight is one reason we should weigh consistently: first thing in the morning, after using the toilet, but before dressing or eating/drinking. When you drink a glass of water your weight instantly goes up by 1/2 pound! However, even when being consistent, there will still be a lot of variation from day to day, so it's important not to get discouraged by that. 

Use a weight-smoothing app called [Libra \(for Android\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra&hl=en) or [Happy Scale \(for iPhone\)](https://happyscale.com/).   

One of these apps will help you see the trends more clearly with less of the volatile data noise of water.  A temporary [spike](https://i.imgur.com/LIxSC8w.jpg) won't disturb the trend and, when you get used to this, will be both less disturbing and more accurate to what's actually happening with your fat-loss effort.  Always, always, always discount the latest weigh-in as meaningless to everything except for the trend.   Recalibrate your brain to that trend line and you'll gradually learn to be less alarmed at Monday's scale reading.",5,0,0,False,False,False,1646055725.0

Nutrition guidelines recommend filling half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. One quarter protein, one quarter wholegrains. (Check out the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate for more info, if you like.) So how about two slices of bread with a protein-rich topping plus a mountain of veggies to fill the rest of the plate: One average sized bell pepper provides a day's worth of vitamin A and C for under 40kcal. Add to that other low-cal fillers such as radishes, tomatoes, pickles, cucumber, carrots, etc.

I would recommend checking out r/Volumeeating A calorie deficit doesn't have to feel like one, if you manage to fill your plate.

t2b05p,hym0go5,t3_t2b05p,"I used to HATE exercise. Not just aerobic exercise, but any form of movement. If I dropped something, I would use my feet to pick it up or just leave it rather than bend down. I would drive to my mailbox. I would find excuses to be as sedentary as I possibly could. I've tried working out a million times over the years and the ""do something you enjoy"" isn't as easy as it sounds, especially if you're someone like me who has never ever enjoyed physical activity whatsover, either as an adult or as a kid.

So I'll share what I did - it'll be long - but I hope it'll help even a little bit.

In retrospect, I realize the reason I didn't like moving was because it required tremendous amounts of effort. Walking a few steps meant I was out of breath and an achy back. I was just so out of shape and my lungs were so bad (lifelong asthma, heavy smoker for awhile, allergies that gave me chronic breathing issues), that if I could do anything sitting, I would. Well, my husband really helped me get started and he is a patient man, and he suggested to just start slow. Like....stupid slow. He encouraged me not to pay attention to numbers, to just build strength, which is what I wanted to do anyway. My back is terrible and I also have always had bad knees and therefore had reasons not to exercise, but I reached the point where I realized I needed to exercise in spite of my ailments. My starting weight was only 132lbs so it's not like my goal was to really lose weight (I'm short so 132lbs was on the higher end of the BMI index for me). So that was my first small goal, to just get stronger. We did leg and arm exercises for over half a year. Nothing strenuous at all, light weights, just enough to make me feel active but to not feel ""difficult"" and he would accompany me the entire time so I never felt bored. We upped the weights and reps when it became easier.

Eventually, I added ight cardio. And again, I'm talking *light* cardio. We took my mom's old stationary bike from the 80's and I started just riding 1km on that. 1 measly km, and that first week, it was hell for me. Halfway through my first km, I couldn't breathe. But I did that 3x that first week and the next week, it was less hard, so I eventually upped it to 2km. And I realized that eventually I was gonna have to find something to do while I biked because I was doing longer distances so I started reading Wheel of Time. That became my nightly ritual, and I looked forward to it. I believe I did this for about 3 or 4 months without changing my diet, so I didn't lose any weight, but I was becoming physically stronger and I started feeling better, I started enjoying the sweat and the burn, it didn't feel like pain anymore, it just felt invigorating. Eventually I upped it to 15km. Eventually my times got better.

About a 1 year after doing that first squat and lifting that first 2lb dumbbell, I decided to start walking outdoors. And that also took time for me to build up stamina, even just walking around. It started with a painful 15 minute walk around the block (it was like -16 out and windy so it was probably more difficult than it needed to be) and I remember when I got home how crappy I felt about myself that I had spent a year strength training, building up my stamina on the bike, only to struggle through a 15 minute walk. But that 15 minutes turned into 20, which turned into half an hour and now I'm on week 5 of C25K and even on my off days, I go trail running for fun. Now I'll go for a 1.5 hour hike by myself in -20 weather and it makes me feel alive.

If you had told 2020 me that this is what I'd be doing and that I would enjoy it, I would bet against me. I had thought that I would always hate exercising because of the things I had convinced myself but I think if your body is stronger, it doesn't see exercise as this tiring chore anymore but rather as an activity that fuels it and makes it feel better and run smoother. I'm far from where I wanna be physically, and I've only lost about 6 lbs in a 1.5 year period, but I'm a completely different person now. I don't have any more breathing problems, my insomnia (and all the crappy symptoms that came with it) is non-existent, I have energy, and I just feel good both physically and mentally.

But like I said, these minor changes took place over a period of 1.5 years. I didn't just walk outside the door and think, I'm gonna try and start running. Every time I had done that in the past (running, HIIT, barre, pilates, biking, you name the activity), I gave up after the first couple times because it was too painful when you're that out of shape going from 0 to 50.

It wasn't until 2022 that I even started CICO and now the weight is coming off faster because as most people will tell you, diet is more important for weight loss than exercise. And if that's your goal, then make small changes in the kitchen first. But if you do want to develop good habits and not hate exercising the rest of your life, then I encourage you exercise patience when it comes to introducing activity into your day-to-day. But I promise, if someone like me can do it, I believe anyone can.

Sticking to a realistic daily calorie goal and walking a good few miles a day will get you to where you want to be weight loss wise.

For a very long while I could not find anything I could stick to, and I tried a lot of stuff, but they all just made me so miserable and I dreaded them every time I had to do them.

But surprisingly, the COVID lockdowns were a silver lining in the cloud because one day I attempted to go for a walk first thing in the morning when I would have been commuting to work, and I realise it wasn't too bad.  Turned out it was all the people and traffic on the roads later in the day that stressed me out.

I don't rely on my walking steps to lose weight; actually I can't lose the weight and keep it off unless I practise CICO and reduce what I'm eating.

Over time, I managed to gradually increase my steps per day, until now I'm actually jogging at around 22,000 steps from 4 to 6 am, every day.  It is still difficult to do, to get up in the morning to get my steps in, but I always think of the ""WHY"", which is to make sure that my blood work stays normal, which thanks to the running I have now reversed my Type 2 diabetes in addition to being at normal weight by dieting.

The amount of calories burned from lifting or cardio is so minimal compared to your CICO deficit. Can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet. 

That being said, I would never recommend anyone not workout. Strengthening your heart, improving your VO2 max, building lean muscle are all big indicators of health and longevity. 

Most people don‚Äôt like to exercise, you‚Äôre not alone. Just try to find something that fits you. I don‚Äôt know what type of hobbies you may have but here‚Äôs what I did and I‚Äôll throw in a list of suggestions for you also. Ironically, some of my nerdy hobbies helped me lose significant weight. I lost 30 lbs in my teenage years playing DDR. I lost about 20 pounds over a few months that I had gained while in university by simply walking 60-120 minutes/daily while listening to podcasts and playing Pok√©mon go. 

Suggestions for you: 

-Treadmill walk + movie/book/podcast/ebooks/music/video games/phone call with friends/lectures (if you‚Äôre a student)/mobile games

-Walk/hike + with a friend(great time to chit chat and hang out to relieve stress)/ augmented reality mobile gaming (such as ingress, Pok√©mon go, pikmen) / podcast / e book / music 

-Bicycling, a causal bike ride is often fun and not too physically demanding. Again, another thing you can do with friends or while listening to a form of media. 

-Dance Dance Revolution/Beat Saber/RingFitAdventure/Just Dance(the video games)

-Fitbit challenges (if you have a Fitbit and use their app, you can create challenge groups with friends or other users. These always motivate me. Just tracking my steps and other fitness stats is a rewarding way to see progress. Turns it into somewhat of a game.)

I've never been that fit, and one year ago when I picked up running I could basically run for 30 to 45 seconds before being winded and having the stop.

Larger people: you're not imagining things. Your anxiety comes from a real place, and that might be childhood bullying, bad advice/disdain from people in your life, or judgmental interactions you've had interacting with sports. Your anxiety or the gross feeling of being watched/waiting for strangers to comment is paranoid, but is unfortunately tied to past experience. My advice is not to pretend no one is looking at you or that your fear someone will say something to you is invalid, but that those people are rude and wrong, and not worth your time. Anyone who's suggested a fitness activity ""might not be for everyone"", who stares while you're struggling, who maybe tried to convince you not to participate, is wrong in their actions, and you deserve better than listening to their opinion. You know fitness is good for you, and beyond the basic joint and injury protection  practices all athletes should use, anyone who tries to deny you a space in that sport/fitness or doesn't know staring is rude doesn't deserve to take this from you.

Any thinner people reading this: please don't assume larger people are novices just because they haven't lost the exact amount of weight you'd expect them to. Please believe larger people when they say they're into sport X or achieved accomplishment Y.

It's by no means a ""quick fix"" as my results took a year of taking the pill, waiting an hour and then drinking. And 6-12 months is the average time, but there are outliers who take 3 months and others who take 3 year, a lot of people find tracking their drinking to be motivating to see the process but it can be a rollercoaster.

Most people who follow through with the treatment and are medication compliant can see a marked different like you see in these last two screenshots of my drink tracking app. A lot of people choose sobriety and yet another portion decides to continue taking the pill and waiting an hour whenever they want to drink in the future, and can do so effortlessly.

Some meds work better than others, and sometimes you need to increase the dose, for example. If you are not in any treatment for depression then I would recommend finding out what's available.

In terms of exercising: doing workout videos isn't the only way to get fitter. If you actually enjoy them on a good day, then great, but you could consider something less rigid in scope and just try going for a walk somewhere nice instead. It's better than starting something (a video) that has a specific end point with various steps to get there, and that you feel you can't complete perfectly. If you go on a walk then you determine how long it's going to be, where you go and at what pace. You also don't have to look at the instructor demonstrating the moves perfectly, as if that's the only way to do something.

I know that it's hard to see the point in anything from where you are now, but you could try to envision a future you where you are enjoying life and you want to do things.

Exercising your willpower is a habit.  You can't rely on motivation and passion because those come and go like a whim.   The mornings are usually our strongest times -- set a stake in the ground that you'll always start your workout before the hour of X.  Then, do it.

Weight management is food management.  It is not exercise management.   If you gained 6 pounds, it's because you ate 6 x 3500 Calories more than your body burned across that time.   Now you can't diet your body strong -- only physical activity makes a strong body.   But, likewise, you can't outperform your fork -- only managing your food intake manages your bodyfat.  Your workouts will never keep up with an overactive fork.

The 'skinny jab' is a diabetes drug that is also being used for weight-loss.  Dangerously, it is trendy.  All the people who have used their credit cards and zapped their fat with sound or radio waves, frozen their fat, quit their weight-loss memberships after a few weeks, and so on are going to be attracted to this -- and, again, get out their credit cards.  It is likely to work until they stop doing it and then their weight will come back because it doesn't solve their problem: they take in more energy than their body burns.  The drug is an appetite suppressant.

As for exercise, no diet or shot or spa treatment will give you a strong, healthy body.  Regular physical activity -- something you like that makes your body move -- is also required.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646046342.0
t2lwcl,hyrkqet,t1_hyreudk,"Your body's BMI is 25.5  ... that's a borderline call.  My doctor (my body's medical expert) kept me at that weight for 5 years before deciding to lower my goal.  It's now at BMI 24.5.   The rationale:  I have a chronic condition where I sometimes can't eat and may need that fat to help sustain me for a few weeks of not processing food.

Ask your body's medical expert.   If they say that you're good here, then the work continues to maintain it at 65 kilos.

If they say to go lower, it's okay.  Plateaus are not a problem -- because our water% is so volatile, weight loss at these weights and small deficits looks like a series of plateaus.   You will lose at a rate of less than 1 kg a month at 1500 ""with occasional overeating.""

Because of this, how about 1350-1400 as a target to give you some cushion for those bigger days that sometimes happen.  Your BMR is over 1350.     

Either way:   Even though your lifestyle is sedentary, you can still exercise some -- there is a 10% of BMR benefit to a session of moderate (e.g. walking) exercise.   Diets don't make us strong -- we have to give our body physical activity to accomplish that.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646047076.0

You get those just-started ""newbie gains"" for a short-time either way.  But training on a deficit, the long-term goal is muscle preservation and any gains you eke out are bonus.   That preservation is valuable because any mass and strength that you preserve now is something that you won't have to win back later if you put off starting weight training.

Other benefits are starting your eventual healthy habits now while you're motivated and the appetite-suppressing quality and preoccupation with something else during an otherwise long and boring weight loss process.    You also need a few weeks of light weights and good form before you start to push hard -- jumping in hard (unless you have a good trainer to guide) can cause injury due to poor form and poor judgment.   Start with very light weight and perfect your form, then add weight.

t1zw05,hykj6sa,t3_t1zw05,"> Eating 1675 calories and feel like I‚Äôm entering an eating disorder

Then I suggest you take immediate action. Trust me you don‚Äôt want one of those if you can avoid it. Contact a therapist. Preferably one with expertise in eating disorders.

> I‚Äôm currently eating between 1600-1700 calories but try to stay under 1675. I weight 266lb, 5‚Äô9‚Äù and have lost a little more than 132lb. 

Congratulations on your successful weight loss. It‚Äôs a hell of an accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself. 132 lbs is literally an entire person. Well done. 

> I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm conformable around 1800-1900 calories but I can‚Äôt seem to lose any weight at that range so I‚Äôve been lowering my calories by increments of 75 calories. 

What are you eating? You mentioned volume eating but are you getting enough fat, carbs, cholesterol, salt, potassium, etc. Sometimes when I eat too ‚Äúclean‚Äù I tend to leave out necessary things the body needs and it leads to cravings. Are you eating the same things too often. Is it boring? 

> it seems that if I eat more than 1700 I start gaining weight. I used to be able to lose weight and enjoy certain foods but I feel like the past few months have been so restrictive. 

If you‚Äôve been on a restricted diet for months and are starting to feel it I often suggest taking a week or two to purposefully eat at maintenance. Being on a deficit is very stressful for the body and mind and it‚Äôs okay to acknowledge that. Maybe try practicing eating at maintenance for a few weeks. It‚Äôs a skill you‚Äôll need anyway so it‚Äôs worth practicing on your way down. Adding in 500 calories a day is noticeable. 

> I can only eat small portioned of chicken and broccoli, or lots of veggies. 

Ah, the old chicken and broccoli ‚ÄúBro diet‚Äù. A classic. What do you do for sauces? Cheese sauce? BBQ sauce? Honey mustard? Teriyaki? They make a lot of lower calorie version of sauces and spending even 50 calories on sauce can drastically change a meal. 

> I haven‚Äôt had rice in like 6 months. 

You can eat rice you just have to be careful with it. I had rice for lunch on Thursday. I weighed what I got from a restaurant and only ate half the rice.  

- Chicken Teriyaki - 242 cal
- white rice cooked - 182 cal
- shredded lettuce - 8 cal
- salad dressing - 68 cal
- diet orange soda - 0 cal

That‚Äôs a total of 501 calories which should fit in your budget.

> I eat cauliflower rice because I‚Äôd rather spend my calories in volume eating.

I also eat a bit of ‚Äúriced‚Äù cauliflower. Have you tried cooking it under a broiler with a bit of salt? 

> I can‚Äôt eat desserts, I can‚Äôt just go to a cafe and order a cute little pastry and enjoy these small moments in life. 

Starbucks chocolate croissant is 300 calories. Starbucks Banaba walnut and pecan loaf is 410 calories. Maybe cut it in half and eat half tomorrow. Starbucks sugar plum cheese danish is 330 calories. You could make that work in a 1700 budget a couple days a week assuming everything else is on point. 

That‚Äôs assuming you go with the full sugar versions. You may have a bakery or cafe near you that specializes in keto or diabetic friendly options.

You could also get into baking your own. Just use sugar substitute with regular recipes. 

> i go to friends dinners and have salad and a few pieces of chicken breast. 

It‚Äôs funny to me that everyone treats salad as a sad weight loss food because to me salad is a treat. Then again if I‚Äôm making a salad it‚Äôs going to be a significant experience. I‚Äôm taking like 5-6 cups of mixed greens (100 cal), an entire strip of thick bacon cut up (60 cal), a hard boiled egg (68 cal), 100 grabs of grilled chicken (131 cal), an entire cucumber cubed up (34 cal), a whole Roma tomato chopped (35 cal), quartered raw mushrooms (25 cal), and a quarter cup of shredded low-fat mozzarella (65 cal). Then mix in like 200 calories of light honey mustard dressing or light creamy Cesar and it‚Äôs 719 calories.  

I don‚Äôt eat it around people because it‚Äôs embarrassing. It‚Äôs an entire mixing bowl filled with food. It looks like it should be shared by a family of 6. It takes like an hour to get through it. Lol. 

So I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre eating a chicken salad for dinner and aren‚Äôt satisfied by it you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Put more stuff in it. You need to make a salad that Elaine from Seinfeld would say ‚Äúwoah, too big.‚Äù 

> i feel like I have to go out of my way to make sure my 3 daily meals fit into my calorie range.

You don‚Äôt have to always eat 3 full meals a day. Sometimes 4-5 eating breaks is good. Some people swing the other way and do the OMAD (One Meal A Day) thing. OMAD doesn‚Äôt do it for me but it‚Äôs worth experimenting with. Some people like a heavy breakfast. Some people like a very light breakfast (eg: coffee and 2 scrambled eggs - 200 cal). Maybe look at not just what you‚Äôre eating but also how you are distributing it through your day. 

> It‚Äôs mentally exhausting and I feel like my body is barely getting by. 

I‚Äôd say you could use a break from the deficit. Eat at maintenance for a bit and keep an eye on your nutrients. How‚Äôs your potassium and iron looking? If your body is saying it‚Äôs too much maybe there is something to look into. Maybe head into a doctor for blood work. You never know what a simple vitamin deficiency can do to your appetite and sense of well being. Maybe you inadvertently left something out. 

Not to state the obvious but losing 132 lbs should have you feeling more energized not exhausted. 

> I workout 4 times a week and aim to eat 130-150g protein a day. 

Sounds good. You could get by with 100 g of protein if you think folding in a bit more fat would help keep you satiated or just improve your eating experience. I‚Äôm not saying you should but you can try it. 

> But I just feel like I‚Äôm a few steps away from throwing in the towel and going crazy on a junk food binge. 

One thing I‚Äôve found is that my cravings actually tell me things. Like when I start craving potato chips I always find I haven‚Äôt had enough salt in several weeks. So I up my salt content for a few days and the chip cravings go away. My ice cream cream cravings are usually associated with a lack of fat. You get the idea. So maybe if you‚Äôre feeling like your lizard brain wants a junk food binge pause for a second and try to sus out what it‚Äôs actually telling you. 

Like you I also found that my binges are never unexpected. The obsessive thoughts build up for days. Part of dealing with my brain for me is just giving it what it wants but on my own terms. If I feel like I‚Äôm going to go on a chocolate bender I‚Äôll go buy a single candy bar, drive to a park and it it in peace. I‚Äôll use low calorie chocolate sauce on my anabolic french toast. I‚Äôll mix in chocolate protein powder into my oatmeal for breakfast. Chocolate chips in protein packages. I‚Äôll eat chocolate all day long but on my terms. 

Since you mentioned out of control binges I suggest you go see a therapist. They can teach you skills to help break obsessive thoughts and interrupt spiraled thinking patterns. It takes time and work but it can get better. 

> I used to have cheat meals but I stopped because I realized it was ruining my progress. 

Same. 

> Now I treat myself like once every 2 months. I‚Äôm just exhausted I want a big order of fried chicken burger and fries. 

I‚Äôve found the problem with calorically dense food is really apparent when you stack it but if you break it up you can make it work. 

Like a chicken breast from chick fil a is 250 calories 24 g of protein. If you buy two that‚Äôs 500 calories 48 g of protein. If you cut them up and mix that into a salad with a bit of light dressing you can get a big meal and satisfy your fried chicken cravings for 700 calories or so. That‚Äôs easier to work around. 

The odd thing about fries is potatoes are always super high on the food satiety lists. So maybe try just making potatoes at home to start. Or just eat the fries as a meal. One large McDonalds fry is 500 calories. That could be lunch. Take it slow, eat one fry at a time, take drinks between each one, and if it gets you to dinner then you got away with it. 

> I haven‚Äôt had fast food in over a year. but I‚Äôm mentally terrified. It feels like everytime I take a step forward I take three steps back so is it really smart to add a big 2000-6000 calorie meal in for the sake of ‚Äúfeeling satisfied once in a while?‚Äù

As I said above I have found the opposite approach works better for me. A little bit here and there so I can never feel deprived. 

That said I haven‚Äôt had true fast food in quite a while as well. Mostly because calorie counting has turned me into a bit of a foodie. I‚Äôm going to be brutally honest McDonalds is kind of disgusting once you break the obsession over it. The meat is way too salty and the buns are sickeningly sweet. It‚Äôs overcooked tasteless food that is really expensive. I can do better for cheaper. 

I can press a patty of fresh meat, season it properly, pan fry it to perfection, load it up with fresh lettuce, guacamole, and tomato on a nice toasted bun and I‚Äôll kick anything on the McDonald‚Äôs menu in the dick. 

You want fries? I‚Äôll slice up some russet potatoes, rinse until the water goes clear, wash them in a bowl of water with a spritz of lemon juice, drain, toss them in a bit of truffle oil, and put them under a broiler until they are golden brown. Then I‚Äôll hit them with some flake salt or seasoned salt. McDonald‚Äôs fries are mushy and hollow. If you really want to beat McDonald‚Äôs use beef tallow like they used before 1990.

So I get that fast food is addicting but trust me when I say it‚Äôs obsession not ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù that is driving it. If you can break the obsessive thought pattern that you want fast food but can‚Äôt have it and just evaluate the food they offer for what it is the illusion will shatter. The food doesn‚Äôt back up the hype. That‚Äôs my perspective on it at this point anyway.",174,0,4,False,False,False,1645914702.0

You want to binge because you are missing something in your diet. It might actually be fat, carbs or it might be calories. Your TDEE (sedentary Maintenance), if you are female is 2300 calories, if you are male it is 2500. Since you work out 4 days a week You should be able to go to your TDEE and pause for a week or two. Add 100 calorie guac packs to your meals and eat some good quality eggs to add some fat, maybe even some fatty pork chops or bacon. The pause will allow you to rest your body and mind. Try a small chocolate square a day or even a KIND bar with chocolate to satisfy the sweet. Currently your BMR if female is 1900 and 2100 for male so you have been eating below that for a while. This means you are not fueling your body enough for metabolic processes and your body is likely fighting back.

Once you regain your equilibrium (don't wanna binge) you can get off the pause and start cutting again. Pausing is not giving up it is learning to live in your current body and making adjustments. Then you keep moving forward. The [TDEE calculator I use](https://tdeecalculator.net/) you can put in your goal weight and see where you will eventually live calorie wise to maintain

Are you counting sauces? A spoon of mayo can be about 100 calories and some people have that (and more) at most meals. 

This also includes salad dressing which can be high calories.

1700-1800 doesnt sound like a lot and it's actually sad to hear people say they don't eat rice to reach their calories. Half a cup of white rice is like 150-200 calories. That alongside 100g of chicken breast and peppers is about a meal of 400-500 calorie meal. Even if you eat that 3 times a day you're under your current calories. 

If i'm honest i wouldn't even include vegetables in your calories. Depends what you define by vegetables, im talking about broccoli, spinach, carrots etc. not such things as potatoes, yams etc. 

There's also varying factors. Forgive as these can only be assumptions, but what is your sleep like? Water intake? Salt intake? If you are measuring bodyweight by the scale, these things alone will move the dial 5 or 6 lbs each way. Bodyfat % is the real indicator. 

If i were you I'd take a break, go to maintenance calories, keep trying to be active and get 10k steps a day and do a bit of weightlifting. I'd skip cardio as I find this is taxing on the body and with the small amount of calories you're only getting, the bidy may further go into starvation mode. 

This starvation mode i keep mentioning is just a defence mechanism. If you keep losing weight the body gets scared and becomes resistant to losing more. That's why its better to do short calorie deficits followed by maintenance. 
Try 2 weeks calorie deficit, 2 week maintenance. And see how you feel after that. If you feel you've gained (you shouldn't) then adjust your maintenance calories by 100-200 less calories. Then if you want to drop a bit faster, 3 weeks deficit and 1 week maintenance.

1. You need a scale to measure those snacks. Chocolate, chips, ice cream. Whatever it is, 10grams can make a big difference. Measure it so that it can be part of your life.
2. Don't keep that food in the house. Go out and get it if you want it. This is to prevent you giving in to cravings when you're at the end of the day and willpower is weakest.

- G Hughes sugar free sweet chili dipping sauce is great on chicken too. 
- I like Rao‚Äôs pesto. It‚Äôs not low calorie but 25 grams (127 cal)is enough to help an entire tray of veggies. 
- hot sauce is remarkably low calorie. I recommend Secret Aardvark Aardvark Sauce, Secret Aardvark Smokey Aardvark Sauce, and Tapat√≠o Salsa Picante. my friend loves Truff White Truffle Infused Hot Sauce (10cal per tsp) but it‚Äôs a bit fancy for me. Your mileage may vary. 
- a simple hit of Worcestershire sauce can give chicken a good boost. Go very light though. Not because of calories but it‚Äôs a very strong flavor. Like if you have a bit of cheese and milk you can melt that together and give a cap of Worcestershire sauce and it‚Äôll be edible. 
- For pancakes, waffles and French toast I go with Coach Greg‚Äôs recommendations. Mrs. Butterworths sugar free syrup (10 cal per 2 Tbsp), Walden farms blueberry, Walden farms chocolate, Walden farms maple walnut, are all solid. Walden farms stuff is all very low calorie but some of their stuff is a bit chemically. The ones I listed are the ones I buy and use regularly though. So if you‚Äôre making protein pancakes, put a healthy spoon of plain Greek yogurt on top, syrup of your choice, and 100 grabs of fruit and you‚Äôre good to go. If you don‚Äôt like the tang of the yogurt just mix in a teaspoon or so of Splenda and it‚Äôll take it away. 
- ragu makes a jarred pizza sauce that has no sugar added to it. 63g per 1/4 cup. Tortilla pizzas are great. 
- I like Ken‚Äôs Steakhouse light salad dressings. The creamy Cesar and honey mustard are good. Walden farms Cesar has fewer calories but Ken‚Äôs Steakhouse tastes 100 times better imho. You can marinade the chicken in the salad dressing or apply it after. Your call.

So if you really like a brand of sauce see if they have a light version already. If they don‚Äôt Google ‚Äúx sauce low calorie‚Äù.  Or just look up volume eating recipes on YouTube. 

The other thing to look for for chicken is just dry seasoning. But look for sugar free seasoning. Or keto. Or whatever other keyword you can find. 

You can marinade chicken in Italian salad dressing (a couple hrs max before cooking) and it turns out remarkably well. 

I had a girlfriend who liked just putting chicken in a Pyrex dish, covering the chicken in salsa, topping with cheese and then cooking until done. If you served that with a side of veggies and Spanish rice it would be pretty reasonable. 

Smoked paprika on chicken is solid. 

You can make a really tasty dish with chicken, a can of fat free cream of mushroom soup, a package of chopped up mushrooms, and some seasoning (oregano, salt, pepper, parsley, etc). Just throw it all in a pan and bake until the chicken is done and then serve over grilled veggies.

I don't want you to get frustrated by something you can't control that other people don't understand when they give advice. 

It might matter more as you lose weight too. So say for example (all made up numbers coming up) an woman without pcos can eat 1900 calories to maintain their goal weight at your height somewhere in the 150s and that's what you based your deficit on. Then say your pcos has affected your metabolism and maybe you need to eat 1400 calories instead to maintain that same weight. Starting at 400 lbs with a maintenance of 3000 calories, you're going to lose weight because your deficit is large, whether your eventual maintenance will be 1900 or 1400. But as you get closer to your goal weight, your deficit may be much smaller than a TDEE calculator leads you to believe because it's based on the average woman without a hormonal disorder.

Likewise, I wasted years on 'waiting to feel like starting to \[insert goal\]' as if motivation was bestowed upon me by random passing clouds pouring rain.  News flash, it rarely rained, and when it did rain the rain quickly passed.

The reality is that it is repeated action, which creates new neurological wiring in the brain, which in turn automates some of our desires and actions, which in turn creates habits, which make continuous action easier, which then leads to repeating the action.

Willpower and motivation are mostly sporadic in most people most of the time. People who appear to have terrific willpower have usually (consciously or unconsciously) established routines and environments that encourage them to repeat the behaviors that support their goal, discourage those that don't support the goal, and have managed to hack their own mental barriers to working toward their goal long enough to establish habits that make sticking to the goal easier.

I would advise reading a book or two on habit formation (Atomic Habits was really eyeopening for me, Good Habits/Bad Habits was also good).

You also need to analyze your environment and routine for hidden cues that are supporting and encouraging behaviors you don't want. For example, I can resist a pint of ice cream in the freezer for weeks, but I can't resist fresh bread or sweet baked goods. Needless to say, I keep ice cream around for dessert but do not bake at home or go near the bakery at the store.  I make a pleasant ritual about doing body weight work in my home (keep the weights and yoga mat out with a small container of water, in my pleasantly decorated bedroom, and I always ritualize the workout with some music/candles etc., so it feels weirdly indulgent rather than like a chore where I have to dig out weights from some closet and rush through it).

There is usually a huge psychological component to procrastination or resistance to starting. In my case, it was that I assigned a lot more mental 'difficulty' to exercise than I needed to. For example, I'd think of 'working out' as a very tiring, sweat filled, 30 minute minimum activity. No wonder I'd tell myself I'll work out today, but in the moment it always felt more pleasant to keep sitting on the couch!  Eventually I learned to start building the habit of doing ANYTHING by picking the lowest hanging fruit that I was least mentally resistant to doing. In my case, that was walking for 15 minutes per day, or doing 5 minutes of a bodyweight exercise. I scheduled it 3-4 x per week, and it was nonnegotiable, like toothbrushing. B/c it was such a small goal, it didn't feel insurmountable. And of course, what usually happened once I actually STARTED exercising is that I'd feel like extending the length of the session. But the important thing was simply building the habit of repeating the behavior. It takes 30 to 60 days minimum for the brain to build the neurological brain wiring to make the new behavior feel easier and more automatic.

Sometimes the psyschological barriers are trickier and weirder. I wanted to start swimming regularly for exercise. I knew I love how swimming makes me feel, but I couldn't get started for the longest time. I finally figured out that my brain has HUGE resistance to (and this sounds dumb) the process surrounding swimming, not the act of swimming. I didn't want the trouble of gathering the gear, driving to the pool, changing clothes, swimming, changing back, having no makeup and wet hair etc.)  Eventually I figured out that if I bought THREE bags' worth of ALL gear required to swim (towel, suit, goggles, cap, makeup, spare set of clothes, flip flops, etc) and stowed one bag at the gym, one in the car, and one at home, then I never had musty towel excuse, or 'I don't know where my goggles are it's too hard to locate them' excuse, or 'I happen to be driving near the gym on this errand and could squeeze in a swim but oops my swim gear is at home' excuse.

Brains are weird, and you sometimes have to get clever and creative trying different approaches to trick yours to climb those mental barriers long enough to establish the aforementioned habits.

Finally, some people feel more motivation when the goals are framed slightly differently. For example, years ago when I was first trying to improve my grasp of personal finance, I tried setting a traditional budget (that is, I will not spend more than X amount this month on eating out). It didn't work very well FOR ME.  I tend to get agitated and rebellious when I frame things as ""you can't do such and such at all"" and budgets felt super restrictive. Then a few years later, I read Your Money or Your Life and reframed how I looked at money. I started tracking what I spent in different categories, graphing the totals over time, and then asking myself the question ""Is this money you spent on this category worth it for the enjoyment and quality of life?"" For my personal psychology, seeing visible spending lines on a graph PLUS thinking about my money as fungible between categories really highlighted that most of the money I frittered away eating out was simply not that enjoyable. Whereas, the money I spent on gardening not only seemed worth it, but I decided to transfer some of what I used to spend on mindless Starbucks visits to gardening.  Later, I added 'tricks' like setting savings goals and graphing them against lines of debt owed. For example, I used to look forward to the day that my total slush fund investments would cross my total debt owed on the graph. For some weird reason, just seeing those lines inch together kept me motivated on savings for more than a decade.

Similarly, when trying to improve diet, I do well thinking of foods in term of nutritional 'bang'/calorie 'buck' so that even if I'm tempted to snack, I usually will opt for a healthier snack. Lots of people report being emotional eaters, and would do well to work on developing alternative behaviors for dealing with emotions (therapy can be helpful there). Some people find that the habits of their social circle are problematic and they need to make an effort to change their socializing context (this is often reported for people trying to stop drinking when they try to change the context in which they meet friends...e.g., getting together for a hike on weekends, rather than after work for drinks at a bar).

So you need to give close attention to your 'context' (that is environment, social circle, routine, etc) and your mental barriers (that is the often illogical but powerful stories your brain tells you) and your particular goal framing (that is, the scale of the goal, the labeling of the goal) and so on, and then start trying to tweak those as many times as needed to establish habits.

It's a great skillset to start being mindful of all these things, helpful in all sorts of areas of life.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1645984537.0

t2glta,hymzj3a,t1_hymxuwa,"> I think a lot of it is boredom hunger. I can think about what I had for breakfast and try and tell my self that there is no way your hungry. Self doesn‚Äôt listen.

This is an internal struggle that I've had to go through myself.  My inner self (my affectionate inner-fat-kid) is clever and defiant but I have found ways to get us both on the same side most of the time.

When he is in the zone, though, I try not to stop it entirely.  I do try to guide towards fruits, sugar-free popsicles, a couple of slices of lean deli meat -- turning a 500 calorie spree into a 200 calorie one.  Lately one of the tastes we like is a thin layer of peanut butter across the surface of a graham cracker (total < 100 Calories).  

That I don't try to clamp down entirely helps us stay on the same side -- we're both trying to stay healthy, but my inner child is emotional and my inner parent is rational so we try to find a way to cooperate rather than to impose our various wants onto each other (and incite an inner riot).

Of course, a lighter person needs fewer calories to maintain their weight, so the deficit can't go down that low.

I haven‚Äôt gotten any loose skin yet, but I struggled early on with maintaining my progress because I was so worried about loose skin. I watched tons of videos and stuff on it and it‚Äôs really just going to depend on your genetics, but there are some things you can do that may minimize it:

-build muscle, if you focus just on becoming thin and drop from a size 16/18 to a size 2 you will almost definitely have loose skin. Having some muscle means you probably won‚Äôt get that small, maybe around size 6/8 (from what I‚Äôve seen for our height range) and the loose skin will be minimized because of the muscle and less severe drop in sizing

-lose weight more slowly so your skin can adapt. Losing 60lbs over 1.5 years compared to 6 months will give your skin more time to adapt, but with drastic weight loss (<50lbs) it still may not be possible since your skin was stretched

-Collagen supplements (not sure of the scientific validity, just heard some people say it worked for them because it contributed to the elasticity of your skin. I use collagen powder, which is tasteless in hot liquids. I add it to oatmeal and soups)

-Lots of self care: dry brushing and body butters can help contribute to skin health 

-Drink water and maintain good nutrition

None of this is a guarantee, honestly it may not work. But the tough truth of the matter that I had to learn is that if I‚Äôm fixated on just the loose skin and that‚Äôs enough to deter me from losing the weight, I‚Äôm in it for the looks and not for my health, which was not a sustainable enough reason to lose weight nor was it healthy for my self esteem. It‚Äôs okay to have looks in mind when losing weight, but ultimately it should be out of love for yourself and body and not out of hate for yourself or the pursuit of a specific aesthetic image.

Also, I had to be mindful of what my options are: there‚Äôs clearly a reason I‚Äôd like to lose weight and there are consequences to remaining overweight, so therefore only have two options: I stay the same weight I am because of the fear of loose skin and bear those concrete consequences (aka I already know what they are because I‚Äôve lived them and hate them, such as lack of mobility, constant pain, etc) forever or lose the weight, regain my life back, and risk (keyword: risk, as in not guarantee) some loose skin. There is always a consequence to the choices we make, but for me one had more consequences than the other. So I had to accept it and reprioritize.

It also depends on you goals, if want to look ‚Äúlean‚Äù body weight will get you there no problems, if you want to be big and muscly then gym will be needed. For flat out weight loss body weight is 100% fine, just be in about a 500 cal deficit and train 3 times a week or when you can. The deficit will do more than the exercise for flat out weight loss. Bands are also awesome if you are allowed to use them.

20 Jab reverse (1-2 punch) 

10 push ups on knees

40 jab reverse

10 sit ups

60 jab reverse

20 push ups on knees

80 jab reverse

20 sit ups


Circuit 2
100 upper cut

20 reverse crunch/lying leg raises

40 front kicks

20 dips - I did these against a wall until I got a flat bench, you could also use a chair of any kind


Circuit 3

10 5 punch combo (jab, reverse, 2x body rip, upper cut)

20 squats

10 5 punch combo

20 squats


The way I progressed this was that each week I added 5 push ups, sit ups (both kinds), dips and squats. When I got to 30 push ups I started again at 10 but FULL push ups. I then added 50 upper cuts, 20 front kicks and 5 5 punch combos

I then started running the circuit twice. Currently I do the above but at am at 

Circuit 1

50 each push ups and sit ups

Circuit 2

300 upper cuts

50 dips and reverse crunches 

100 front kicks

Circuit 3

50 combos

50 squats

I read something about a decade ago that described a lot of habits people with ADHD or executive function use to cope with their lack of focus/other issues and it was like ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt have ADD but I sure do all those things! ü§î 
Now, I‚Äôm 43 and there are some things that became pretty illuminated during the pandemic when I didn‚Äôt have work/other responsibilities that made me tired/unavailable to use ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time‚Äù as an excuse/etc for me to finally say okay uhhhh yeah there‚Äôs something else going on. 

I sought therapy and had some great sessions but it was suggested I go through a 12 week trauma intensive series and while I do want to do that it became one of the things I just suddenly ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time for‚Äù even though obviously that‚Äôs not a great excuse. Fast forward nearly a year and I am at the end of my rope with some bad habits in my free time (back at work, lockdown way in the past), and lifestyle changes I need to make‚Ä¶ yes, food & exercise, but also an extremely difficult time just ‚Äúdoing the things‚Äù I‚Äôve been putting off. 
In therapy, I learned that avoidance is a trauma symptom (üí°!) but could also be depression or other reasons by a therapist and therapist said they didn‚Äôt wanna put me on any meds until i got through the 12 week trauma program.

There was an acknowledgement that some of my issues may be ADHD related, but they wanna focus on the trauma first. I guess that‚Äôs fair but I sure feel stuck in a loop I can‚Äôt get out of‚Ä¶ and even though I know logically that therapy will help, some part of me just can‚Äôt ‚Äúdo the thing‚Äù because it‚Äôs hard.   
Yes, I can do hard things. I do them all the time. But I sure do enjoy doing the things that provide me much more instant gratification‚Ä¶ IE food, sex, shopping, music, etc.  
Sidebar - How many more people are out there experiencing this? There must be millions. I think social media is also ‚Äúmedicating‚Äù a lot of people too but not in a healthy way. I recently FINALLY left FB because I felt it was such an unhealthy habit as well as just toxic in general.  Surely I can take the time I spent mindlessly scrolling FB and devote that to some positive lifestyle changes‚Ä¶ 


As I read your post I couldn‚Äôt help but remember how often I‚Äôve used the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, let‚Äôs eat!‚Äù to explain why food seems to be something to go to in times of needing to study, complete a task, etc. 

Sooo, all that to say what‚Äôs the name of the book you read about this, and how long did it take for you to get on ADHD meds to find some relief?  I need some relief from some of the things I‚Äôm struggling with and even though I know I may have a hard time getting myself to ‚Äúdo the thing‚Äù in this instance I think that the therapy/counseling/whatever it takes is perhaps THE ONLY thing that will help me feel like I can get my shit together.

See [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34385400/). Note this is even corrected for fat free mass, the most variability will be using weight without knowing precise body fat %. Which is actually hard to measure. 

TDEE is at best a guesstimate. It's just a multiplier on the BMR. 

The 1lb thing is true as in if you burn fat you release that amount of energy, but a 3500kcal deficit doesnt translate perfectly to 1lb of fat. 

These numbers are good as starting points, but recording accurately intake, exercise and weight shows how these numbers relate to an individual. Doing it for a long time can show trends as an individual changes with time.",5,0,0,False,False,False,1645987463.0
t2udvm,hyoeavv,t3_t2udvm,"Online TDEE calculators provide estimates based on population parameters. Your actual TDEE may be higher or lower. You can get an estimate of your body fat percentage using the Navy Tape Measure method (see https://www.calculator.net/body-fat-calculator.html), and plug that into tdeecalculator.net as well; that switches the formula from the Mifflin-St. Jeor Formula to the Katch-McArdle Formula ,which may give you a different (possibility lower) estimate of your TDEE. 

Weight loss is not linear. It's definitely not linear if you're a woman with a functioning uterus; your menstrual cycle will play a role in how much water you're retaining at any given point in time, which will in turn affect the number on the scale. 

Use a food scale for accuracy. 

TDEE decreases with weight loss - it takes less energy to move less mass. If you lose, say, five kilos, your body just won't burn as much energy because there's five kilos less of you to move around (for fun, after you've lost five kilos, pick up something that weighs five kilos and walk around for a bit to notice the difference!).

Weight loss on the scale is a combination of fat loss and muscle loss. Fat loss is what we want, muscle loss really isn't. Think about that five kilos, though; it doesn't take as much muscle to move you about if there's five kilos less of you. Muscle burns more calories than body fat, though, so it's good to minimize muscle loss if possible. Eating plenty of protein can help (abouttwo grams per kilo of estimated lean mass, I think, if I've done my conversions right), in conjunction with strength training - you actually need to use those muscles. 

I've managed to keep my TDEE constant this past year (and possibly increasing it a bit) while dropping 20 kilos by gradually increasing how much exercise I get in. I started with walking for 20 minutes a day and a 5k per day step goal; I've gradually increased that to running several days per week (ran a bit over 10k this morning; hit 15k steps during the run).

I ride a regular upright real bike ~5000 miles a year on roads and trails and whenever the weather is bad I go do the recumbent ones at the gym, have never done one of the upright stationaries.

Later on, out of sight, I tabulated it all with the USDA recipe calculator by weighing out ingredients as written (like I would take a handful of chopped carrot and weigh it).

You‚Äôd be surprised to learn that for someone experienced like your mom, although the recipe can look very dynamic, it‚Äôs almost always quite formulaic. My grandmother made it even easier because she learned to cook before pre-packaged meat/fish was a thing, so she always scales her recipes by weight of protein and it was just a matter of figuring out her formula.

Here's a plan. Just ask your mother what's in something that she makes often, *while she's not in the middle of cooking it*. Write it down and do your best to figure it out. 

Alternatively, if you type ""homemade soup"" (for example) into LoseIt, find an entry that's middle of the road and use that as a best guess. I find these entries are usually fairly accurate to what I make from scratch.

My mother was the same way - massively overfed me, and tried to pretend my weight gain wasn't that big a deal, until I told her I was bordering 300lbs. Then she panicked, talking about how bad that was, all without acknowledging her own hand in the situation.

t1557d,hyf6xb6,t3_t1557d,"I want to reply as a Latina. I think there are a lot of things happening here. Most are cultural, in my experience. Food tends to be part of everything families do together, and tend to be the older generations way of loving their relatives. In my experience, there is also a distorted view of a healthy weight (not in any way l, shape, or form saying AlL hIsPaNiCs ArE fAt). When I was 165 at 5‚Äô6‚Äù (my highest weight ever) everyone in my family thought I was THIN. When I got down to 140, the cacophony of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too thin‚Äù ‚Äústop dieting you‚Äôre going to make yourself sick‚Äù ‚Äúyou have an eating disorder‚Äù started from EVERYONE in my family. When I hit my comfy weight, where I don‚Äôt have to try, of 120 the ‚Äúomg you need to eat‚Äù ‚Äúomg your eating disorder is out of control‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not attractive, why are you doing this to yourself‚Äù and so on started, and frankly, hasn‚Äôt let up. 

So I feel like 1. Your mom may be struggling with the unity of food. In my family parties, weddings, birthdays, sporting events, a trip shopping, a doctors appointment, etc all center around food, and a lot of times alcohol. This will be the hardest one to combat imo. Your mom may be feeling like you‚Äôre rejecting her love. 
2.	She may legitimately feel like you are harming yourself, but more likely your actions are an internal, for her, reflection of herself. I‚Äôm making an assumption, but I‚Äôm guessing she isn‚Äôt a healthy weight, and you losing is making her feel bad about herself. 
3.	My entire family, and their contemporaries are not healthy weights, so me being, albeit on the thinner side of normal, is skeletal based on their perspectives. This is easily observed by their comments. 
4.	Traditional Mexican food tastes fucking amazing, and in a lot of instances is very calorie dense. Portions also tend to lean toward multiple days worth of calories. With no frame of reference on what a reasonable meal looks like, it‚Äôs hard to understand. Idk how to fix this one, but just keep doing your thing. It‚Äôs obviously working, so keep it up. 
5.	I also feel like older generations were never educated about a healthy diet. I‚Äôm 40, and I can‚Äôt think of a time in my life where anyone, that I personally knew, could honestly tell me what a healthy diet should look like. They also didn‚Äôt have to deal with all the shit being loaded into their foods (example, why is there sugar in tomato/pasta sauce), so what may have once been a relatively ok food is now a fat/sugar/salt/calorie bomb.

Secondly, the ""brand restrictions"" are rather common thing with dieticians. Mostly when we talk about guiding a patient with health problems, though, opposed to simple weight loss. If your concern is weight there is no need to eat only certain brands of products. But it easier for a dietician to calculate nutritional information with brand restrictions.

Last but not the least - ditch that dietician. The plan seems like something I would never throw at my client. Your calorie intake for an unsupported (medically, I mean) weight loss should not be lower than 2000 with that weight. 
My recommendation - If you don't have sugar addiction: It should be easy enough to lose weight at 2400 a day, no sugary drinks, no additional sugar, maximum of two servings of desserts per week, 4 meals a day. Replace(if possible) any white bread with grain one, at least a quarter of each meal should be vegetables, fruit or berries. Maximum of 300 grams of fruit and berries per day.
If addicted to sugar: 5 meal per day, sugar is allowed  every other day up to 15 grams per day( sugar added  to preprepared food does not count in it, but it would do wonders if you are aware of it and try to consume less of such foods).
And lots of pure water/unsweetened teas. Coffee only in the first half of the day, up to to cups.( It has a nasty tendency to screw metabolism over in overweight people).

IMPORTAINT NOTE: if you have any health concerns consult a doctor. Do not attempt to lover you calorie intake too much. You can have increased fatigue and lightheadness episodes the first week on no sugar diet, it common and it's normal.

Healthy weight loss is 1-3 lbs a week.
Rule of thumb is that you will gain weight back as quickly as you lose it, so rapid weight loss is not great and you will yo-yo *hard*.

Granted, someone your size will likely drop weight quite fast at first, which is normal. But the diet as described here will be an extremely unhealthy weight loss.

With my expertise of being a stranger on the internet, my biggest suggestion is to start small so you can sustain the changes.

Start with one or two small things:
- Take walks (daily if possible), even if it‚Äôs 10 minutes or less. The most important part is just you going outside.
- Add in a fruit and/or vegetable to your usual foods. E.g. slice up an apple or have a banana for a quick snack / throw in broccoli and/or carrots into a recipe, or rice some cauliflower to mix in with rice or substitute if you‚Äôre feeling daring.

Small things are sustainable. Once you‚Äôve more naturally formed a habit of those things, or they‚Äôre just easier for you to manage, you can add on doing one or two more small things, and so on.

My dietician straight up told me they couldn't come up with something accurate for me because of my size and the fact that I was still athletic, but thats beside the point. Here is what I did to become successful at losing.

First, hit the gym. Take 4 days a week and set a plan. It doesn't have to be crazy, but you have to move. No, just walking here and there or tracking steps isn't enough. It's better than nothing, but trust me on this one. It's a game changer.

Second, diet. I went with 5 meals a day, but smaller things.

Breakfast - 6 egg whites and 1 yolk, then some fruit. I like an apple, some grapes, blueberries, whatever. Protein in the morning is important for satiated.

Around 10am I had number 2 - overnight oats. It was a mix of oats and yogurt with fruit. You can look up recipes. Good overall satiating food that isn't crazy on calories. It's tasty too.

Lunch - salad. I know, but you can add any veggies you like and whatever dressing as long as you don't make it swim. It's important to get in greens.

At 3:30 - protein smoothie. 2 scoops of your favorite powder with 3/4 cup of almond milk, 3/4 cup frozen mixed fruit, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and mix. Delicious and good protein.

Finally dinner - chicken and rice with a side. It's not glamorous, but it's high protein and low calorie. You don't need to do this every day though. If I don't want to cook I often get subway. Some days I like Chinese food which isn't horrible as long as it's not abused.

Finally, cheat meal. One meal a week do what you want. Have pizza, or ice cream for dinner. Just learn to not over eat. Just because it's on the plate doesn't mean you need to eat it.

The absolute biggest thing for me was to learn that I didn't have to be so strict. If you have a special occasion, have some food. It's fine. Just learn to not eat too much and be conscious of it.

One last note, if you drink pop you need to stop. Liquid calories are ridiculous. Drink just water. If you don't like it, use mio or something to flavor it. Thats massive.

Oh, and supplements. Take vitamins. I take b, c, d, zinc, magnesium, calcium, and fish oil. It will help energy and sleep, along with mood.

Eh, fine, that's one way to cut calories, I guess.

I tend to agree on this. The word ""cheat"" has a lot of negative connotations that I don't want associated with how I live my life. So I don't do cheat days or cheat meals. Things either fit into my calories for the day or they don't. I've just done this for long enough that I know how to fit things that are relatively high in calories and low in nutrients into my calories for the day. What do you mean by cheat meals, anyway? Do you mean two slices of pizza, or do you mean two pizzas?

>I am a 29 year old 6‚Äô7‚Äù male at almost 400lbs.

At the risk of being of being blunt and/or slightly rude, you didn't get to your current weight eating reasonable portions of stuff. I'm not keen on her suggested serving sizes on the grains and the beans, but other than that, this is really a remarkably healthy meal plan, and if you went right to the ""no more than _____"" max of each of these, you could get up to around 2000 calories, possibly a little bit more. It's definitely more than I eat, and I'm a woman less than half your size, so unless she's running marathons, this isn't a copy/paste of her own meal plan; this actually does look like a pretty decent plan for a man who is at risk of dying young if he doesn't lose a good amount of weight. 

If you were able to lose weight on your own by using an app such as My Fitness Pal or Lose It in conjunction with a food scale, I suspect you would have done so without seeing a dietician.

t1g4ht,hyh2lc6,t3_t1g4ht,"I think the thing she overlooked is that you need to *learn* how to eat better.  You're not going to do that by making a giant change all at once, and risk giving up.  I have lost 20 pounds since Sept 3, 2021, and I'm using Cronometer.  Looking at my early entries, I can see how off base I was in terms of what calories and nutrients various foods had.  

What worked, though, was to keep researching the foods I ate, eating better of those foods, and not really cutting anything out of my diet.  Instead, I ate X instead of Y.  Dark chocolate rather than Kit Kats.  Small amount of nuts rather than potato chips.  Vegetables with seasoning rather than cheese sauce.  That sort of thing.  You may find that ""healthy"" foods need to be tweaked.  I kept getting advice to eat plain yogurt with granola, and wow, every day I tried that I went WAY over my calorie allotment because it was high calorie and also triggered cravings like crazy.

Over time, you'll figure out what triggers you to eat more.  I tend to eat those, when I'm really craving them, as late in the day as is practical.

As you dial it in, you may need to allot yourself more calories, or you may be able to cut calories a bit more.  You'll find what foods are really delicious and satisfying without feeling like ""diet food"".

Cronometer calculates your TDEE for you, which is helpful.  It's also really easy to update your weight.

The last suggestion I have is to think hard about how strictly you need to meet your calorie goal, and keep a log.  I'm a little loose with my measuring because I don't want this to become so burdensome that I quit.  So, on a day when I'm at or below my target calorie intake, I give myself 5 stars, and fewer stars based on how far over I am.

This can't be too hard, or it's too easy to quit.  For people who enjoy measuring things to the calorie, great, you do you.  But for people like me, who really dislike counting calories, getting the food entered with my best estimate is as strict as I'm willing to be.

You could eat anywhere under that and lose weight. My advice is to eat 3000 and cut down to 2500 in 3-6 months.
*  Swimming or yoga will be the best exercise, since your joints are probably stressed.

Do you weigh your food and use an app to track calories like myfitnesspal or Carb Manager? Are you counting a tablespoon of creamer or cooking oil when used? 

Have you considered back down on calories for a few week? Start with 100 a day and see how you feel. I know I‚Äôve had to make adjustments to my recommended calories from a TDEE calc to balance hunger and weight loss.

Do a check in on your cheat days. How much are you actually eating on those days? If you‚Äôre aiming to lose 1 lb a week you have to burn 3,500 calories. If your cheat day is multiple high calorie meals in one day, that cheat day could be destroying your whole week.

If it‚Äôs a marathon and not a sprint‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll, I don‚Äôt want to go 6 months without tasting a single glass of red wine, so every 4-6 weeks I get a glass or two.

Firstly good for you for working out, you'll be MUCH healthier for it in the end than someone who only concerns themselves with diet.

You can do this, weight loss basically boils down to two things mechanically: calories in vs calories out, and consistency.

Having some structure. I do practice intermittent fasting, so for me no breakfast and no snacking. I aim to get all my food inside a small meal and a large meal. But snacking was one of the biggest problems for me, I would boredom snack a lot previously. During the week those meals also tend to be pretty utilitarian. I'll cook one main dish and then a big batches of chicken, steel cut oats, and veggies on the weekend and eat off that at least one of those meals every day. But even if I do have say brunch with friends on the weekend, I have a rough idea always of what the rest of my eating for the day looks like.

Having some activity. For me that's focused on strength training. While I haven't throw on tons of muscle in the deficit, it does seem like adding/maintaining some muscle has meant that I haven't needed to adjust how much I'm eating that much. More muscle is more resting metabolism. But I also have an active dog to run around with and go on hikes on the weekend.

Having some specific restrictions. I try to keep any kind of treat meal to once or twice a week, as well as buying a favorite bag of candy once a week. And I'll usually allow myself only the occasional diet soda now. As mentioned above, I do sub complex carbs for simple ones as much as possible - whole grain bread instead of white bread, brown rice for white rice, and such.

And in general, just try to be mindful of how much I'm portioning and slow down a bit when eating.

>every online calculator says I should be at 3200 for maintenance

You're overestimating your activity level, I would guess. I plugged your stats in at tdeecalculator.net, and I get 3200 for maintenance at Moderately Active. Weight lifting doesn't burn a lot of calories as compared to cardio, so that might be one issue. You might want to get a body fat estimate and plug that in, such that it'll switch from the Mifflin-St. Jeor Formula the Katch-McArdle Formula; it's a bit more accurate. 

Alternatively, you could get an app such as Adaptive TDEE Calculator and use it to get your actual TDEE based on your calorie intake and weight data; the online calculators aren't really calculators, as such; they provide a decent estimate based on population parameters, but your actual TDEE may be higher or lower than the number it provides. Use a food scale, if you don't already, by the way - the better the calorie data you give that app, the more accurate your TDEE calculation will be.

My first advice is not trying to rush to an extreme. It will only aggravate the problem. Calm and patience paramount.

Secondly, you'd be surprised at how simple changes have a very impactful effect in the long run. It can be as simple as replacing candy by fruit or going for a 30 minute walk. If you're coming from zero, everything is improvement.

If you have no problems with that, I'd recommend buying a kitchen scale if you don't have one and weighing everything you eat. Apps like MyFitnessPal are your friends.

Vegan food isn‚Äôt per se healthier or lighter than omni food especially now that you can find so many processed meat analogs, including at fast food places. You‚Äôre going to have to try one of the following, or some combination of:

1.	Restricting the type of food you eat: focusing on whole foods that offer a lot of volume for the calories. Minimizing calorie dense food like nuts and oils. Cutting added sugar out almost entirely. Cutting alcohol. Basically a whole foods plant based diet. 
2.	Restricting the frequency of eating: eat at mealtimes and restrict or eliminate snacking. It‚Äôs really hard to lose weight if you just graze all day and don‚Äôt account for it. Examples of this kind of dieting are intermittent fasting (eating within a restricted time window) or the No S diet (cutting out snacks and desserts).

Finally, some of them are badges you can earn over the course of a month (i.e., 300k steps in a month; 91 miles of walking during a month).

These things are what got me into running.

The onset of her illness coincided with my \~30 lb. weight loss. I was able to maintain for most of the time I was taking care of her (probably from stress, not from healthy eating habits), but I've put on about 10 lbs since she passed. 

Part of me was like, whatever: I am grieving, deeply sad and exhausted and I just need to be forgiving of myself. And I was, mostly. But I also fear undoing all of the progress I made, and frankly, the combination of grieving AND dealing with significant weight gain is not something I can handle.

I began to focus not necessarily on getting back to my ideal way of eating, but on ordering out less, not grazing at night - easier things to cut out that make a big difference. I'm trying to cook at home more, but still make things that feel indulgent. So kind of inching back to my ideal CICO plan.

Instead I encourage you to focus instead on other things-- hobbies, career transitions, exploring new places, new foods even, anything at all to keep your mind OFF of trying to regain control.

t1nt60,hyihk12,t3_t1nt60,"I'm a former chronic insomniac and I have been through exactly what you're describing, including the digestion discomfort. This is going to sound crazy, but I swear this helped my insomnia a ton--are you on oral contraceptives? The ones I was on were upsetting my stomach more than I realized, as well as causing migraines. Once I went off them in favor of an IUD, I started sleeping so much easier and having less stomach issues. It seems to me that my lack of sleep was at least partly caused by just digestion discomfort, but maybe also the hormones in the pill were causing something too.

I'd say treating the stress is the most important thing to get you on the right path, but of course that's not always possible for people. But it's worth taking a look at the specific things that stress you out most and seeing if you can cut any of them out. For example, I had a particular friend who was always giving me passive aggressive comments that I'd seethe over for weeks. Eventually cutting off contact with her reduced my stress levels a lot. I couldn't do much about some of my other stressors, but at least this was one way to help!

Lack of sleep absolutely messes with your emotions and makes stress more difficult to handle, and thus makes it even harder to sleep! I had way more mood fluctuations when I wasn't getting enough sleep. It also messes with your hormones, specifically the ones that make you feel hunger. If you're anything like me, it's also probably that much more difficult to work out or just move your body effectively because you're always so damned tired. I'm sorry you're suffering through this.

I know you said you've tried everything, but a few other things that helped me were: always going to bed at the same time, removing all lights from my room (things like alarm clocks that stay on always), room darkening curtains, white noise of some kind (we use an air purifier), a cool room at night, a warm shower before bed, stop drinking anything 3 hours before bedtime, and no food 3 hours before bedtime. I still adhere to all of this and if I stop for a night or two, the insomnia comes back. But I haven't had to rely on sleeping pills, at least.

I'm a SAHM so I don't have work or school, but taking care of the house is a whole workout and don't get me started on how utterly exhausting 2 toddlers who are teething and/or experiencing growing pains. I feel like I get nothing done, until my husband points out exactly what all I've gotten done.

My weightloss is somewhat slow, a little under 10 lbs down in 2 months, but practicing better breathing and calming myself before panic sets in helps a lot. Also find a fun form of exercise that also helps you let out some steam (in the beforefore, wii sports resort's sword fighting stuff was my go to. Now it's just dance. Finding that sort of golden activity is vital imo.

Something that has helped me with stomach issues is realizing I'm basically allergic to a TON of foods. I'm talking ""I don't know if I can eat this banana or not, my mouth feels really itchy"" levels. I've also developed new food allergies over time. On top of that, gaining a bit of control over my adhd has helped a lot with stress, since I'm not overwhelmed and overreacting to everything.

I used to have insomnia as well... but what fixed mine was my toddlers when they were newborns, so I'm pretty sure that's not a great strategy for insomnia treatment. Something that also helped was no longer doing anything in my bed that isn't sleep. No reading, no phone, no gaming, no eating. This makes your brain associate bed with sleep instead of recreation. But that's something that helps slowly overtime and doesn't usually get immediate results.

A few other quick things that helped my insomnia: not eating after 2 hours before bedtime. I.e. if you go to bed at 10, eat and drink nothing but water after 8 pm. Staying hydrated is also helpful. For me, a gallon a day of water is the goal, but that's based on my own weight (274 lbs). Alao not taking in caffeine after 2pm helped a bit.

But again, the things that helped me the most was getting adhd treatment, and having Irish twins. I recommend the first, especially if you research adhd and see yourself experiencing similar things all the time or have already been diagnosed. But the latter? Meh. I don't recommend having kids as a treatment for any mental or medical problems. But it's a potential bonus if you wanted to have kids anyway.

t0mndt,hyay5tv,t3_t0mndt,"I am so sorry you‚Äôre hurting right now. I also struggle with body image issues. Always have. No matter when my weight was up, down, all around I was insecure about something (or a lot of things). One thing that has always troubled me was my lower stomach. I carried most of weight there at my heaviest, and at my smallest that was still where I carried weight, but now my skin was ‚Äúsaggy‚Äù and in an apron shape and covered in stretch marks. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm come to learn to make me feel a little better:

1.) no matter what my body looked like, it was healthier. It was stronger. There was less excess fat to give me health issues. I didn‚Äôt get out of breath as easily as I did when I was heavier. I had a skill set I was proud of and constantly improved on. Exercise was a hobby, a lifestyle, and improved my mental health as well as my physical. There were a lot of reasons why I loved my new body and my new life outside of its appearance. 
2.) clothes fit me so much better. I could wear more styles that flattered me smaller than when I was bigger. I could shop at more stores. I remember struggling to find a prom dress in high school because of my size. I‚Äôll always remember how elated I was to finally find that one dress that was left in my size and how gorgeous it was. 
3.) I realized, ‚ÄúYou know what? I DO look good.‚Äù Did I look like a Victoria‚Äôs Secret Angel? Shoot,
no! And I never would. But this was the body of someone who worked hard to improve their health and lifestyle. I was proud of it. I adorned it in clothes that flattered my body type and covered the bits I didn‚Äôt want to show off, but displayed the ones I loved in a classy way.
 4.) There‚Äôs gotta be something you love about yourself. Maybe you have strong glutes you‚Äôve worked on over time, a cinched waist, long legs, whatever it may be. You‚Äôre looking at the parts you hate but neglecting to see the parts that people would kill for. And there‚Äôs something on you they would. No body is ‚Äúperfect‚Äù (literally no one‚Äôs; that‚Äôs why photoshop and angles exist). There‚Äôs something there that makes you confident and people compliment you on. I would focus on those things. Next time you have that thought, ‚ÄúI hate my stomach,‚Äù follow it up with ‚Äú‚Ä¶but I love my back and it looks so good in a spaghetti strap dress.‚Äù Google body shapes for women and find yours. There‚Äôs a lot of guides that will tell you what styles are flattering and what aren‚Äôt. And another thing, comparison is the thief of joy. Who says you shouldn‚Äôt look the way you do? Maybe you had an expectation in mind of how you‚Äôd look. But that‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs body. Ask yourself how you can be the best version of yourself, not look like anyone else. You can DM if you ever want to talk or vent about it because I‚Äôm right there with you. I was in the best shape of my life, got pregnant, worked out most of my pregnancy, then got hit with anemia and sickness at the end and gained a lot more than I needed to. I‚Äôm struggling to love my body and I know once I get to where I want to weight wise I‚Äôm going to have a body that grew and birthed two humans and it‚Äôs going to look it even if it‚Äôs skinny. Our bodies are vessels for our souls and I‚Äôm proud of how strong it is and how it takes care of me. My body loves me and it‚Äôs hard and I have my days, but I‚Äôm going to accept it whatever it looks like and appreciate it back the best I can by taking care of it.",699,0,2,False,False,False,1645742147.0

Continue to take collagen, build muscle, and drink water, along with lotioning daily and exfoliating regularly.

You're in a bad mental space now, but don't get stuck there. Where there's a will, there's a way. After maintaining for a while, you might not need surgery in some places. You could also be covered for it from your insurance if there's so much that it's a medical necessity.

3. Look into surgery, yes some loose skin bounces back, but not all. Your boobs won‚Äôt magically lift and become full out of thin air, not will your stomach tighten to the point where you never were overweight. However I‚Äôm saying this it doesn‚Äôt mean give up on hope. Like a girl on TikTok said it the best ‚Äúyou can always pay for new ones‚Äù

I know the surgeries for loose skin removal are a luxury because of price but I urge you to at least look into them and start saving.

Victoria Secrets bras are amazing for giving my  breasts shape.

STS Blue jeans have at of stretch but have been the best fitting jeans I've  found. They hold everything in nice and smooth and are so comfortable. They really give me a boost with how they fit my body.

Stitchfix has been really wonderful for me to fund clothing that fits my new body. I  don't  have to expose myself to harsh lighting and to a lack of options in the store. Plus you can really hone down what makes you look and feel great.

When I look in the mirror I see that my breasts although  not as full as they once were stick out more than my tummy does. I see that my love handles are almost gone. I see that I can watch my muscles move under my skin. I see a little hollow in my collar bones that I never had.

My body is not what I wanted it too be but I try to find little things I feel good about and I hope you can do that too. It really helps to find those small victories.

I haven‚Äôt lost the weight yet but I know this will happen to me. Everyone says to love your body as is but I don‚Äôt think any amount of therapy would ever convince me I can do that when I will always carry around the evidence of my weight loss journey. To me that‚Äôs lying to to yourself rather than an act of self love.

BUT I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of life coaches talk about weight loss and thoughts. You don‚Äôt have to think this way. You can retrain your brain into loving and accepting yourself. You may have a bad view of your body right now but you don‚Äôt always have to think that way. This is your life, you decide how you spend it and how you want to feel about it.

I too have looked in the mirror and thought I look like a deformed monster. I use to have boobs and be more a pretty thick girl..now I'm about as flat chested as a 12 year old boy. Most days I don't even wear a bra anymore because there is no point. The saggy skin on my belly hides the muscles underneath and the stretch marks on my legs tell of how fat I use to be.

But despite the flaws I know that I feel alot better than I did at my heaviest. I do crossfit 4-5 times a week and am constantly getting stronger and able to do. I know that I am likely going to live longer and age better than those who are still overweight. 

Other people, the ones ""we lost weight for"" the boys, social media, or our inner pride can f#$k off. Understand that what we see online is so airbrushed and fake..I too would look like a top model if I had unlimited budget, professional make up and editing. If someone in your life cares about your saggy skin of stretch marks cut them out of your life. I met my boyfriend at 150lb,  he's seen me loose weight and gain saggy skin. I worried he would no longer be physically attracted to me, and that has not happened at all. He in fact says one the most impressive things is I lost 90lb on my own by working hard, and the loose skin is just like a battle scar, wear it with pride that it was a hard but good fight you won. 

It gets better, overtime your mind will accept it. Don't spend hours in front a mirror picking yourself apart. I am often caught off guard by photos taken of me because I look so small and good in them.

Thankfully, as a society we tend to do what others around us are doing (very generally). So if you stay on your path and progress through your own body transformation, she will likely follow suit.

Also all body transformation benefit for being done in tandem with a therapist as some of our motivators will not change regardless of what we weigh. Therapy gives us the tools to manage criticism of our approach to our ideals and the creation of our ideals from both within our heads and from external actors.

What I would do in this situation is clear your head, and become incredibly conscious of all the ways that you are feeling superior to her. You need to squash that smug feeling entirely if you want to have any hope of getting through. 

Two things that won‚Äôt be super helpful but wouldn‚Äôt be terrible either: 

- start hanging out when running errands. Grocery store, mall, or even walking at the park. The idea here is less couch hangouts and more just walking. There needs to be a point to doing the exercise, and she will likely realize she‚Äôs having trouble breathing more if she‚Äôs got someone to compare to. But it cannot seem like that‚Äôs the point. There needs to be a real REASON why you‚Äôre walking, like for instance you want to buy a new dress at the mall and can‚Äôt find the right one, or you need groceries. Stuff like that. Resist all temptation to make comments about why you‚Äôre eating what you do. Don‚Äôt mention your new size when shopping either. 

- if you guys eat out a lot, start going to places that are healthier or encourage healthier choices. Mediterranean food is great for this, so are salad bars or sushi places. This will have a positive side effect of making her realize that you can still enjoy food even while making healthier choices. But don‚Äôt mention that it‚Äôs healthier when you do this. 

These two things are small but may help her get the ball rolling. Recognize that it‚Äôs likely shame that‚Äôs keeping her from being able to help herself‚Ä¶ and making little comments about food choices or exercise or whatever will likely only compound her shame. Resist at all costs, keep focusing on yourself, love her with open arms. She either will come to the same conclusion you did or she won‚Äôt. Putting her into the world, though, will make her see even if she doesn‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs infinitely better to come to this conclusion yourself than to have a friend try and shove it down your throat.

Let her know I am here to help in whatever capacity she asks from me. And then I'd finish by saying that I also understand if that's not something she wants. Tell her that she can tell me to drop it and I won't bring it up again but that the offer will always be there. And then listen to whatever her response it. 

That's what I would do at least. I have lost friends to the HAES movement, friends who became angry that I pulled myself out of obesity and felt judged without me ever saying anything at all.

t1bk0g,hyezwy4,t3_t1bk0g,"In nearly all of these situations the culprit is either that you have overestimated your TDEE or that you are unwittingly tracking incorrectly.

  
To track accurately, every single thing you put in your body needs to be accurately identified, measured by weight on a scale, and recorded with a reliable tracker.  
People make mistakes like: 

*  Measuring by volume instead of weight
* Guessing something is a lower calorie version that what it actually is
* Neglecting to track things they think are inconsequential (like an extra pour of olive oil while cooking)  


For TDEE, people usually make the mistake of believing that just because they work out daily for 40-60 minutes, that they are more active than they are. I spend nearly my entire day sitting down. I am sedentary, without a doubt. Since there is no reliable way to accurately measure your output, it is always best to err on the side of caution and choose sedentary when calculating your TDEE.
