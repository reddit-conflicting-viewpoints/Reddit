There are really just two main sections to this song the verse and the chorus. The verse only uses two chords, but over those two chords Andy Summers plays this really cool double-stop guitar part that also uses a technique called palm-muting.

Then when they launch into the chorus Summers continues his guitar part with just a little single-note riff that repeats over and over throughout the chorus.

It's super catchy and so fun to play!

But on the version I heard on the radio, however, his verse wasnt there! I've seen this happen to a few other songs that were popular years ago that had a rapper do a verse but years later it's not there anymore. Some of the verses wouldn't even be that bad to censor on the radio.

Does anyone know why this happens? Does the artist that collaborated with the rapper not want to be associated with them anymore? Is it something to do with a contract? I'm very curious.",1644531518.0

spalek,Artists/bands whose style changed so drastically one wouldn't have recognized them anymore,0,0.33,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/spalek/artistsbands_whose_style_changed_so_drastically/,11,"Best example in my opinion would be Fleetwood Mac.

They begin as one of the many bands of the British blues movement, their original singer and guitarist Peter Green also was one of the many members of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers; their sound however was a bit more dry and less mainstream and psychedelic than the one of Cream or the Jimi Hendrix Experience. A bit like early Led Zeppelin. It was in a bit of a middle of the black blues from the States of John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters and the mainstream hard rock of the Who and the Rolling Stones. Typical were songs like 'Black Magic Woman' and 'Stop Messin Around'. A huge exception was the melodic instrumental 'Albatross' which gave the blues a bit more melodic sound. Thank you, Peter Green :)

After Green left the band, Jeremy and Christine came and while the blues didn't disappear, the sound became softer, yeah, it would turn into soft rock, but not THE soft rock we'd hear later, it would rather border into folk rock. Over the years, the two Bobs - Welch and Weston - would join the band, as well as Dave Weston, who would provide vocals for one of the most unorthodox FM songs in my humble opinion: 'The Derelict'. Even then already blues rock was no longer their main sound, but it wasn't gone either, see songs like 'The City'"". Then, Walker and both Bobs left the band also. Left were only the two men who were responsible for the band to exist in the first place: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie.

And then, the era we all know began. With Lindsey and Nickie. Which also lead into the mainstream rock sound of the 1980's. Hard to find similarities between those many phases. Only the drummer and bassist have always remained the same. Now Lindsey's gone too, and former Crowded House front singer Neil Finn took his place.

Talking about that, Neil Finn also went through lots of changes. Started of in an all Kiwi band, Split Enz, at first an art rock band, but then brought post-punk into the music. Neil's older brother Brian Timothy was the vocalist, but eventually they decided to let Neil sing. And in 1980 their most well known album 'True Colors' (which I happen to own) came out and despite being very punky, the band now was shifting into a clear New Wave sound, which then would continue with Crowded House's debut album. However, even here we already had signs of the future alternative rock sound, best example being the US hit 'Something So Strong' (which sounds strongly like an R.E.M. song if y'all ask me!). And they also would eventually make journeys into funk ('Chocolate Cake')  and jazz ('Sister Madly'). And I believe it was worth it. Tim BTW also played gutiar for the 'Woodface' album.

Similarly are Jefferson Airplane, Jefferston Starship and Starship. Three bands or one? Hard to say in my opinion. The female lead singer has always remained the same. Just that the first band was a psychedelic rock band with their greatest hits 'Somebody Love' and 'White Rabbit'. A typical two hit wonder at first. But then it bordered into a new band that would remain the psychedelic rock sound in some sense, but made it more 70's ish and more melodic. And finally, Starship with Mickey Thomas as the new male voice, leading into songs like 'Sara', 'We Built This City' and 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'. Now the psychedelic influences were gone entirely, they played the typical adult oriented arena rock sound. But the female voice had never changed.

And of course, a lot more important, Genesis. Started off as a Beatles ripoff, before Steve Hackett and Phil Collins joined the band and made them prog. I sadly only own 'Selling England By The Pound', but that one is perhaps one of the more underrated prog albums. But then Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett left the band 'And Then They Were Three'. They just became your average pop rock band. Not horrible, but nothing special. Phil certainly was better on vocals solo than he was with Genesis. He made Genesis what it was from 'Nursery Cryme' on, and even the first two albums with him as a vocalist were still prog, but with Hackett's departure everything ended, and what came out was what we all heard from the Top 40 stations.

Just like Phil Collins recorded several solo albums, Mike Rutherford made his own band with Mike & the Mechanics and the two Pauls, Carrack (IMHO a strongly underrated vocalist, we also known him as the vocalist of Ace's 'How Long' and Squeeze's 'Tempted') and Young (not to be confused with the other Paul Young, ironically, Paul Carrack sang in duet with that one too) and landed a couple hits also. While Tony Banks however happened to prefer the prog sound on his solo albums, Peter Gabriel made his own pop sound different from the pop sound everyone else was making and Steve Hackett decided to experience classical. And on their final studio album... well, Ray Wilson of Stiltskin took the mic and gave them yet another 'new' sound.

Also Gary Moore, perhaps one of my favorites, comes to my mind. He first played in an own band that played bit of a jazz rock sound. Then he joined Thin Lizzy, and made his first solo album in a traditional hard rock sound. And that debute album already contained 'Parisienne Walkways' (with Phil from Thin Lizzy in the lead vocals). It was a bit of a foreshadowing, but would not define his sound of the 1980's. Instead, he'd play heavy metal, but with more influences of the stadium rock of the time, actually, in many songs he would sound like Steve Perry from Journey! (at least in my opinion, 'Empty Rooms' would be such an example) But after he released yet another hard rock/heavy metal album with 'After The War' in 89, just one year later the sound changed entirely and he now fully committed to blues rock. Not even the voice would suggest that it was the same man. In my opinion, this album gave blues rock a bit of a new sound. So far, Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler had defined the sound with their typical countryish riffs, but Gary looked at his role model BB King and decided to add some horns, which would also be a great inspiration for Joe Bonamassa, and in general, I wish there was more of that style. Guys like Jeff Healey, Stevie Ray Vaughn or Rory Gallagher were the definition for the American side of blues rock, and Gary obviously was not American, but he had little inspiration from the British or Irish side, so he developed his very own sound. It was surprisingly melodic, best example are of course 'Still Got The Blues' as well as 'Midnight Blues', 'Story of the Blues', 'Seperate Ways' and so on. However, later he would return to his hard rock style with a bit more electric sound. But his life showed that the blues was all he ever wanted :)

Let me start with the elephant in the room, Bohemian Rhapsody.
This song is an absolute masterpiece, a true stroke of genius from Freddie, Brian, John and Roger.
The guitar solo flows so well into the operatic section, and the high note at the end of that section, is truly impeccable. The reflection at the end of the song leaves a satisfying end.

I Am In Love With My Car's lyrics are quite strange but the beat and backround music is smooth and seamless.

You Are My Best Friend's lyrics are very catchy and a good song to sing along to, and the best at the beggining feels satisfying and sentimental, allowing room for happy lyrics.

sp5yqg,How music is come in our life,0,0.29,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sp5yqg/how_music_is_come_in_our_life/,1," Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm and timbre. It is one of the universal cultural aspects of human societies. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques,¬† ranging from singing to rapping and many more things. Music is¬† a commendable thing. I love singing also. 

 

**Art and Entertainment**

Music is composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious ceremony or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was available in sheet music scores such as in the classical and romantic era,¬† music lovers were buying¬† the sheet music of their favorite songs and perform them at home on the piano.

With the advent of tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the¬† 1990s,¬† music lovers could tape a¬† playlist of their favorite songs and take them on a portable cassette. ¬†People learn music from institutions or by the help of internet. In the past internet was not there so people gone to music school to learn music,¬† and they started with basic things. Music is like anything,¬† we can feel it and enjoy it. Music is also give happiness and put beautiful smile on their face. Amateur musicians can compose music at their pace. Composers do so much hard work for making one music. Music is the best thing.

Anyway here's 5 from me. 

The love language - S/T. This album is so fun and just good from front to back,  it's thoughtful, poppy, catchy and fun indie rock and it deserves a listen. 

Grampall Jookabox - Ropechain. I'll be honest I like their first album better but it's not attitude as approachable and this had a wider appeal, but it's pure danceable psychedelic wonder and one time I did mushrooms and listened to this in 2 drives while eating ice cream sandwiches and everything was perfect for a bit. 

Margot and the nuclear so & so's - The dust of retreat.  This album is peak Midwest sad kid dreamy indie rock. It's loud when it needs to be and sad when it needs to be,  playful and thoughtful.  They're are like 5 follow-ups and solo work but this is my favorite still. 

Dear and the headlights - Small steps heavy hooves.  They're just so hard to describe but also so flawless, it's like 90's college rock with indie folk and a dash of good humor and imagination.  I just fucking love it.

Caroline Rose - Loner. The most recent entry but so so good.  Just pure fun loving powerpop from a gal that started in country or adjacent music for a few years and then seemingly figured herself out and went all in. Memorable synth layers,  no fat and at least 3 absolute bangers.

The last time I told them was a few years ago and they laughed in my face so I had to play it off as a joke because it was so embarrassing. 

I‚Äôve been playing the piano since I was about 7 and then realised I actually wanted to seriously go into music at about 13. The only problem is my parents. Like I understand that I don‚Äôt come from a musical family and my voice isn‚Äôt exactly the greatest voice in the world but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs bad, so I just don‚Äôt understand why they have a problem with it. 

They want me to be a scientist (I‚Äôm failing science at school btw), but I just really don‚Äôt feel myself in science. I want a job where I can express myself and a job in the music industry is exactly that. I know making it in music is hard nowadays especially if you‚Äôre not that talented, but it‚Äôs not impossible, especially since I live in the UK and speak multiple languages which are all massive advantages. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know that they care about me and just want me to have a secure life but honestly, I‚Äôd rather be not so rich doing the job I love than drowning in money but being completely fucking miserable in what I‚Äôm doing.

Mine Is Yours ‚Äì Cold War Kids

Much of the content here deals with personal growth, and some of the more uplifting lyrics have me on the verge of tears:

>It feels so strange to feel good  
And when I was the fire you were wood  
So when I was petrified  
You understood

>I have been broken open  
This was not my master plan  
I was comfortable watching from the stands  
I have been broken open  
>  
>All my edges are exposed  
I was once content alone  
Now you are the one that I call home  
I've been broken open

The way they examine coming out of your shell and finally having confidence in yourself just hits so close to home.

&#x200B;

Go Farther In Lightness ‚Äì Gang of Youths

Namely ""The Heart Is a Muscle,"" an exploration of getting yourself back out there after repeatedly having your heart broken.

>There will be no years of silence in the shadow of regret  
I won't let it so betray me, though my soul got used to it  
I will look at love as more than just an instrument of pain  
And will give myself completely to the moving and the strange

>I will not play this out discreetly, it is real and unashamed

1. You stay with a huge percentage of what you sell. It doesn't work with underpaid streams.
2. Bandcamp allows you to make great promotions whenever you want.
3. It has cool features like connecting with your fans, selling merch, etc
4. It has a vynil press service
5. More cool stuff

Last month, amid a wave of artist boycotts, Spotify added content warnings to its COVID-19 content to quell anger at vaccine misinformation hosted on the platform. The tweak did little to satisfy critics, and the New York state comptroller is among them, according to a letter obtained by Reuters. 

In the letter, comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees pension funds in the state, urged Spotify to let users more easily report misinformation, and requested details on how the platform handles content rules and enforcement, according to Reuters. DiNapoli cited complaints that Joe Rogan had spread misinformation, as well as reports of racist material. 

‚ÄúAs we have seen with other technology and media companies who host or publish content, the failure to successfully moderate content on a company‚Äôs platforms can lead to various reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks,‚Äù DiNapoli wrote in the letter, sent February 2, according to Reuters.

For anybody curious, here‚Äôs some songs of theirs to introduce you:

The Nosebleed Section (my personal introduction to them),
Rattling the Keys to the Kingdom,
The Underground (my personal favorite track of theirs),
Brainbox,
Cosby Sweater,
Speaking in Tongues


Anybody who gives it a chance, I‚Äôd love to hear what you have to say.",1644417464.0

My older, tweenaged brother began listening to rock radio after he grew tired of '00s boy bands and top 40 hits. Naturally, I was going to follow my brother's musical tastes purely on the basis of exposure. Rock radio ruled my teens, exposing me to '80s hair metal, '90s grunge/post-grunge, and '90s-'00s nu-metal. Disturbed was, of course, a mainstay in those years. As middle schoolers we'd compete to see who could do the best ""OOO WA-AH-AH-AH"". I eventually found other (read: better) music, and transitioned out of this scene. By the time I left high school, I was fully immersed in albums and completely detached from the radio.

I ended my relationship with nu-metal nearly half my life ago, and it amazes me how many of these bands are still together, making the same sounds, 8+ albums in. That scene is still, evidently, raking in cash and it's not showing signs of stopping. Looking at the way culture persists since the mid-00s, this is sort of expected. The thing I wasn't expecting was that nu-metal would become so mainstream that it would become *mundane*. This leads me to the impetus behind this post:

# I heard Disturbed's cover of ""Sound of Silence"" in the grocery store the other day.

First, I need to address this particular cover of this particular song. Something that absolutely kills me is the need to make everything ""epic"" in this day and age. You take a serene, poignant, ambiguous protest song like ""Sound of Silence"" and you add distortion, a strong buildup, and David Draiman's signature vocals in some effort to make the song have more oomph, more power, to give it a new life or introduce it to a new generation. In my opinion, Disturbed's ""Sound of Silence"" is powerful in the way a 15-year-old would think it is. Perhaps the only thing I can be happy about regarding this cover is that it may introduce the original ""Sound of Silence"" to a new swath of 15-year-olds the same way seeing *Watchmen* in theaters introduced it to me.

Anyone who's listened to Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, or any MTV Unplugged concert knows that, sometimes, stripping a song down to its bare essentials brings out its beauty, and makes it more powerful. ""Sound of Silence"" is a brilliant song because of its stark instrumentation and its defiant, prophetic, and despairing lyrics. ""Sound of Silence"" is not supposed to be epic. Disturbed's cover is the definition of overdoing it when it comes to a song that's supposed to be quiet, haunting, and foreboding. 

Somehow, this cover has managed to eclipse all of Disturbed's discography. It's got more listens than ""Down with the Sickness"" on Spotify, and is within striking distance of having more listens than the original ""Sound of Silence"". Clearly this has struck a chord culturally, and it's actually impressive considering the song was released in 2015. Was it in some movie I didn't see? Was it played at sporting events? (I say this because I saw a teenager figure skating to it the other day in the Olympics.) Or was it pounded into mundanity by corporate overlords who decided it would be ripe to play in grocery stores?

Let's talk about *grocery store music*. It's important to remember that everyone inside of a grocery store is a captive audience to the corporate radio that plays there (unless they have earbuds in). Therefore, the assumption placed on this music is that it needs to be agreeable music for everyone and anyone. There's also the assumption that it will serve as appropriate background music (i.e. muzak) for your shopping. As a total music snob, I'd have to put these among the worst assumptions to be placed on a piece of music. Any artist would ask that their music be paid attention to, and even judged, regardless of the haters. But in a grocery store, you can't turn it off, and you can't turn it louder. You instead have to accept that the music will become a part of the store's predictable, expected, mundane ambiance.

I don't know how else to say this: if I deeply respect you as an artist or a band, then I most likely don't want to hear you in a store as agreeable, mundane background noise. This isn't to disparage soft rockers like John Mayer, or Tracy Chapman, or even Kenny G. They obviously didn't choose to have their music contextualized in this way. Still though, when I hear a song I like in a grocery store, I can't help but think ""You deserve better than this."" 

To wrap up, when I heard Disturbed's ""Sound of Silence"" in the grocery store a bunch of thoughts went through my head:

1. Wow, here in the year of our lord 2022, I've officially heard Disturbed in a grocery store.
2. I forgot this cover existed. I remember when Disturbed did that Genesis cover all those years ago and people were confused and ambivalent and I didn't even know it was a cover until like a year later. That's probably happening again right now.
3. ""Sound of Silence"" is such a beautiful song and this is such a shitty treatment of it.
4. Does anyone else see the irony in a song that's about people not communicating being played in a grocery store where people brush by each other avoiding eye contact? No? Just me?
5. Nu-metal has crossed the line from being the bumper music for traditionally masculine forms of content like blacksmithing videos and UFC fights, to being agreeable, grocery store-grade muzak.
6. This is a real step up in intensity from traditional grocery store soft rock. The vamp-up at the latter end of the cover is simply on a different dynamic level, and it's strange to hear it while I'm looking at toilet paper.
7. God I fucking hate this cover, and I can't turn it off. 
8. It'll probably play the next time I'm here.

Just wanted to give her channel a shout out, as she will likely grow into a very popular channel, but she currently only has 741 subscribers.

She plays livestreams every Thursday from her home, and often plays live at Bellevue Square Mall in Washington State.

She‚Äôs incredibly talented, especially with improvisation and composition. She plays solo piano in the style of Michael Gettel, George Winston, Tom Howard, Christopher Peacock, etc., with genres ranging from soft solo piano, jazz, popular showtunes, Disney classics, modern pop, and beyond.

Her best attribute in my opinion is the peace and tranquility of her music and playing, perfect for any needed moment of calm and relaxation.

The tingling along my back and neck kept reminding me, don't stand up. Under the back porch, a place tinged with danger and smelling of earth, the air tastes faintly of mold and hollyhocks twining around the trellises that I see only the bottoms of, speckled gold by the shafts of sun slipping through high elm branches in the backyard, weaving shadows like Grandma's lace dresser doilies.

When Spotify decided to ignore users protests and keep paying  big Joe Rogain 100 million dollars to be a dick, I decided to try Apple Music.  Turns out I didn‚Äôt know what I was missing! The Hi-def quality is so incredibly better for the same price!  It seemed better when making the switch last week and listening on the iPad Pro but today was the first time trying it on my sound system at home. The Onkyo receiver streams through our network with AirPlay.  With the audio quality set to Hi-Res Lossless 24-bit/192Hz It sounds awesome . They call it something like ‚ÄúDolby Atmos spatial audio‚Äù. Really sometimes it sounds like the music is coming from somewhere in between the speakers. I don‚Äôt know if this is the best place to share this but it‚Äôs about music so what the hey. Besides giving me a reason to find a better streaming music service, Joe also saved me about $60 because an Apple music subscription was 6 mo‚Äôs free though Best Buy!",1644376656.0

First, I do have a large library, and I have in the past changed file information one by one and it is so very tedious, and I've nearly doubled my library in the last 5 years.  So, I'd like to use a program to find and sort the album information.  However, I own a lot of video game music, through game rips, official albums, and steam soundtrack downloads, however, most of them don't show up in any of the info searches or separates them into smaller albums, even the ones that are the official releases, like ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D Official Soundtrack"", ""Ori and the Blind Forest Original Soundtrack CD"", or any of the Witcher soundtracks.  I've tried MediaMonkey, MusicBrainz, and Windows Media Player.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a program that can do that properly, or did I get unlucky enough to have a bunch of official compilation albums that were never uploaded?

Secondly, in more recent years, I've been getting albums that include multiple formats, mostly mp3 and flac, and those track sorting programs just bundle the mp3 and flac files into one folder.  Is there any program that can physically separate the flac, mp3, and wav files into separate folders AND rename them as such?",1644373259.0

snp7eg,"Moving ""Come Together"" would improve Abbey road",0,0.45,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/snp7eg/moving_come_together_would_improve_abbey_road/,8,"I think that moving ""Come Together"" to another place in the tracklist would improve the album quite alot.

The transition between come together and ""Something"" always bothers me a litlle, especially seeing how well the album tracklist flows otherwise.

It's like the album restarts due to the slow buildup and somewhat somber nature of something and has to start building again. If we put come together between lets say ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" and ""Sun King"" the album starts to make more sense imo.

Not only does it start in a better way, but come together vaguely expands upon you never give me your money and even ""Mean Mr. Mustard"" later down the line. It also pushes sun king back which makes sun kings connection with ""Here Comes The Sun"" more organic.

What do you guys think?

Edit: a better placement for come together might be at the end of Side A, as not to interupt the medley. My bad. 

Side B would stay intact",1644340081.0

In this video we're are going to dive into a fingerpicking classic and you'll learn how to play ""The Sound Of Silence"" as recorded by Simon & Garfunkel on guitar.

**Now Paul Simon was a master of combining cool fingerpicking patterns together with chord progressions**, and he has an amazing style all with just an acoustic guitar and vocals.

**Stealing just a few of these fingerpicking patterns and playing them through some chord progressions you may already know is a great way to start getting some in this style into your own playing.**

My background: I like going to house parties and really like house music. Not a commercial house, but good festival house. Wanted to be able to experience this myself at home, so I started making sets with the music that I really like. I have been doing this with great pleasure for 10 years now. The best part is that you can see someone enjoying your set :D

At parties I wear luminous shoes at the end of the evening (see photos). At festivals I often have a box with which I play my mix at the end, when all the music is turned off. Always nice, because then there is music ;) And nice that people can enjoy it too.

1.He's officially the best Artist of decade 2000‚Äôs

2.He does have 152 awards to his name including the one of the biggest to ‚Äòthe biggest‚Äô - Oscar!!

3.No one really hates him, He's one of the most (He's the most respected but don't want to respect someone's feelings) artist from the industry! Everyone appreciates his music from a kid to the grown ups everyone listens to his records!!

4.People emotionally connect themselves to his music, that guy doesn't even knows how many lives he has saved, how many people he has motivated, I am talking about the ones who thought to give up on things or give up this life either (You're reading it from one of them). You can't listen to any other artist probably when you're messed up and want to cry!!

5.He's the one guy who never shows off, you won't even hear controversies about him when he's not working, not even media tracks him because he's so simple that they don't get spicy stuff to report in news, OH yeah and that doesn't means he doesn't have popularity, The guy is on Billboards official list since decades, He never gets down! Maybe a few time but I never noticed! For example his 15 years old was on top 200 list last month!!

6.He's simple, not the one walking on red carpets with a suit who wants to blend in with the crowd and look attractive!! If he wants to wear a trouser and a jacket he'll do that, Well he'll do it and for the record he always wear trousers at any award show!!

7.He was nominated for Oscar, the guy won the damn Oscar but he didn't went to collect it, Why? Well his daughter had to watch cartoon at the exact same timing so ‚ÄòF*#k the Oscars‚Äô, Let's watch cartoon together!! He said ‚ÄòMy daughter is the most important thing to me and if she needs me whatever I am doing I'll drop it and be there with her and he has actually proved it multiple times!!

I am sorry for such long points, I can keep it going! If interested please ask in comments I'll add more!!

snf608,Why I think Kanye west is so great!,0,0.11,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/snf608/why_i_think_kanye_west_is_so_great/,3,"So I‚Äôll tell you why Kanye west is so great!

1.Every time he puts out an album he literally changes the face of hip-hop, and to an extent popular music as a whole.

2.The College Dropout, his first album, was one of the first to unify the underground and mainstream hip hop sound since the days of De La Soul, or Wu-Tang. It appealed to everyone, pop fans, hipsters, the ghetto, the middle class. At the time of its release, the music dominating the charts was the kind people think of when they talk about how they don't like rap...50 Cent, Eminem right at the time he was getting really bad, and the like. 

3.College Dropout helped change a lot of that and brought rappers like Lupe Fiasco and Common into the pop charts. It's poppy yet still personal, along the lines of a mid-period Beatles album. Stuff like that doesn't come around very often. Compare this and this and tell me they're the same thing. Late Registration started bringing in more orchestral sounds, making his music grander and more important-sounding. It's also really good, but as you're about to see, it's more of a transition album for him. 

4.Graduation is where we really start to see direct influence on today's music. ""Stronger,"" (you know, the Daft Punk sampling one) really kicked off the trend of mixing hip-hop and electronic which is all over the charts today. David Guetta, that Flo Rida song, all that stuff is directly from Graduation, and I'm of the opinion that a lot of EDM's mainstream popularity today is in part due to that album.

5.""Now hold up, cranestyles,"" you might say, ""all the stuff you're mentioning is crap. Kanye is indirectly responsible for David Guetta? Fuck that noise. Why is this good?""
Yes. All this stuff I'm mentioning is pretty crap, but Kanye does it really well and the amount of imitators something has often tends to be proportional to how good it is. A lot of shitty bands tried to copy the Beatles, a lot tried to copy Neutral Milk Hotel, and a lot of it was crap but it doesn't make the original any less genius. 

6.Kanye's first three albums are seriously solid pieces of hip hop, chronicling the rise of him as a rapper in a very personal way. I guess I neglected that, but seriously, Dropout is about being younger, poor, and struggling, Late Registration is the celebratory album, with darker hints creeping in at points like ""Diamonds From Sierra Leone,"" a song about the bling rappers sport so proudly coming from African oppression and genocide. Graduation gets even more soul-searching.

I am sorry for such long points, I can keep it going! If interested please ask in comments I'll add more!!

Have a nice day!!",1644308403.0

The song ""***The Legend of the Lion King***"" is a musical arrangement of the spiritual outlook of Taiwan's Kinmen culture by composer Su Wenqing. Since ancient times, Taiwan's outlying island, Kinmen, has changed its landscape from its original lushness to the disasters, deforestation, and battles of various eras. In addition to the threat of artillery shells, the wind-blown sand has always endangered the residents of Kinmen. Therefore, in order to ward off the sand and pray for peace, people began to worship the Wind Lion King, hoping to bring good luck. In the hearts of the Kinmen people, the Wind and Lion King is a spiritual symbol that stands firm. On the sandy island of Kinmen, he is constantly exposed to the wind, sun, and rain, yet he always stands there looking out over the land and guarding the residents. The composer's vivid musical vocabulary reveals the simple and natural style of the piece, and depicts the thoughts and emotions in the piece with vivid musical images. The piece is divided into three sections: ""Wind Blows Sand"", ""Wind and Lion King"", and ""Love in Wuzhou"". At the beginning, the melodious tune of ""Wind Blows Sand"" describes the beautiful island, with the wind whistling in a beautiful melody. The next section, ""The Wind and the Lion King,"" has an up-tempo rhythm that creates a musical image of the wind and clouds, just like seeing the Wind and Lion King standing guard over his home. The final piece, ""Love of Wuzhou"", expresses the feeling of longing for the Lion King and his homeland.",1644299121.0

sn7qbg,An unintended side effect of canceling my Spotify subscription: an incoming wave of nostalgia at the sight of my old iTunes library.,14,0.61,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sn7qbg/an_unintended_side_effect_of_canceling_my_spotify/,13,"So, I canceled my Spotify subscription last week. No points for guessing why. Since I use an iPhone, I figured I might as well switch to the Apple Music app that came pre-installed but which I'd never touched.

Imagine my joy when I open it up and see that my entire iTunes library, which has been tied to my Apple account for nearly twenty years now but had gone increasingly unused ever since I got a car with Bluetooth connectivity (so, around 2014), is right there. I barely even needed Apple Music's selection of playlists, not when I was too busy diving back into the vast collection of music that I'd assembled over the course of my middle school, high school, and college years.

'90s/early '00s alt-rockers from Pearl Jam to Alanis Morissette to Nirvana to Garbage to Michelle Branch to Oasis! Old-school hip-hop like N.W.A, Nas, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg, OutKast, and Tupac! So much pop-punk (blink-182, Sum 41, Paramore, MCR, The All-American Rejects, Avril Lavigne), metalcore/post-hardcore (Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, A Skylit Drive, A Day to Remember), and straight metal both modern (Disturbed, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Rob Zombie) and classic (Black Sabbath, Motley Crue, Pantera, Metallica)! Celtic punk like the Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly! (A side effect of growing up Irish on the East Coast. No regrets.) Classic rock like the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, AC/DC, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, and Pat Benatar! Early '10s pop singers like Lykke Li, Lana Del Rey, Rihanna, Lorde, CHVRCHES, Charli XCX, Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding, and I swear I must have been the only 'Merican in my graduating class who'd heard of Little Mix!

(And also my regrettable enjoyment of Trapt, Kid Rock, Lostprophets, and Blood on the Dance Floor at various points. *Brrrrrr.* I didn't need to remember *everything* about my youth, Apple.)

That's before getting into my TV and movie library. Granted, given how I'd never given up physical media for movies the way I had music, the impact wasn't as grand here, but it was still something.

Either way, just looking at my Apple Music library ported over from iTunes caused so much to come flooding back. The songs I listened to on the bus to school, on ski trips, in my room as I eagerly uploaded each new CD I purchased into my iMac, as I walked to my next class or back to my car in college. It felt like dusting off an old relic of my youth and finding that a lot of it still slaps. And I can still build on it, adding the artists I've discovered since alongside my old favorites. Hell, the fact that it's organized just like iTunes used to be, whereas Spotify's library, even if it does technically offer organization by artist and album, seems designed to funnel you into playlists designed for specific moods.

I think Todd in the Shadows hit upon something recently. Spotify's playlist structure has made ""vibes"" into the paradigm of pop music in the last five to ten years, with songs meant to flow together and serve as the soundtrack to your daily life. Songs for studying, songs for driving, songs for exercising, songs for the morning, songs for the evening. Apple Music and YouTube Music have playlists too, of course, and even before streaming, radio programmers knew what an ""at-work station"" and ""morning drive time"" were and what music was supposed to go there. But nobody does the soundtrack-ification of music quite like Spotify, who have made it central to how you listen to music on their platform -- and, because of Spotify's massive market share, central to how many people listen to music today.

There's another term for that sort of music meant to serve as a soundtrack to daily life. Muzak. A company devoted to just that sort of ""mood music"" for play in public places, their name became a byword for ""elevator music"", the crap that gets piped into elevators, malls, and waiting rooms in order to get you working and shopping, music designed to be non-intrusive and just *exist* as background noise. Spotify's main legacy, I feel, has been to make muzak as big as the British Invasion was in the '60s, or grunge was in the early '90s, as artists start writing songs around the playlists in order to land a spot on them.

Sorry to turn into my grouchy old parents, but my old iTunes library made me nostalgic not just for the specific songs and artists I loved in my youth, but also for the music landscape of the 2000s. Whether the songs in your library were uploaded from CDs, purchased for $0.99 a pop as singles, or acquired through... *other* avenues, there was still a sense of ownership and personal control over the music you listened to, whether you listened to it as individual songs, as albums, or in playlists of your own creation. That feels like it's gone away in a world where Spotify serves up algorithmically-generated playlists of songs for whatever mood you desire based on your listening habits. There's still tons of great music being made if you know where to look, but these playlists seem designed to make sure that you don't. I'm hoping that the current controversy knocks Spotify down a peg not just on general principle, but so it reduces their corrosive effect on popular music.",1644285295.0

I'm a big metalhead, but love all kinds music. As far as the podcast recommendations go, I'm kinda looking for more general stuff and not something super specific.

For example, I really love this one my wife turned me on to called Bandsplain. It's more of a long form podcast where the host and a guest (who's an expert, fan, or just knowledgeable about a band) will talk about a band's history (at length), go through their albums, and play full songs that give a good representation of what X band sounds like. This one seems to be generally rock related, but there are also some pop, rap, and country band episodes.

I just found one randomly called Dissect. This one seems more hip hop oriented, but still interesting. What I love about it is it has ""seasons"" where the host talks about one album and generally goes song by song for each episode. They seem to put a lot effort into it dropping in clips of the songs, clips from radio interviews, and going into history about the artist and then the album.

Per Wikipedia citing a Rolling Stone article: ""Buckingham stated that Azoff told him: ""Stevie never wants to be on a stage with you again."" According to Azoff, Nicks had taken issue with, on the evening of MusicCares, the guitarist's outburst just before the band's set over the intro music‚Äîthe studio recording of Nicks' ""Rhiannon""‚Äîand the way he ""smirked"" during Nicks' thank-you speech. Buckingham conceded that ""It wasn't about it being 'Rhiannon'. It just undermined the impact of our entrance. That's me being very specific about the right and wrong way to do something."" Days later, Buckingham called Azoff and asked, ""Is Stevie leaving the band, or am I getting kicked out?"" Azoff told him that he was ""getting ousted"" from the band after Nicks gave the other band members ""an ultimatum: Either \[Buckingham\] go\[es\] or she's going to go,"" to which they decided to fire him.""

Buckingham goes on to sue Fleetwood Mac for breach of contract, and they settle.

Buckingham was just as, if not more important than Nicks in elevating Fleetwood Mac to super stardom. Buckingham wrote the same number of tracks as Nicks on Rumours (4 writing credits each), Buckingham is their lead guitarist and vocalist whereas Nicks is only a vocalist, and Buckingham sang lead on more of the tracks on Rumours than Nicks. It's the same story on their preceding eponymous album. But then Buckingham and Nicks have a minor disagreement on tour, so Nicks lays down an ultimatum, and the band just rolls over and sides with Nicks?

It's even worse when you consider that Nicks likely would not have been famous or even in Fleetwood Mac without Buckingham: "" While investigating Sound City Recording Studio in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song ""Frozen Love"" from the *Buckingham Nicks* album. Impressed, he asked who the guitarist was. By chance, Buckingham and Nicks were also in Sound City recording demos, and Buckingham and Fleetwood were introduced. When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in December 1974, Fleetwood immediately contacted Buckingham and offered him the vacant guitar slot in his band. Buckingham told Fleetwood that he and Nicks were a team and that he didn't want to work without her. Fleetwood agreed to hire both of them, without an audition.""

Unless there's something more to it, that all just seems very ungrateful, and it's been bothering me when I think about it. Happy to hear other thoughts about this.",1644269994.0

Hey I'm XAKHI from India and i just released a new track ""Cologne"".

I'm trying to get connected to other musicians and music producers around India or outside

I'm really sorry if this post is annoying I apologize if you're not  interested but if you are, ""Cologne"" is an experimental song which I've  been working on for quite a while now I tap into lyrics and vocals  outside of my comfort zone

This is  the 2nd track from my upcoming ep: to the girls I've met which will be  released by mid 2022 There are a couple other experimental songs but i  wanted to put this out first as this was the hardest of them all

Again I'm sorry if you find this post annoying but I have to do what I can to get my music heard :( I'd really appreciate it if you spare 3 minutes of your time to give my song a listen

It's interesting to see the invention of all the components of the sound that would become codified as Heavy Metal with Black Sabbath's debut album. To visualise this development I picked 11 attributes of that early heavy metal sound, and then tried to find earlier examples of those attributes showing up in other genres. I'd be interested to hear any differing opinions on these elements, but the 11 components I picked are: 

&#x200B;

* Overdriven guitar
* Dual riffs
* Chugging
* Wailing vocals
* Lyrical darkness
* Technical bombast
* Tom-driven drum patterns
* Extended instrumental passages
* Satanic / Occult imagery
* Literary epic narratives

I've kept it to one song per artist to show the breadth of contributions, so with each band or artist I've tried to make a decision on which song of theirs is the most exemplary offering towards the genre.

But i didn't make so much of a progress in one year because i still have so many questions about it, even though its a easy task:

First: How you maintain the songs in your head? Because i mean, when i started i did a stupid stuff, just press play on the music and did something else that distracts me from the music, i did that for a week and i have ""listened"" 20 albums, and i can't remember a note from a bunch, so i changed tatica after listening to someone say to pay attention, and that leaves me to my next question.

Da fucking how? How to pay attention to music? It's to pay attention to the whole scope of the thing? Or individual elements? Because i tried that and i can't still remember a bunch of stuff of the album, and pretty often i get distracted, how?

And complementing the previous question, its normal to get distracted listening to an album and get lost on your mind and then realize that you are not paying attention and go back to pay attention only to that happen again a couple of minutes later? Because it's annoying and i can't remember the music after that

And what about that multiple listens thing? I really have to listen to the album more then 1 or 2 times to fully enjoy it or have an opinion about it? Theres no easy way about that? Because when i finish an album i want to have a opinion about it outright to make future listens more easy, and i want to go to other albums as quickly as possible because i don't want to keep relistening to these old albums, there is too much thing out there that i want to check it out 

Sorry if this text is stupid and all over the place, because everything about it is hella weird and new to me, i don't have a fully developed taste yet. 

Is it normal to want to listen to music but your mind keep you from listening? i mean, you really want to listen, a part of your brain want to hard to listen to an album, but the other dont and your mind keeps in a constant battle, is this normal? It happens with me in movies too, how i solve this? 

And knowing more about music can increase my experience? Where do i start to learn more about music? Like, i wanna know more about songwriting, production, perfomance and those stuff.

This is every question that i have about it, again if this sound stupid sorry, but its genuine, i really don't know, i have questions and questions and i just wanna enjoy new music, keep my mind fresh for new ideas.

Edit: Thanks everyone, you guys are saying some interesting shit, and pointed out that im overthinking, you all are right, thats just what i do for everything, but now that i have more clearence maybe i can to this without thinking so much",1644195268.0

A lot of this stems from the fact that many young artists with both talent in singing and song writing often sign themselves away to big music corporations to unknowingly get shove into a box and given a script to read. Now I could go on and on about how the music industry is flawed in many ways but that‚Äôs not what this is about. The originality is the easy part to explain every song you hear is about sex but inspiration is harder to define. Inspiration can hit you just like that or not at all but it is what gives life to music. A lot of people think that depth is what makes music what it is but without the inspiration to create it, it would just be an idea; easily forgotten. Without inspiration a creation seems hollow and without character which is the sense I get from most modern music today.",1644192538.0

Due to how often I listen to rap, it's hard to find rock music for me now since I'm so out of the loop. 

I've been through the emo phase, classic rock phase, hair metal,metal, grunge, numetal. 

 Incubus (morning view era), red hot chili peppers, puddle of Mudd, sublime, silverchair, 311, billy talent, 2000s foo fighters, bring me the horizon, etc. 

It seems like in the general rock category the major sounds of it is either 'arena dad rock' (Daughtry, five finger death punch), 'scientifically proven perfectly programmed pop rock like imagine dragons that is only manufactured to be the most annoying rock music around' and then indie rock like MGMT and Foster The People or Modest Mouse.



So I come here for help. Where is just the general...good rock, that isnt corny lyric big anthem dad rock'? That isn't quirky indie? That isnt soulless like imagine dragons? I really like the atmosphere and note carry of bands like incubus and RHCP, but I love interesting bands like rage against the machine as well.

Game of Pretend

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you first left me? 
Your baby girl crying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt leave‚Äù
You had people to enthrall as I wandered the empty halls

You were always so busy
Fueling your hungry greed
An obsessed man you were indeed

[Chorus] 
I remember when I couldn‚Äôt comprehend, the constant game of pretend
Not seeing the impending end 

Our surroundings falling apart 
For a new story to start 
To our artificial hearts 

Who knew I was such a fool 

[Verse 2] 
I stand and watch you
With head low and your mind in ruins
I play your favorite songs on my piano 
And let myself fall within your shadow

[Chorus] 
I remember when I couldn‚Äôt comprehend, the constant game of pretend
Not seeing the impending end 

Our surroundings falling apart 
For a new story to start our artificial hearts 

[Bridge] 
Can you tell me I was wrong? 
Give me the strength to move along
And find happiness I‚Äôve never felt
Make all the bad memories just a blur

See love in other‚Äôs eyes when they look at me
Escape my fears and break free 
The light at the end of the tunnel doesn‚Äôt seem hard to see

[Outro]
I remember when I couldn‚Äôt comprehend, the constant game of pretend",1644136666.0

Peter Gabriel. Groundbreaking and highly influential songwriter, vocalist, performer, film composer. Changed music video production forever in 1986 with Sledgehammer. Was integral to the drum sound of the 80s (during the recording of his 1980 solo album 'Melt', he gave Phil Collins instructions that led to the creation of the 'In The Air Tonight' massive gated drum production). 

Peter has done so much for music. His brief time with Genesis really pushed the boundaries of what rock music could be as an evolution of bands like The Beatles and The Who. 

His solo catalogue is eclectic and full of pop hits and experimental pursuits alike. But that catalogue really thinned out after 1992 and came to an abrupt halt after 2002 with his last studio album to date, 'Up'. And bare in mind, much of the contents of that 2002 album were written (and some recorded) in the 1990s. 

Boy has it dried up since then. No new original studio music, no tours, just not much of anything. Yeah I get it - he doesn't owe the world anything. But we could do much worse than a new PG studio album right now.

Where are you Peter? 

Ok your turn... Who are the artists that you love that fall into this category (and are still alive / capable of producing good new music) ??",1644135787.0

There was a white cat on the left holding a paintbrush with rainbow paint on it and a black cat on the right holding a paintbrush with the same thing as the other cat. they were holding their paintbrushes up against each other; like a cheer.

There's something about St. John's. Perhaps the architecture and its rich musical history, which Abbey Road studios stands testament to. It feels to me as if some of that magic still remains in this area. A ripple, a whisper of the golden age of music still stands. Alive and kicking. And in its warm embrace I feel shelter and congeniality. A rare and almost unmatched sympathique. We shake hands on the same page. 
The architecture also reflects some of that departed marvel. Many buildings stand mostly unchanged, still in the same style homes and buildings were in, back in that (musically speaking) beautiful era. Perhaps under this funky groove so alive in this area, I too can write a song of which I will be proud. 
St. John's, like a charming window into the past, a breathing remnant of the vivacious and vibrant musical age.
Beach Boys and Beatles contending on the charts. The Temptations, Thin Lizzy, Hendrix, The Doors, Crosby Stills Nash & Young. The Isley Brothers, Mamas and Papas, The Supremes, Bee-Gees, Yes. Sam Cooke, Otis, Stevie. Sly and the fam, Michael Jackson's beginning into the music scene with his siblings. The List is endless, and endlessly beautiful. 

How I wish we still produced music of that high quality, in such high quantities.
So much to choose from. Such variety. 
Yes, St. John's is a sparkling remnant of a bygone time. We do not produce music like that anymore. There is no niveau in much of today's music. It is saddening, angering, frustrating. The charts are but a major source of pain and disappointment.

Would the cracking of joints be classified as a percussion or wind instrument? 

I say wind because ultimately the sound-generating action is compressed air passing out of a vessel at a certain frequency, and she says percussion because it involves the friction or impact  of body parts.

I know very little about violin music but I‚Äôm an album collector.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can point me to some great solo violinists. I‚Äôm looking for tragic, sinking-Titanic sort of violin solos. Can be classical or modern. But no orchestra behind it ‚Äî just a violin. Looking for an entire vinyl album of this type of music.

*I  exchanged a few emails with deezer support, i've copied only the text  here, but if you wish i can provide proof (print screen pictures)...  here it goes:*

**Me:**  ""Hi! Im  a deezer hifi user. I logged on a friends macbook a few days  ago and  couldnt find the lossless button to engage flac listening. I  was sure  the lossless feature was in my hifi subscription since i was  enjoying it  at home. However i started sniffing around ""change my plan""  and i  pressed and engaged the premium plan. I dont understand the  difference  between the premium and hifi plan at all. And so i've tried  to revert  back to hifi plan BUT NOW I CANNOT. I've unsubscribed, and  each time i  tried to subscribe back, it automatically wanted to charge  me the  premium plan, not even giving me hifi option at all. Change plan  is now  giving me only ""family"" option on android phone, but not only  that, i  see no other plan to upgrade/downgrade. The only visible option  is  resubscription.But  honestly your plans are confusing as hell. When  i log out, and click on  plans, i doesnt even display the hifi option  between your plans...  Whats that all about?  
[https://www.deezer.com/en/offers](https://www.deezer.com/en/offers)¬†¬†¬†¬† Why is there no hifi offer?  
What i want: my Hifi plan for 8.99‚Ç¨ back, flac is the only reason i subbed.  
I guess the macbook was very old and the flac/lossless option was disabled. But i found that out today.""

**Deezer:** "" Hi there, I can see that your subscription is cancelled and will revert to free on 06-02-2022.¬†  
Once it turns to free, please visit [www.deezer.com/offers/hifi](http://www.deezer.com/offers/hifi)¬†to resubscribe.  
Please get back in touch if you need any further assistance.  
Kind regards, D\*\*\*\*""

**Me:** ""yes i unsubed, because it didnt give me an option to resub to hifi plan 8,99‚Ç¨. will do, what you are suggesting. tnx""

**Deezer:** "" Okay, have a nice day:) D\*\*\*\*""

**Me:**""can  you briefly explain to me the difference between the hifi and premium  plan? why is premium more¬†expensive? tnx, have¬†a nice day as well!""

**Deezer:**  ""Hi there, Premium  subscription now offers HiFi quality. Once your  account reverts to  free, you can resubscribe to premium and receive  FLAC quality. D\*\*\*\*""

**Me:** ""can you send me some comparisson chart or smthing?¬†its confusing to be honest..""

**Deezer:** "" Hi there, You can read up on Deezer premium on the following link:¬†[https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002436069-Deezer-Premium#:\~:text=With%20over%2073%2B%20million%20tracks,and%20soundtrack%20of%20your%20day](https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002436069-Deezer-Premium#:~:text=With%20over%2073%2B%20million%20tracks,and%20soundtrack%20of%20your%20day).  
Once   your account turns to free, you will not be able to subscribe to HiFi   as all of our subscriptions now comes with HiFi subscription. D\*\*\*\*""

**Me:** ""wait danny wtf???? you said in the previous mail:""Once it turns to free, please visit¬†[www.deezer.com/offers/hifi](http://www.deezer.com/offers/hifi)¬†to  resubscribe"" and now youre stating:""Once  your account turns to free,  you will not be able to subscribe to HiFi  as all of our subscriptions  now comes with HiFi subscription."" it makes no sense!!!!! i just want to  keep my hifi sub for 8.99‚Ç¨""

*Well,  at this point, i was pissed. Calm, but pissed and confused. I didnt  know if he was trolling me, since i wasn't sure which statement is true,  or he has no idea what Deezer is offering. And since he wasn't  responding, i pressed on...*

**Me:** "" im going on reddit and other social media with this...¬†are you okay¬†with that? sincerely, m""

**Deezer:**  ""  Hi, Sorry  for the confusion on my end. We have now put Hifi quality  in all of our  subscriptions, so you will not be able to subscribe to a  HiFi plan as  all of our plans now have HiFi quality. Once your account  turns to free you will be able to subscribe to any of our other plans  by visiting [www.deezer.com/offers](http://www.deezer.com/offers) Once again sorry for the confusion. D\*\*\*\*""

**Me:** "" but if i wouldnt accidentaly pressed on change subscription plan, id still be on hifi plan right?""

*After this, i got no reply yet. And my last question is really important. Because if he'd answer* ***yes***\*,  it would mean that he didnt do anything to help me revert my plan back  to Hifi, and that they are scummy company, grabbing every penny for a  mistake u made. If he'd answer\* ***no***\*,  it would mean, that they would need to notify the user in a change of  plan/ price change and i'd have to agree to that change of price. I got  no such email from them...\*

*Despite  doing absolutely nothing to help me, ignorring some of my questions and  making total confusion, but at the end at least saying sorry, i decided  to blur D\*\*\*\*.*

*I's up to you to decide, what's right and what's wrong. I'm just sharing my experience.*",1644087227.0
