My opinion has always been - if you _can_ work from home, you _should_.  There are obviously some lines of work that can't work remotely, and I understand that.  Even ""hybrid"" is fine if the commute isn't severe.   A forced full scale return?  No way.  It's been proven throughout the pandemic that remote work _works_.

Biden keeps talking about filling the downtowns and such again.  No.   That's not a reason to force return to the office.  With rising prices I'll not be going out to eat other than for very special occasions and/or ""treat yourself"" type things.   

It just makes me uncomfortable/rubs me the wrong way that he's pushing this.  (And again I would feel this regardless who was in office - R, D, I, etc....)

Since this post, I’ve gotten into contact with our parent company parent’s company about our dire personnel problem. After investigating the issue and seeing that I’ve been working all day every day since mid-late 2021 they found that the effort on my parent company’s part to find, hire, and train personnel was poor, at best, and told them their work practices were against their core values.

As a result they made them institute a few changes to “encourage” the solving of the problem. These really punish them/reward me financially for their reliance on one worker.

First, I am no longer capped at time-and-a-half for overtime. At 60 I get double, and at 70 I get triple.

Second, they created a max carry-over limit for vacation time and made it a requirement for it to be taken up until that limit. If it is not taken, the remaining balance is paid as quadruple overtime values and it automatically escalates to the larger parent company. I have over 100 days stored and I have to use 70 by August, the beginning of my “fiscal” year (my anniversary date).

Third, they said that there needs to be a dedicated HR manager overseeing my location and all US locations. This one isn’t in effect yet but I assume it will be soon.

Since the first post I’ve gotten two days off, which doesn’t sound like much but they were the best days I can remember. We’ve hired three people that I am training and preparing since I have to basically take 2 entire months of vacation. Obviously my pay has shot into the stratosphere, which is great too.

I wanted to say thank you to all the solutions and words of wisdom offered by so many of you. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and I’m pretty happy that the top of my food chain gets it.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the well-wishes, as well as all of you that have messaged me regarding unions - whether it was today or on my previous post. It’s something I’m seriously looking into.

Regarding my parent company’s parent company, they operate in and are based out of Europe. My company and my parent company are in North America. I’m sure you can connect the dots as to why the treatment of employees seems to differ drastically.

Again, thank you to everyone that reached out in an effort to help, offer words of wisdom, and show support. It means a lot and I appreciate the solidarity.",1646400884.0

t7cu32,I have a meeting with the owner of the company I work at on Monday because of my “performance issues”,,18,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t7cu32/i_have_a_meeting_with_the_owner_of_the_company_i/,20,"I’m really, really pissed. I started here as a general helper and was quickly moved into a foreman position due to the business rapidly expanding. I work in construction. My crew as a helper was 3 people, but once I became foreman I was limited to 2 people. The workload was not limited. My equipment, all of it, was on the verge of breaking to the point where I watched several hours of online mechanic videos on my off time to learn to service it myself to keep it running because it would break down every day at almost every job site and sending it to the shop would look bad on me for costing us money. What wasn’t broken was stolen from me on an almost weekly basis at our equipment yard (my socket set, my shovels, my brushes, my ice chest, my blower, my brooms, my pickaxes, my weed eaters, my hammers, my trash bags, my boots, quite literally everything that wasn’t nailed down) and *then* I was crucified for repurchasing all the things that were taken for me because I was “bloating up business expenses.”

They said I’m the most junior so I have to deal with it. Regardless, I was *still profitable.* I worked from 7:30am until 8pm M-F, sometimes saturdays to keep up, with my one helper to get our work done in between buying tools that were stolen and fixing our expensive machines on the job. I have been told to drive a CDL vehicle carrying hazmat material since we can’t afford a driver, I did that too. We finished out the season right on track with where we were supposed to be profit wise. I have recently been promoted into not just foreman, but project manager as well for my type of work. 

I only, *only* did all of this because they would hold money over my head. My base salary is 41k before taxes. Foremen and project managers get a commission structure where they get a percentage of profit generated for the week minus operational costs. HOWEVER, as I came to learn, I earned all of $1.79 in commission for 5 MONTHS of selling, scheduling, AND running my jobs due to me essentially shouldering the cost of every other crew who took all the things I’d buy every week. 

Anyways, recently my car broke down and my household went down to one vehicle. I got someone to handle picking up my son while my partner works and got a ride to work with my helper, everything is fine, except that for one day I’d have to leave early (3pm) to get my son. We had one job that day, and my international 4400 truck that carries our work rig catastrophically bit the dust. Wouldn’t run, wouldn’t jump, grinding metal and oil dripping from the engine, whatever. I personally towed it to the job site and did the job. I towed it back to the yard with a chain on a dump truck and then left. 

But because I left early, after clearing it with my boss and with the owner, I have gotten my ass chewed out so hard on the phone that I had to leave the family day with my partner and son at the park because I was so extremely mad and I didn’t want him to see me that way. I was called lazy, dishonest (someone claimed to see me at a bar at 4?) a waste of time, and overall disappointment for the business. They put my job on “final notice” and I was told they’d be contacting my friends and family (references) to “get to the bottom of where I was yesterday” and y’all I am so. Fucking. Mad. I’m having trouble thinking straight. I still finished my work, I did it cheaper because I had one less person, and I overcame catastrophic failure but I *dare* to leave early after getting my stuff done to get my son from school *one time?*

Anyways, I have a meeting with the owner and the person who accused me on Monday. I hate to say it, but I need this job. I cannot afford to quit or be fired and they know it. They’ve always held money over my head. Does anyone have ANY advice for me or my situation? I work in asphalt, concrete, and chip sealing. Basically road and driveway work. They said that to meet goals, I need to be twice as profitable as last year with no change in crew or equipment. Last year we cleared about 30k a month in profit. I’m almost thinking of saying they need me and my skill set far more than I need them and their treatment of me, but I have never ever put my foot down here and I’d like to know what you guys think.

Edit: Just for some additional info, I’ve had to purchase several expensive things that have been stolen and/or unreimbursed as well. Most expensive being my tool sets and brand new iPhone to use for our job app. I know the common answer is to bring the tools home, but there’s so much and so many that I simply can’t transport them all. I took the things that would fit in my vehicle, but I live in an apartment with no garage so I can’t bring much more than that home with me.",1646497070.0

For a company that considers itself progressive, why are you against workers that want to unionize? What better way to SHOW how much you appreciate your employees, and show the world how progressive you are, than by SUPPORTING these workers who only want fair treatment and pay (especially when profits are up and the CEO gets a raise!). I will not, and will encourage friends and family not to purchase anything from Starbucks until workers are free to unionize and are not penalized for doing so.",1646512530.0

My job, a count agent at a local indian casino is fulfilling but tiring.   
I am the youngest in my department and have a good 2 months of training under my belt and am very good at what I do.  
However despite the good pay and decent coworkers I was lied to by management on multiple occasions and HR before hiring me.   
They told me I'd work a maximum of 7-8 hours a day part time, its double that most of the time. This of course doesn't work with my schedule so I've scheduled it to take up my weekends, and due to this lie I've grown to resent my job, to the point where I skip, A LOT. And the crazy thing? They don't care, they won't fire me and CANT fire me. They're short staffed when I skip and have to cancel the drop unless they can push a manager on the job so I know they're bleeding employment.   
So moral of the story, employers are struggling right now and will lie to employ you. But don't think they can punish you for anything because firing you means they have to lie to and train another sucker.",1646490555.0

Wanted a job closer to home so I applied for a position at TELLE tire and auto in Richmond heights, Missouri.    Hiring process was a bit disorganized and long.   Waiting.  Called all my references all excellent.  Waiting. Waiting. Finally after a month they sent me a offer.    

I accepted.  Money was good.  Closer to home.  They were thrilled I accepted the position.  
All good right?

I leave notice at my current job.  They hire a replacement for me.    I am about to start new job and I emailed in to ask where do I park when I come to work. 

They email me back that I need to park on a side street a few blocks away that isn’t visible to the shop.   

So I emailed the owner who I have been dealing with and asked if there was any alternatives to parking on the street when it’s not even visible from the shop.   I have a newer truck and catalytic converter thefts are a epidemic in that area.  

So what does he do?   He emails me back that he rescinded his offer and good luck.  

I tried to call him and the coward wouldn’t even get on the phone.   So now since my position was already filled am left with no job and have to quickly look for something else that will work. 

What a way to screw over someone for asking something about a legitimate concern!!!  

I’ve served my country. Served my community for years as a volunteer Paramedic.   Have kids at home, one that has special needs, to support and give my shirt off my back to help people and first time ever I ever been put in a spot like this. 

Was I wrong for asking?   What are your thoughts?

I’d love to demolish their reviews grrrrr.   It’s sad that more and more employers could care less about their employees.

Thanks for your time and thoughts.  Please hope that I can find a good job and fit soon.    In the meantime wish all of you a great day!",1646420786.0

**Employee owned equity companies.**


The best type of companies I have ever found in my entire life are employee-owned agencies. No stockholders to greedily throw money at the company and then take all of the pay away from everyone else. No insanely overpaid managers that get to steal from the lower level employees. All profit is shared in a fair and equitable way. Say profit is 3 million for the year. Lowest level employees get the biggest bonus, then managers, then owners. So managers and owners will still make quite a bit of money, just not as much as they would elsewhere, and the lower level employees get a living wage that they can actually survive off of and be happy about.",1646510272.0

Not only have I been exponentially more productive at home, my quality of life has improved drastically. My mental health is better because I’m not sitting for hours rage-induced in stop-and-go traffic. I have time to eat and eat healthily; my body is looking better. I have time to workout or nap during the day. Time to run an errand or two that I don’t have to cut into my weekend for. *I will never work from full-time from an office for the rest of my life. And I’m letting my boss know that.* The C-level is absolutely brain dead. We are **bleeding** quality workers because of non-competitive pay, and the single most important benefit the survey they sent out shows is WFH. If they cancel that, they can kiss any semblance of quality work goodbye.

You’re not the only one that wants to work from home, I guarantee you. We need to collectively let it be known that these sorts of policies will not be tolerated.

And when it was announced we were going back, all he said was “You’re not allowed to refuse to come in and i would appreciate you not making a fuss about it because you know it’s not fair for us to get special privileges when other groups can’t work from home.”

Now I understand that if management says we need to come back to the office there’s not much he could have done but it would have been nice if he hadn’t spent over a year telling us how much he cared when now he’s getting excited about going back and trying to psych us up to be in the same room. And of course he says he wants to hear our concerns but if we do he will just note that we’re not being a team player and we’re complaining instead of “serving” the needs of other employees and the customers like we’re supposed to in the company mission statement.

Nah I’m not excited to go back to the office and work for a company that doesn’t give two shots about my health and safety and if I died of covid would being replacing me within a week.

It was my first leadership position and my director of surgical services seemed like she was going to be a great mentor to me. So color me surprised when shortly after starting, she announced that her last day was in three weeks. Well shit... The hospital had another director lined up, but she wouldn't be starting for another 6 weeks. So here I was, a new manager with no experience and only minimal training trying to keep a ship afloat in choppy waters while doing both my job and my director's. Administration (CNO, CFO, etc.) Promised up and down that I would have all the support I needed, but it was literally the 3rd day after the director left before I had the CFO chewing me out for over staffing. fast forward to the end of my 2nd week by myself and I've reached my limit. Staff morale, which was already low before I started was at a breaking point because they weren't getting their hours, I was on the CFO's shit list, and the CNO had barely said 10 words to me(So much for all that support I was supposed to receive). I wasn't sleeping well due to the stress and knew that I could not mentally or physically make it another month. My first goal was to do the whole ""print out everybody's wages and leave them in the printer"" revenge. But lo and behold only a director can access them. So on to plan B. Another reason for low morale amongst the staff was an unofficial policy of not approving time off until a few weeks before the requested time off. So the Monday of my third week I quietly went around to staff letting them know I would be looking at time off requests that Wednesday. Fast forward to Wednesday and I request a one on one meeting with the CNO. Surprise surprise she doesn't have time in her schedule to meet me. ""Just 5 minutes!"" I say. ""Okay fine, I think I can fit you in around 11"" At 10:55 every single member of my staff has every last time off request approved. Didn't matter if someone else had requested that date off earlier, if you wanted it, you got it. I then turned in my resignation to a surprised CNO, and grinned ear to ear as I walked out of that hospital for the last time knowing I had done what little I could to support my staff.

But, with some of my posts, it’s apparent that I don’t enjoy where I work, in the slightest, and this was the straw that made me realize that they don’t give a fuck.

So last year, around September (I think it was September; Goldfish brain is goldfish brain) Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana. My city was one of the worst affected by it, unfortunately. The hospital I work at was out of power for almost a month and a half. During this time period, for around the first month, I was also out of power, as were most people in Southern LA. 

Now, for those of you who don’t know, LA was declared in a “state of emergency”, meaning that it was a disaster zone. We ended up getting FEMA, and all of these other resources during this time. But, I’m getting off topic. 

My place of work, for the first two weeks, was pretty understanding. We were given full two-weeks pay, not taking away from our PTO. This was great, and immensely helped our situation. Fast forward about a week later now. My Chef sends a group text to all the cooks, that was basically along the lines of:

“Administration (CEO, and others) have decided that while we cannot let anyone back to work yet, we also cannot pay you for this time. In order for you to be payed, it will come out of your accrued PTO balance.”

This absolutely infuriated me, because being there for just over a year, I didn’t have but maybe a week and a half’s worth of PTO. So, I ended up getting fucked, just because I wasn’t permitted to work in a state-declared disaster. 

This sort of shit shouldn’t have happened to begin with, because for one, we weren’t allowed to work regardless (and didn’t return to work until about mid October), but also, *it was a state-declared emergency*. Absolutely minimal support from my job during this time, and it drove me mad.",1646428308.0

I put in a time off request for two days to travel to a funeral. Manager calls the day of the funeral (before the service, thankfully) just to ""check in"". This occurred on a Thursday, so I suspect he was checking or trying to gauge if I was going to need Friday off as well, though he didn't say it or offer. I gabbed like I was fine and that I'd be back in the next day (even though I was most definitely not fine, but I've had bad experiences tipping my hand to bosses).

I've been in the US Air Force for 11 years.  I am a Crew Chief (general mechanic) and anyone who has ever been 2A knows that no matter your airframe or job, it seems like the system is designed to TRY and give you reasons to quit after one or two enlistments.  I swore that sometimes I only stayed in because SOMEDAY I would get the chance to be the Section Chief that people remembered as having the workers' well being and interests on the radar at all time.  I *firmly* believe that people will work hard for you acknowledge their work and you give them every incentive in your power to distribute.  

Now make no mistake, I understand the importance of keeping a mission-ready fleet, especially since my aircraft have been directly involved in hundreds of humanitarian missions over the last decade.  I made E6 in 2021 and moved to a supervisory role coordinating 60+ people during week-long in-hangar inspections.  This has been my chance to really exercise my authority over the day-to-day lives of young men and women.  I make sure they take lunches, I make sure they get leave approved, I make sure they get home on time.  I will NOT make them start a 3-hour job 45 minutes before shift change.  I will NOT make them work through lunch.  If they DO go above and beyond, I make sure to reward them on the back end, or at thebvery least pull them aside and tell them that it isn't unnoticed.

Here's the issue: 

I've been consistently reprimanded and scolded for ""spoiling"" the Airmen.  I got a slap on the wrist because I sent a young guy home because a famiky emergency back home had kept him up late a few days in a row and he was falling asleep with tools in his hands.  I got counseled for making sure work stops 30 minutes before shift-change so that tools can be accounted for and documentation can be accomplished DURING the shift, not on their off-time.  

It's been 6 months of this, and I feel like I've been beaten down.  I've already earned a reputation as the Dock Chief the Airmen love working for, but that the Section Chiefs (above me) are frustrated by.  I am proud of myself for this, but I'm also aware it can't last forever without the pressure crushing me. 

These 18-to-23-year-olds are *people*, and as much as the Air Force HAS to be a well-oiled machine, you can't do that unless you give people a reason to want to come to work, to feel appreciated, and to feel like they accomplished something as a team.

NOW don't get me wrong. Our store isn't huge. We pull maybe $1,000 a day in sales on average.

The other lives pretty far from work and he says about 80% of his paycheck goes into his gas tank, and gas just jumped almost a dollar this week alone. What is that kid gonna do now?

And those are just the two examples off of the dome. But anyway, I've mentioned it to my manager and she tells me ""Well we're a small company and this isn't a job you do for the money.""

t6llro,Regarding the Middle Management Hate,,64,0.83,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t6llro/regarding_the_middle_management_hate/,29,"Spent most of my career in corporate middle management so far and thought I would weigh in a bit. 

Some of your managers are absolutely going to suck and make life worse for you. I think many of you realize that. With that said, what some may not be aware of however is how much our hands are tied when we WANT to help you as well. At my last job I was literally told 'this habit of supporting your team instead of leadership is not working. You ARE leadership, please align with us'. This was mostly in response to me pushing back against insane timelines that were driving consistent 60-70 hour or longer weeks and supporting my team in working from home. 

As much as some managers legitimately want to help you, their own managers will often stand in the way of it. A lot of people don't have the financial security to stand their ground on issues like this and it becomes a pay the mortgage vs. do the right thing decision for them. I'm under NDA regarding what happened next in my own situation but I can say that I was happy with the outcome and no longer work there. 

Please keep in mind that many managers, especially as you get into more senior roles, have been extensively coached on their fiduciary responsibility to the company. Some of them have drank the Kool-Aid and legitimately believe the moral thing is to support the company bottom line, others are just dicks, and a few of us are out there trying to help you but it is **absolutely** an uphill battle. If you're lucky enough to have a manager who supports you **stand in solidarity with them**. Unions are great but, barring that since it's a pretty long road to establish one,  even small alliances where senior leadership knows that messing with one member of the team would cause them all to quit goes a LONG way in curtailing the worst of their behaviors.",1646408129.0

t6nxaq,The story of John: the homeless man who lives on my street works more hours than most people I know.,,30,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t6nxaq/the_story_of_john_the_homeless_man_who_lives_on/,2,"I really feel like the collapse is coming soon. It’s crazy how many people think or say shit like “homeless people are just lazy drug addicts!” Well let me tell you a story about John (name changed for his privacy.) 

When I first met John, I didn’t know he was homeless. I went into the tobacco shop, when I first moved here, to go get some blunt wraps. John works there. He’s gruff and grumpy, he looks kinda like a rough around the edges type. I didn’t think much of it other than “ah he’s probably just some crotchety old guy who doesn’t have much to say. I usually love to chat it up with people but he wasn’t really having it. 

Well fast forward over the next few months, I go in almost every other day and John is always working. Maybe twice in the last six months it wasn’t him at the counter but instead the owner of the store. I inquired about John and the owner said he was “out sick.” I started catching on pretty quick that this dude usually works every day from open until close. 9am-9pm most days. 

There’s nothing really across the street so I didn’t go over there much, but one night my girlfriend and I decided to go for a walk, low and behold, the homeless man sleeping in the doorway of the abandoned shop across from the center with the tobacco shop, is John. What the hell! I couldn’t believe it. This dude works probably close to 80-90 hours A WEEK and lives on the street. I was truly heartbroken. 

My partner and I don’t have much means, but last Christmas we had a crap ton of food left over because a bunch of my friends and family dropped off food as I was going through recovery from a surgery at the time. We decided we could never finish the leftovers ourselves so we made up two big ass plates and heated them up and wrapped them in foil, a bag of pan dulce and cookies, and some hot chocolate with a little rum. We figured they deserve as much as anyone for a little extra warmth. Well we brought it over to them, along with a joint, so maybe they would sleep a little better or help their body pain some. (We asked them if they drank/smoke and we brought the hot chocolate without the booze mixed in.) It was pouring when we brought them the food, John’s girlfriend, we’ll call her Mary, started crying and thanking us profusely. 

We told them we genuinely didn’t want to embarrass them or anything but we had a ton of leftovers and could never finish it and wanted them to have a nice Christmas dinner too! We talked to them for a bit and turned out John and Mary both have full time jobs. John also had a triple bypass less than 4 months before that Christmas! Mary also struggled with various health problems. 

I couldn’t believe it, I cried the whole walk home and for an hour after we got inside. We didn’t know what else to do to help, but sometimes when we have extra stuff we stop over and ask if they need anything. 

This story is not to get any praise but to just show that this capitalism shit is really failing. These people don’t deserve this.. they succumbed to the same temptations that capitalism praises us for! Markets to us.. why should we allow people to suffer like this and demonize them?? 

Truly just such a sad sight to behold.. working 90 hours of your week to sleep on the street.. what the fuck. We nee this system to move in to something better, and fast.",1646414318.0

He's lying about using a new financial institution. Payroll hasn't changed. He just didn't send the wire for it. Why? Nobody knows. The company has made over a million dollars last year. He knew this would happen Wednesday when he didn't send the wire and chose not to tell anybody until the night before.

t684j9,Busting some myths on taxation comparing USA vs. a Nordic country (Finland),,205,0.97,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t684j9/busting_some_myths_on_taxation_comparing_usa_vs_a/,51,"Hello,


please bear with me as this is my 2nd ever Reddit post hence formatting will propably be a shitshow.

I just noticed [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t5ql19/over_60000_before_deductions_and_less_than_40000/) on this subreddit and decided to compare their wages to mine as it seemed similar and I am under the impression many Americans believe the Nordics tax people very heavily.


From the post we can see that they earned $617.07 in a workweek, working 37 hours after which the takeaway was $385.24, bringing total taxes and deductions to a whopping 37,6%! Net earned is hence 62,4% and net per day is $77.406, gross per day is $123.414.

I'll use the ""official"" calculation method of 21.5 workdays a month, that we use here in Finland in pretty much everywhere.

My salary in Finland in my job year is 2476.54€ per month. I will earn my monthly salary times 12.5 this year, since we get a holiday pay each year, totalling 30 965.75€. I am working 8 hour days with an hour non-paid lunch each day. Two 10 minute coffee breaks. Job is very relaxed, no stress over it.


Every worker in Finland earns holiday days and holiday pay if they are working enough, rules for accruing holiday days and hence holiday pay are [here](https://www.tyosuojelu.fi/web/en/employment-relationship/annual-holidays/number-of-holiday-days).

My total net/takehome each month with a similar salary as per the post I linked will on average 1928€ assuming I do not work overtime, which should not happen in my work. With the 21.5 workdays rule each month that means average net daily of just a few euro cents under 90 euros. Compare that to the just the 77 dollars of the post I linked.
In addition to the salary abowe, I will be getting half a month's of salary before my yearly summer holiday, as per the law and I will take a 4 week paid holiday in the summer.

I used our governmental tax administration's [official tax percentage calculator](https://www.vero.fi/en/individuals/tax-cards-and-tax-returns/tax_card/tax-percentage-calculator/) to do the math.
I did not input any deductions that would make me pay less taxes, these might be using your own car to drive long distances to work etc. These can actually give you tax breaks in Finland!

So while the American (I assume American) paid taxes and deductions on a similar salary for 37.6%, I pay them for 22.15%. This 22.15% includes actual taxes for 13.5%, national unemployment insurance for 1.5% and national pension insurance contribituon for 7.15% all of which I benefit from.

I do not have to pay for healthcare except for a measly twenty something euros if I need to go to the doctor, all yearly health payments are capped at 800 euros a year.

I also wanted to include some graphs.

Median salaries in the [USA](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html) and [Finland](https://stat.fi/tup/kokeelliset-tilastot/tulorekisterin_palkat_ja_palkkiot/2021-joulukuu/index.html) (notice the spikes in the summer holidays, that is the holiday pay people are getting just as they head to summer holidays in july and august)
Also here is a chart depicting [tax brackets in Finland](https://www.veronmaksajat.fi/luvut/Laskelmat/Palkansaajan-veroprosentit/). Though taxation rises heavily the more you earn, as you can see in in the marginal tax rate (the tax you pay from the money earned above what you make now) low income earners pay very little tax in Finland and we pay pretty much nothing ""extra"" beyond taxes. Some consumer goods are more expensive like gasoline for example which is around the 2€/l mark now, but housing is quite affordable compared to North America for example, especially out of the Helsinki metropolitan area.

Tl;dr: In short, you are getting royally fucked, I am paying less in taxes and deductions and taking more home than this poor American fella and getting much more out of them in nearly free healthcare, education etc.

There is a program here called the California Conservation Corps (CCC) that houses and works young adults in California for ""environmental conservation purposes.""

Part of the program is what they call ""Emergencies"", where the people in the ""program"" can ordered to be transported far distances to camps supporting personal fighting wildfires with as little as 2 hours to prepare.. where they are worked **FOR 2-3 WEEKS STRAIGHT, 14 HOURS A DAY MINIMUM**. You do not know how long you will be there, and they withhold the information from the workers. You will be fired if you ask to work fewer hours. You will be fired if you ask to not roll on an ""Emergency"". These ""Emergencies"" are planned ahead of time, and aren't simply responding to a natural disaster.

**They sleep in small tents, often times in animal pens with literal shit everywhere.** There are no guidelines around labor laws that are followed. *Temperatures are often extremely hot, air condition is extremely poor, and the work is labor intensive(and outside).*

Several people experience extreme burnout and emotional distress going as far as **injuring themselves.** Most of the people in the CCC are neuro-diverse, struggling and looking for help, which the CCC advertises itself as being accepting and helping, mind you. 

I saw somebody suffering from a breakdown literally smash their metal canteen into their head repeatedly from stress, they were fired weeks later.
 
After the 2-3 weeks are up, crews get 2-3 days of ""rest"" (Which may include working a normal project, such as removing invasive plants) before being sent back out to another camp.

Oh and **overtime pay isn't time and a half. It's $16 hour flat** because crews are paid on a stipend. (And they're told we can't unionize because it's a ""program"", constantly)

I have been working from home for about a month and half due to my dad's cancer coming back. This time the cancer is more aggressive and the doctors have told us to prepare for the worst. I am a (26M), I have been helping my mom with anything she needs. My mom can't work at the moment because she's taking care of my dad 100% of the time. I also have a (13M) little brother who needs to be taken and picked up from school as well as after school activities. Since we have nobody else  to help, I have been taking him everywhere. I am also on the phone constantly with the hospital and handling all legal preparations for when the worst happens.  You could say my plate is already very full.

Yesterday, upper management let me know that I need to come back into the office full time starting next week. The company makes us work from 8am to 5pm M-F and they are based in a suburb that is 40 miles away from my parents and I. With traffic the round trip can be anywhere from 3 to 4 hours, so I wouldn't be able to pick up my brother any more from school, take him to afterschool activities, or be there in case of an emergency. 

I have let management know that this doesn't work for me and that I am very thankful and appreciative of them being so accommodating for the past month and half. I can't be so far away when my family needs me.  I have also let them know that I have been able to do all my duties and have shown that I can work hard from home. None of this was enough.  Managements excuse are the following:

""Everyone is going through something, that's life"" - I feel like this is very cold, specially since I have been a loyal and hardworking employee for 3.5 years. 

""Part of the job description is to work from the office"" -True by why not adapt and continue to help me out for a little bit longer? I am a Construction Project Manager, so all my work can be done from a laptop and cellphone. So why do I need to be in a cubicle that's 40 miles away from my dying father?

I don't understand where this is coming from. I was extremely shocked at how close minded and cold he was during our conversation. 

I want to know what my options are here. They can't really afford to fire me since the company is very small and have had multiple people leave in the past year. I am currently involved in 30% of the projects so losing me could be costly. I'm not quitting because I would like to qualify for unemployment benefits.

One of us attends a school where they are required to wear all black all the time and if there is a small symbol on it they are required to turn there shirt inside out. They learn and perform services for clients which the school charges the clients for and they should definitely be presentable but also are all adults and pay the school plenty of tuition. I think the the issue is that administrators would not be so nit-picky or feel they had the right to subvert another persons autonomy unless they were women. 
          The other works at the largest health care administration in the country and the guidelines state they should make the environment/dress code“homelike” some people still choose and are allowed to wear all manner of scrubs, leggings with sweaters, leggings with sweatshirts, jeans with sweaters or sweatshirts and/or matching colored scrub outfits. However if we wear a nice athletic outfit that is matching, (addidas, champion, fila.) with very minimal symbols. We are told we cant wear sweats. Our idea of sweats is old baggy grey sweatpants u would wear to the gym not the form fitting, identical to scrubs in almost every way outfits we would like to wear. Unfortunately i also feel like there is a cultural component to this, if we wear scrubs we are good but athletic uniforms are something not worn by the dominate majority so are not ok. 
           We also kinda feel like our bodies our choice. Finally, one of the positions requires we perform athletic physical moves in life threatening situations in which a tight, binding pant/belt/shirt might get u seriously injured or killed. I apologize for the length but feel this is an important work reform.How would you handle this, any suggestions?

TL;DR

It was already moral to seize the assets of billionaires who are literally murdering people wholesale, of course, and now there is a legal precedent set as well. 

This sets up an interesting framework for the future of anti-capitalist/democratic market socialist/just plain common sense politics and action on climate change:

* If it's moral and legal to seize the wealth of billionaires who are financing slaughter in Ukraine, then it's legal and moral to seize the wealth of, say, oil companies who are killing millions of people due to the existing and soon to arrive effects of climate change, and use that money to de-carbonize the planet.

* Since neoliberalism is the prevailing ideology of the Western countries responsible for this particular rapid and enormous re-distribution of wealth, then the only path to this sort of whole scale change is to run local candidates for the popular liberal and neoliberal political parties all across the world on a platform of expanding these now both moral and legal actions to all large scale impending disasters that threaten the survival of the human race, like nuclear war and climate change.

The job I quit had dangled a dollar raise in front of me for around three months after a year of employment. As soon as I found a better job (pays 2 dollars more an hour, benefits, pto, adult job), I let my boss know id have to pass a drug test in a month and let her know I’d finish my shifts. After one day, I realized I wasn’t gonna be able to stay abstinent from cannabis (the job I quit was in that industry), and said I wouldn’t be returning for the rest of my shifts. Last Saturday was the first shift I had been responsible for that I didn’t show up for.

Today, havin a nice drive with the windows down, she pulls up and unloads on me about how unreliable I was and what a piece of shit I was and how she always knew I never cared.


I was flabbergasted. This was the first I had heard from any of my coworkers since I quit. As soon as I got home, I called the HR person that I’ve been in regular contact with at my new job and let her know that there was animosity that I wasn’t aware of, and to please remove them from my professional references because I had been publicly shamed by one of the keyholders.

The lady I interviewed with (On Zoom) spent the entire 10 minutes telling me about the job, the company and what they do. I literally only had to answer two questions: ""Do you think you can do the job?"" I answered yes, and ""Can you start right away?"" I answered yes again because I can. I also addressed the fact that I have an upcoming trip out of town for my daughter's school activity in April.

At the end, the interviewer (and owner of the company, I found out later) told me ""Great. I guess now we're just waiting on your background check to come in and I'll be in touch with you soon!""

Today, I get a phone call from the recruiter who set up the interview. The company ""can't make a decision and wants a second interview.""

Seriously? In my 20+ years of looking for work, once they've told you they're ""just waiting on the background check"" (which I KNOW is clear) it has ALWAYS meant you got the job. I guess even THAT has changed now and it SUCKS.

What worries me more is the fact that the recruiter who called this morning was asking me ""follow up"" questions like ""Are you the type who comes in early and stays late or do you prefer to leave when your scheduled time is over?"" I was honest and told her that while I'm not opposed to spending an extra half hour or so here and there,  I really prefer to leave work at work and unless absolutely necessary, I'm not going to spend hours at the office over my schedule.

What sounded like a job that might be right up my alley is now sounding more like a nightmare designed in corporate hell.

Maybe this is a blessing in disguise? If it is, I'm really getting tired of those things.  


\*\*UPDATE\*\*  
My second round interview is scheduled for tomorrow at 10am. 

I also have an interview set up for a slightly-higher-than-entry-level position with a state agency on Tuesday, NOT through the recruiter and at a lower income. It is, however, a position within an agency I have a high amount of respect for and frequently go out of my way to support. It could turn out to be a good fit for me and I CAN survive on the considerable pay difference. 

I may completely remove my hat from this if it looks like a 2-night stay, 3-ring circus where I'm just another trained seal.

I'll update tomorrow if I get anything worth reporting.

Granted we all get the useful and unforgettably awesome experiences, but it was mostly stressful and degrading. The common issue with shop owners, and the folks of higher positions is their unreasonable and downright unrealistic expectations for their employees. All while paying them as little as possible. While never improving wages, shop conditions, or growing employees from within the company. It's not hard to see why most places go through employees more than they clean the toilets. But I digest...

If you wish to enter the Automotive industry, especially commission based jobs. Be aware of the disgusting and cruel industry that hasn't changed it's values much in damn near a century. Be ready to work for shop owners that will take advantage of you, and your customers without flinching. Dealership owners that have vacation properties worth tens of millions, while their employees live in the parking lots at night.

Do your homework about EVs, and if you have electrical experience you might have some hope in progressing within EV diagnostic and repair. Although I would highly advise alternative routes to becoming a ""technician"" or ""mechanic"". Seek higher pay and value your time. Never allow shop owners to take advantage of your hard work ethic, because they do it everyday. All while breeding a toxic work environment, and rewarding those who prove to be most toxic.

This industry has to improve greatly because it employs some of the sharpest minds and hard  working people who are passionate about their customers. It's not just the automotive industry, I know. This is a common issue not just in my field but everywhere. Sadly I do not have the answer or solution. But rather some food for thought. Please know it's not just your field/industry.

I'm not lazy, I'm just tired.

I refused and is now incredibly hostile. Is it legal for them to ask a co-worker/underling to join this sort of scheme? 

I’ve been working at this job for about a month. First two and a half weeks were a breeze, I really enjoy the work; it’s right up my alley. I was paired with this supervisor who was an absolute peach for the first two days; super helpful, kind and responsive to my questions. On the third day they asked me if I would like to become a part of their mentorship program (a separate business that they run while not working at this job) to which I did not accept. The next day their demeanor and attitude had taken a complete 180. They no longer wanted me to ask them questions. Any query was instantly brushed away with the response that this was all covered in prior training. Every mistake, real, or perceived, was met with instant criticism and incredible impatience. Coupled with the very obvious preferential treatment that they showed toward other co workers really had me questioning what I had done wrong for many days. Their attitude kept getting worse by the day until eventually they started getting confrontational. I honestly had had enough at that point as well and was almost going to take action in the form of a formal complaint to HR or the manager. Before I could however, our schedules switched and I ended up paired with another supervisor who I enjoyed working with and learning from. I asked my manager to pair me with them for the remainder of the training period and they allowed it. This week my former supervisor walked into my office where I was training with my current supervisor, they sat down and proceeded to have a 40 minute conversation with them about getting them and their family to join this “business”. Current supervisor even responded that this sounded like a pyramid scheme multiple times, to which former supervisor amazingly dished out the same schpiel they did with me. My question; is this legal? And should I do something about it or should I just let it go? I respect the hustle however, the dramatic change in my supervisor’s attitude created a toxic work environment, necessitating me to take action or outright quit my job is a fact that just doesn’t sit right with me.

I had a part-time contract extended after my studies to complete the project. We executed well, and I was approached by the head of operations, head of HR and the MD, encouraging me to apply to this very specialized role in the company as they saw me as a good fit.   


After a very short interview process my manager-to-be got back to me, praising my efforts and that all of upper management was very impressed by my accomplishments. She offered me the equivalent 66k USD for the position. This was less than I made at my previous job.   


I countered with the equivalent of 132.500. Partially because the limited data I could gather about such as positions suggested it (despite me having 0 experience), and also partly as a giant ""fuck you"" to the company for lowballing me. I expected no more to come from this.   
After a few back and forths, we settled at 96k.

I propose the minute wage where you get paid for every 60seconds, this will give everyone a fairer wage as well the rounding up and down and maths isn't too hard to do. 

Say the hourly wage is £9.50 an hour and you work for 8hours and 34mins, the current system would likely round down to 8hrs 30mins of pay meaning you get £80.75.

If the wage was paid minutely for the same rate of £9.50 an hour you would receive 15.8p per min which is 16p after rounding so after 8hrs 34mins you would receive:

8hrs 34mins in mins = (8x60) + 34
= 514

514 x 16 = 8224 = £82.24 

That is a while £1.5 more.

My job is a little complicated. I was working for a company at an entry level employee. 

I picked up a lot of slack (we were very understaffed as we opened during the pandemic) and covered a lot of shifts because I was doing online classes for college that allowed a lot of flexibility. 
Eventually i became “shift lead” - i was in charge of a couple orders from vendors and some inventory for the store. 

I noticed, however, that my pay never increased when i became shift lead. i just had more responsibilities. 

The old manager left his position to work full time for his personal business that’s tied to the store that i work for - the owner of the store i work for approached me and asked me to fill in the management role until september  of this year (started January of this year). 

I got ZERO training. And i am currently putting my college degree on hold in order to do this job. Granted, i negotiated a salary for this role, but my goodness….the work i am doing is WAY more than they told me i would be doing. 

I am paid for 40hrs a week, my paycheck is the same each week. But some weeks i’m at the store for 60hrs, or 50hrs, etc. 

I manage 21 employees, the schedule, vendors, inventory, ordering, order deliveries, spreadsheets, etc. It’s too much for me to handle, on top of working at the storefront for 40+hrs. 

For context, i am 22 years old, running somebody else’s business as they didn’t have another candidate for this management role. I am putting my college on hold for this and I have no personal life anymore, i am on call 24/7 as i’m the only one around to fix any problems or cover any shifts. 

I’ve already spoken to the owner about how much i am struggling with this job and how i need help ASAP.

Some back story: I've been working for a company for four years now as self employed. They are a very small company (only two people) and if they hire me I would become their first employee. Earlier in the year I asked for a pay increase (I get paid per item I make and it hasn't increased since I started working there) and they said they can't afford a pay rise, so are offering me employment instead.

We are now negotiating pay and work expectations etc and today we had a conversation that unsettled me a bit. I had written out a list of questions which they'd answered and I'm trying to work out if I'm unreasonable, or if I'm being put in a position where they might take advantage of me. These are the things that I had issues with:

I asked for 1k more than their yearly offer and they said no.
I asked if there would be an hourly overtime for any extra time I put in during busy periods, and they said that they'd expect a certain amount of time unpaid to show that I'm loyal to the company/commited to helping them succeed.
I asked if my wage would increase yearly with inflation and they said no, but that we might be able to review it every couple of years when they put their pricing up.

I understand not wanting to negotiate the wage, and I'm happy to do some work for free, but the no inflation adjustment bit just unsettles me. I'm aware that it means every year I work for them I'll basically be earning less, and I feel like it should be a basic requirement?

Would I be out of line to insist on it, and tell them it's a deal breaker? Or is this the kind of thing that I can review after a year working for them? Sorry if this all confusing to read, I'm happy to explain more in the comments.",1646338838.0

But like, that’s not how that works right? Just think about it for a minute. Do you think if any company could raise profits just by raising prices, they wouldn’t have done that already? If I’m selling X product for 4$, but could make more money for 5$, I’d sell it for 5$. If I’d lose too many sales to make more profit selling it for 6$, I won’t. 

How does raising any business expenses change this at all? It’s still not going to be any more profitable to raise the price. Raising prices isn’t just some magical way to increase revenue every time cost goes up. The only wait to actually increase revenue, is to perfectly balance price and demand. Your business cost has absolutely nothing to do with either of those factors.

Got on the phone with her and tried to explain that as a human adult living in America, I don't work for free and news money to afford basic necessities.

I found a place that respects their employees. They are committed to a healthy office environment with practices that are actually fair and transparent. The benefits are really wild. We get a 9% 403b employer contribution regardless of what we contribute. We get 15 days pto, 12 days sick, 2 days personal, and 25 holidays immediately upon hire. 6 weeks paid parental leave and lots of other cushy bennies. 

The office is 50% hybrid wfh, which means everyone works three days from home on week one and two days from home on week two. Since they (we) just started working in the office again after two years 100% wfh, they are giving everyone a $70 bonus for six paychecks. 

Here's the most amazing part: my job duties are specific and they end. I asked my boss what I do when I finish all of the work for the day and he seemed confused. He doesn't have a never ending list of busy duties. It's all so efficient. The procedures are simple and all make sense. 

My pay is 25% higher than my last position with actual room for growth. 

I got this job after being fired from my second to last position. I really thought my life was over when I got fired. Then after getting hired somewhere that sucked, I was job hunting again after only 8 months. I was again convinced I'd never find a well-paying job so quickly.

It took me three months of very active hunting. Three weeks of interviewing with 10 orgs. This is the only org that made an offer. I'm glad to share everything I know about job hunting and if you PM me I'll share the open positions with the org I'm currently at. Just keep your spirits up.

I don't have any problem with this, except that most of the time, 1/2 of my teammembers aren't very familiar with things, and so they end up escalating to me when they get an issue and they are the person on call, so I'm effectively on call twice. The expectation is that I answer calls all the time, even when I'm not on call. 

We work for a global company, and have several teams in the EU. We have to frequently interact with these teams, and the ongoing joke is that asking them anything after hours is pointless because they don't answer calls/texts/emails until the next day. I understand that this is due to EU labor laws, and I personally agree with those laws. 

Today while my boss was talking about on-call, I vented that its unfair that our company is able to function as a worldwide company and that the teams out of EU have figured out a way to function without having to answer after-hours calls, but the teams in the US don't get that luxury. My intent was for him to understand the disparity and possibly discuss it with his peers and try to help design a system that is more equitable for all employees. If the company is able to operate profitiably in the EU, why can't they do the same in the US?

Instead of understanding my comment, he took it as me venting that our EU peers *should* have to answer their calls after hours. He vented how they are so upset about the new security monitoring tools that are being installed on their laptops and how they are so spoiled. He vented that in the 80s he would get threated with fines if he even emailed his coworkers in Germany. After he vented a bit, I asked whether our company could look at creating a more equal policy regarding after hours contact. I think it clicked on what I was getting at, and he talked a lot about the EU employees don't get paid as well, or that they pay higher taxes, and that they aren't afforded the same luxuries that we are in the US. We finished that call and I started looking for transfer opportunities to work for one of the EU based teams. 

Reflecting, its just funny to me that he thinks it's better to have low job enjoyment, but be able to have a ""bigger house"" or ""nicer things""

A number of years ago, I worked at a fairly well known payroll company. We did a few HR things as well but mostly it was running payroll and year end forms for employers to provide for their employees. Like any other business, we did have a few customers who just did not want to or were not able to pay their bills.

One day, I'm answering the phones for someone who's on a break. I don't remember the conversation verbatim, but he was calling in and wondering who he had to speak to to get his W2.

So thinking this was a customer of ours, I asked him for his account number. Of course, he doesn't have one. Alright then, what is the business name? Find it, look for the authorized contacts on the account. Is this X or Y?

Then it comes out. He is not an authorized contact on the account he is an employee of the company, and the owner told him if he wants his W2, he needs to call us and pay for us to print and send it to him.

I told him that wouldn't happen for several reasons: 1) You are not an authorized signer on the account so I cannot release any information to you, even if it involves your own paycheck, and 2) Your employer is our customer and is responsible for the bill.

I then gave him the IRS number to call if his employer still refuses to present him with his W2. I don't think he was very happy, and I don't know what the outcome was, but I just hope he followed my advice and didn't do something else foolish to get the information like let his employer deduct the money from his pay.

Note: Because I could not release any information about the account to this person, I did not tell him that the account was actually several thousand dollars past due. The employer was not paying for the W2 service because he would have to bring his account current before that could happen.",1646240687.0

Fast forward to January, I get my raise, but the paychecks are coming out to the same amount. I see that they are deducting hours.

t59mms,Detrimental employee benefit,,5,0.78,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t59mms/detrimental_employee_benefit/,5,"My partner just got a notification from her employer that they got a new employee benefit : dental insurance. Side note : Insurance companies contracts generally state that joining is mandatory, most likely because they don't want to end up only with the heavy/costly beneficiaries.

Employer pays 40% of the cost, 60% (50$) is deducted from every employees' pay (every 2 weeks). Employees also need to pay a 20% cover charge for every dental procedure they incur. The insurance doesn't cover whitening, orthodontics, or other non-mandatory procedures. Which means dental cleaning (capped at twice a year), root canal and broken teeth are all you're getting.

&#x200B;

Let's do some math :

* cleaning is 150$ where I'm from
* With the insurance, you pay 1300$ (26 weeks \* 50$) + 60$ (20% of 1 visit/year \* 2 adults), add an extra 60$ if you decide to go twice a year since you're now insured
* Without the insurance, you pay 300$ (1 visit/year \* 2 adults), 600$ if twice a year
* The new benefits makes you 1000$ poorer a year. On a 50k salary, that's like a 2% pay cut, when inflation is through the roof.

Unless you're incurring 2000$ dental cost per year, you're losing out on this deal. There is also a 1500$ yearly cap, so if you got into an accident and need a full dental reconstruction and REALLY would have benefited from an insurance, you're still screwed.

Am I missing something? How can an employer put such benefits in place? Status quo would have literally been better!",1646253614.0

I [19f] was a server at IHOP. A few days ago, one of our newer servers accidentally rang in a kids jr cheeseburger while trying to ring in a different kids meal. As the food was coming up, she caught her mistake & told the cooks, went back to fix her ticket, etc. They pushed the kid's meal off to the side & everyone continued on about their day.

About an hour later, I still see the kid's meal sitting in what we call 'the window'. I asked my fellow servers & the cooks if it was “dead” (meaning: cold, throw away, can’t serve) They told me yes, so instead of throwing it away, I put it in a to-go box & put it in the fridge that we have in the server station. My plan was to bring it home to my daughter [4f]. We’ve been struggling lately & this would likely be the only meal that I could feed her for the day.

I wrap up for the day, grab my kiddo's burger & catch the bus home. I greet my daughter, say bye to my sitter & warm up the jr cheeseburger. I bring it to my daughter & she’s ecstatic, obviously. I leave her to her burger & barbies & go to the living room to relax when my phone rings.

It’s my general manager. To make a long story shorter, she said that she saw on camera where I stole a meal & “hid” it in the fridge. I explained to her that not only was the food dead but, my daughter & I have been struggling extremely badly lately. She told me that’s unfortunate but, nevertheless, it’s corporate policy that what I did qualifies as stealing & is automatic termination. Tried to resonate with her to no avail, obviously.

I get that I was wrong but, I really wish they didn’t fire me for it. Just puts me in a shittier predicament. Whatever. I did take food that wasn’t mine. But, it was going in the trash anyway? I don’t get it but, clearly, I fucked up there. Yesterday, corporate finally called me back as I did call to try & fight it, I was basically told the same thing. That while my situation is unfortunate, i still breached policy.

Companies want to cry and complain about poaching? How about you pay your workers more and treat them better instead of treating them like disposable pieces of trash. It's funny how a company can discard you because they want to but don't you dare quit and go work for our competitors. 

For those about free market capitalism, you should be the most fired up about this because the non compete restrictions prevents you from having freedom.

Make it illegal to prevent a worker from quitting their job and going to work for someone who competes with the company they quit from.

t570yy,Advice from a hiring manager,,4,0.61,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t570yy/advice_from_a_hiring_manager/,3,"I work in the IT field and have to hire people occasionally. Here are some things I shared with the last candidate I hired when they mentioned the offer from HR was a little low:

1. I chose you. That means you're the thing I value.
2. If you are being hired to a position in a larger company, the manager hiring most likely isn't trying to pay you out of their own pocket. You getting more money is not taking money from them in most cases.
3. As a manager, it makes it much easier for me to give you more responsibility if you are getting paid more from day one. If I'm an asshole I'll pile on the responsibility anyway, but you won't last long that way.
4. Don't undervalue yourself when you assess what you'll accept for an offer. There are many jobs and fewer applicants. See point number 1.
5. If you propose a counter-offer, provide your reasons why you believe it a fair response. I don't know why everyone doesn't counter-offer if you're low balled. If it's a job you're interested in then provide a counter offer. If they just toss your application in the bin when you do then you wouldn't want to work for them anyway and you should post their name to this sub as a warning to everyone else. The worst thing they can do about your counter offer is say no and then you're back to where you were. If you're being hired by someone that is irritated by this then they are a fucking prick and not a boss you want. 

I told the last person I hired this, because the worker always comes first for me. They countered and got a bump in position and huge salary increase from the initial offer. Win win because of point 3. My experience is extremely limited in the job market in general, so I have no idea about other industries.",1646246642.0

I ran night audit for a hotel. My sleep schedule, even outside my job, revolved around this fact. Scheduling anything was impossible as things were usually booked early in the morning or I was waking up early, hoping I didn't oversleep and miss them. Some days, I couldn't sleep at all, and pulling a 36-42 hour day became not uncommon.

I worked this position for four years. I only saw wage raises when I confronted my boss for them, and was told the company had ""limited budget"". I ran the audit. I saw how much the hotel made each day. They were lying.

I have seasonal affective disorder. It's gotten worse and worse over the years, but this last winter I nearly tried to kill myself three times. Mostly due to stressful days at work accompanied by lonliness. I have a long distance partner and they stopped working nights, so while they would stay up and talk to me, I was spending 4-5 hours alone every night. Crying in the car on the way home became commonplace.

I started taking medication. It didn't help. My medical bills started cutting into my savings. I take an anti-anxiety pill for sleep, and two antidepressants. They give me frequent migraines. I would go into work with them.

I was in charge of over 250 people every day. The only employee at the hotel every night. Anyone had a problem, it was my fault. I was screamed at because I wasn't maintenance, or because the car lot was full in winter, or our rates weren't cheap enough. I've had to call the police because of drunks refusing to leave the bar 3 hours after it closed, getting their drunken entertainment by harassing and catcalling me. Homeless people begged me to let them stay and not kick them out when it was -10°F outside. The fire alarm has gone off due to stoners thinking a bag over the detector works, and due to faulty detectors. I was the only one there to deal with it. I only met the head manager twice, and one of those was when I was being interviewed.

I was paid $15/hour. I started at $13 and had to beg my way higher.

I was required to show up at meetings scheduled in the middle of the day, between two shifts. When I tried to say that it would mean I get no sleep, I was told ""it doesn't matter; they're required for everyone."" My coworkers worked 7-day weeks with 1-day breaks after. Someone once had so many shifts in a 36-hour period that they were not given more than 5 hours off. I don't even know if that's legal.

Some days, the morning shift wouldn't come in. We only had two or three people scheduled for it at any given day. If none of them answered their phone, I was told to stay and wait until managers showed up. Managers wouldn't wake up until the shift was almost over, and lived hours away. Pulling a double shift, only to come in the same night, wasn't uncommon.

I did this for four years. It's broken me as a person.

I was paid minimum wage. I wanted to find a new job and a place to live with my SO but after spending two months not getting a single interview for any accounting position, I tried to kill myself three days ago. I failed, and my SO demanded I quit. I don't know how long my savings will last me, or if I will find a new position and be able to move away from this chapter in my life, but I did so anyways. I couldn't keep going anymore, and I am never going to let myself be abused like that again.",1646137974.0

I don't want to give away too much at the moment as I have not left yet. I live and work in the UK.

New manager was promoted in January from a team leader position to a supervisor in the company (big international corporation) and they started off by setting unreachable and unrealistic targets for my team of four people who looks after the legal requirements of the business for an area. We had some meetings and expressed our doubt in being able to reach said targets and why we were given them in the first place as they do not actually help us do our job or have anything to do with productivity.

A week passed, this manager decides to hand out written warnings to everyone (three out of four) who did not meet the targets - this was two days in a row. Three is a disciplinary. All of us talk to them and advise the targets are not realistic, I also (as the senior) escalate this to our upper management and HR as a concern. In this time, we also have a department removed in the business and half their job passed onto us for no additional pay. Everyone brings up concerns, communication goes down the toilet between teams.

In the time I was waiting to see what happens I got another job offer, less responsibility, more money. I put my notice in. I ask for a meeting with upper management and HR to tell them why I am leaving. They beg me to stay. I say sure, pay me 30% more and I will consider it. They can't do that. Well, unlucky I guess? 

My colleague takes a week off for stress, in this time realises, this job's shit, put his notice in yesterdat as well. I just laughed and told him well done when he told me. The new manager loses half his staff in his first two months and I know for a fact the third is actively looking for another job.",1646174642.0

So I (19f) work with horses with just a few other people working there, so when someone is sick or has a day off it's kind of hectic. Now two weeks ago my brother got COVID and I also had to stay home so I missed a day of work and not my stepdad had COVID and there is a big chance that I also have it.

Now I always show up for work, I work overtime when I have to and don't even get that paid. I don't complain a lot at work and do everything my boss asks of me.

Now since my stepdad has COVID I have to stay home for 5 days because that are the rules in my country on the fifth day I have to get tested and such.

Now I let my boss now right away that I couldn't come into work due to this. But this morning he called me and said that it was really hectic at work and wether I had COVID or not I have to come in the next work day. 

If I have COVID I need to stay home for another 5 days. I'm getting tested today and will probably know the result this evening, but If I do have COVID I'm obviously not allowed to go to work and I'm not a person that likes confrontation. My parents say that I should just say that I'm not allowed to go and should stand my ground but I'm not very good at it and I'm not looking for to getting the results and a possible confrontation.",1646245939.0
t4rycp,Former employer keeps reaching out to hire me back. They are more desperate than I am valuable.,,34,0.96,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t4rycp/former_employer_keeps_reaching_out_to_hire_me/,14,"TLDR;  Work will not reform by itself.  There are better jobs out there with employers worthy of your effort.  My former company is suffering the consequences of its actions.

Know your worth.  Discuss compensation with peers.  Provide great value.  Be your own best advocate.  Support worthy employers.  My story:

I left this employer in mid 2020 and they have reached out to me six times to hire me back.   I left at the start of a growing resignation trend that is still accelerating.  I have contributed to that trend by helping friends find jobs.  The vacant positions are dumping workloads on those that remain, accelerating burnout.

They're reaping what they have sown.  I lasted eight years despite their average employee leaving before two years.  I called out their creative compensation analyses that justified a >10% compensation target reduction despite years of positive reviews.  I watched their employment policies evolve to their advantage, moving employee reviews behind closed doors and robbing employees of citable positive reviews.  I witnessed them screwing over unwitting/undeserving employees to make them quit and conform to stack ranking mandates.  Their loyalty only goes as far as my usefulness to them.  

Most people don't notice or care about this stuff until it happens to them.  I got burned out, started calling it in for a while to recover, and found a great new job.  I'm making 10% more at my current company and they just offered another 15% on top of that to return.  

They're only doing this because they are desperate.  **The manager that offered +15% yesterday is the same person that, four years ago, gave me that contrived >10% compensation target reduction.**  I find fault with the company, not this manager.

I'm not going back.  Being burned out again would be completely my fault.",1646196267.0

I honestly don't know where to begin or how to even feel at this point. I am a 28 year disabled veteran. I was hurt in the military where I destroyed both my feet and recieved a horrible head injury. My feet injury causes me to have to sit once in a while and my head causes sleep issues for me now so I'm required to work during the day. 

Well I was hired by Amazon in their Reliability and Maintenance Engineering department. Mainly fixing motors, conveyor systems, and robots. I was hired for day shift do to my head injury this was stated during the hiring process several times, as well as being documented and disclosed through the disclosure papers provided during the hiring process. Did all my trainings, and then was pulled off to the side by a manager telling me I'm actually on nights now from 7pm to 530am, I explain my situation to which I'm told ""I either do it or I'm fired"" well I Cant get fired and not get paid so I bite my tongue and went about my schedule shift, was doing it for a couple months till I had a medical emergency where I ended up in the ER (02/13/2022)for a heart arrhythmia do to sleep deprivation. After I'm checked out and release I update my manager about what happened and that I need to have my disabilities accommodated.  (02/15/2022)I explained my whole situation to him on how I submitted all my proper paper work for accommodations. Come to learn that the person I handed in all my paper work to quit and never submitted my documents so I told I need to resubmit everything. So I start to get all the documents and such around and makin Dr appointments to get everything up to date for them to. 

I'm then told on 02/16/2022 that my shift wont be from 7p to 530a anymore but 9p to 730a starting on our next shifts. So I was pretty upset since I Already had trouble with sleep deprivation. I go to my supervisor/manager and tell them about how my accommodations are in the process of being submitted and I will soon need to go on another shift. He tells me he will speak to HR about it and get back to me. I didn't hear anything back from him or HR about a shift change so to not get in trouble I went to the 9p to 730a shift from 02/23/2022 to 02/27/2022. With out complaints or anything I did what was required of me even though it was putting my health at risk. I said one more thing to my manager about my accommodations for shifts. He tells me he would let me know. Then on 02/28/2022 at 10pm I get a call telling me to not return to work and that I'm being let go do to safety concerns. I ask what safety concern so I can improve on it. They tell me they Cant discuss it. So now I'm at this point where I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I definitely feel like its directly related to me needing accommodations for my disabilities. 

Is there anything legally I can do? Is there anyone I can reach out to about this? Like I'm supposed to give a 2 week notice when I leave a job,  but I get a random phone call at night just telling me I Cant come back to work. I'm just so lost right now, I really loved that job.

In general, I like my job. I work for a nonprofit. My salary could be better for the number of hats I wear and sometimes I get stuck with going to outreach events and other things on the weekends, but the hours are flexible enough that I can make things work that I might not be able to swing in other jobs and my health and dental insurance are fully paid which is rather nice.

Anyway, because of occasionally having to work wonky hours, I get a *lot* of accrued PTO. I use it sparingly to save for a rainy day, but yesterday I just couldn’t get out of bed and go into the office. Outside of that job, I’m a freelance sports photographer, and on both Saturday and Sunday I put in 15+ hour days starting at 5am because the events I had lined up were a couple hours from my house, and was completely physically exhausted from basically hiking most of the day while carrying 30 pounds of gear on my back. I texted my boss that I needed to cash in a day to just chill and recharge, to which he said “No problem, see you tomorrow”.

When my dad got home, he wanted to know why I was there since he’s almost always home before me, and I explained. My explanation was met with a telling-off and lecture about how I can’t just be taking time off whenever I want for whatever reason I want, and how I “can’t let being tired get in the way of my real job”.

My dad is almost 60 and has been at this one job for about 30 years so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised that he has this kind of view towards work, but I’m just frustrated and need to vent. The reason I have all of this PTO in the first place is because I work extra hours all the time and am an exempt employee so I don’t get OT. I sacrifice Saturdays all the time in order to do my job but apparently I’m not supposed to reclaim that time at my discretion, instead only when it’s for a “legitimate” reason?

Aside from the straight up ghosting, employers are taking 3+ weeks from my initial application to reach out to set up an interview.

And all of this is after I've done all their BS assessments for free, tailored my resume for the company, and in some cases wrote a cover letter.

I run Amazon accounts for a living. I'm fairly good at it. My first time running an account was courtesy of a company taking a chance on me. But I dug into the position and very quickly realized I was good at it. In relatively short time, what was an account earning almost nothing hit half a million in a year. Almost $2 million the year after that. Three years in, and we're hitting half a mil every month. 

In doing this job, I created the artwork for listings (taught myself Illustrator), I wrote product copy, optimized everything for search, ran ads, and did a dozen different things completely unrelated to the job description. I actually built custom applications for data analysis and task automation for my job. Even ran customer service when the manager was out. 

And then I realized it. My boss was selling to small businesses, that were in turn selling on Amazon. See, any work I did benefited anyone selling our product along side us. If I improved a listing, it made more money for *everyone*. I knew these stores carried our product, but what I didn't realize was he collecting commission on them. Had been the whole time. 

Also, the new guy they hired was bored out of his mind with no work to do, but turned out he was getting paid more than me. The web developer, graphic artist, accountant, and even sales reps were too. I became privy to sales figures for other areas of the company, and found I was pulling in 30% of the entire company's revenue. By myself. I generated more revenue than the entire sales team. 

To put it into perspective, if I had quit my job from the beginning, bought the product at wholesale value, and sold it on Amazon myself, I'd be making $65k a month after 3 years. One store my boss sold to was making about $20k a month in profit from our products. 

We had COVID make its way into the office around this time. I quit shortly after when I was asked to take on more work and ""we can discuss a possible pay raise in the future if it goes well.""

I'd already accepted a fast food job that I'm using purely to save. Fast food job pays $12/hr.

I'd asked before what they would be paying and they tried to tell me to wait for the interview. I called back today and told them I never any to a job without knowing the pay (which is true).

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.""

I thought I'd finally be able to live on my own, so I rent a house and moved in. I live in Brazil, so I'll explain this in our local currency, but for the record, R$1 is worth about USD 0,19.

They were paying me about R$1500 a month for 9 hours a day, 6 days a week.  This averages R$ 6,66 BEFORE taxes, so that means I was working my ass off for USD 1,29 an hour before taxes. Kind of hard to believe, but this is way above the minimum wage over here.

The house I rent was in very poor condition, in a very poor and violent area, and it cost me about R$750 per month. Other expenses such as groceries, electricity, water and internet bills were about another R$710 per month. I didn't have the money to pay all that because taxes, so I had the help of my parents. I was living mostly off noodles and eggs. It's also important to note that I am very conservative about electricity and water, so I kept all uses to the bare minimum. I've not even mentioned the meds I have to take, because I have depression and autism. They're expensive af and there's no way to get them for free.

The work conditions were shit. It was at the mall and we didn't have a restroom in the store. So we had to walk all the way to the mall's restroom whenever we needed to pee. That's not a problem per se, but the manager often gave us an earful when we needed to pee.

I often had to work overtime, with no extra payment. This was at least 4 times a week.

My only day off during the week was always in the middle of the week, in a Tuesday or Wednesday.

I barely had any time to breathe, as we were always understaffed, with 4 or 5 employees to keep a giant ass store running. Sometimes 3.

The customers were mostly very rude Karens. I had to listen to insults all day, because of course the fault was on me if the line was gigantic and we didn't have any change. Not because we were severely understaffed or because they gave us almost no change money to work with.

I had to fullfill all roles, clean the store, wash dishes, take care of the inventory, be a cashier, serve customers, and a hell of a lot more.

The last straw was when I had food intoxication. My manager forced me to work when I was so sick that I couldn't stand still without throwing up or shitting my pants. The other day I went to the hospital, and they said I couldn't work until I got better. My boss said it was hard to work with me because I was unreliable, then he threatened to fire me. So I said fuck it, and quit that job for good.

Because of this job I sank deeper into my depression, and had frequent panic attacks. It also gave me PTSD because of how poorly I was treated and how hard they made me work.

TLDR: I had a job where I was mentally abused and overworked, barely had money to eat, and it aggravated my mental disorders, while also acquiring some new ones.

It's starting to stress me out,,7,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t48sk1/im_leaving_my_job_soon_its_starting_to_stress_me/,0,"I'm leaving my job soon, hopefully within the next month at the longest. I started this position like 2 years ago as a lending originator for a big bank after working on a desk for a couple years. I was great at my job, like best in my market great, had my market manager fight to get me this job great, didn't need to interview with my current bosses boss like other people great at it... I came from another company alot of my Co workers had left to come here, they all failed and I succeeded giving about 80%... And I liked my job, because my manager let me do as I pleased as long as the numbers were up, she was happy and I wasn't being asked by her to do anything I didn't think was wrong. My dad tried to help me growing up with saving and such, but us being lower middle class growing up he didn't like credit and didn't really teach me about it.... I was happy to help kids and even parents learn about things it took me a long time to grasp so they could be better off than me at my age.

So when my boss was moving, and they were upping the amount of cold calls they wanted us doing (they call them warm because they're already customers, but really they're cold calls and I'm just not comfortable with doing them) I took this job because it was supposed to be more freedom, and better pay... First year for most of it I helped with ppp loans, then got told ""well your part is done, go do your job you never learned properly now"" and I did, and got OK at it... I could be better, I could probably be the best in my region.... If I cared.... But I don't... Not about making someone else money anymore anyway. I still stick my neck out for clients, and make sure they're taken care of... But I'm not going out of my way to pad the numbers anymore. They gave us a new title about a year in, it was supposed to make things better for us, it's just been a way for them to take compensation away in our bonus plan when they realize too many people are getting it... They took away a $2000/ quarter bonus most people got easily... Replaced with nothing... That's an 8k pay cut for most people... We were told ""well if you just have more files you'll make it back up""

I'm also in a location that treats me like garbage, I ended up having to take a leave of absence because of it and they won't move me out of this location. 

The kicker was the other day, I'm doing a loan for someone I know and closing has been rescheduled 5 times now, underwriting has been rude to me and unhelpful to him. I told my manager about this on a one on one call we had last week... His response was that I should have more loans in so if one falls through I don't need to worry so much about it.... I don't care about the money, I won't see a bonus anyway because I don't have many files between it being slow and me just getting back the beginning of the year... And even if I did it wasn't the point... I was concerned about this client, I would have been even if it was Joe shmo off the street... He's had a shit experience, he's upset and his loan should have closed... It wasn't going to be denied, it was our fault for rushing the closing and not getting things out in time... They complain about surveys but then this is their response to an upset client?

I knew I was planning to leave, but that just killed any drive I had left, I'm barely going through the motions anymore and I can't in good conscience work for this place any longer.

The good and bad thing is that I'm training for a new job, career really, starting this weekend... But I will probably have to do a couple months of unpaid (if I'm lucky) ride alongs. It's to be a home inspector, and there aren't alot of multi inspector firms, it's really an own your own business kind of thing... I was under the impression when I signed up that there were places that hire (and there are, just not as many in my state because you have to ride along on 125 inspections)

The worst of it is I'm actually really interested in this, so far I've enjoyed the material I've gone through and am really looking forward to getting into the field and seeing homes and such... And also helping people make an informed decision on the biggest investment they'll probably ever make. Not to mention the idea of probably working less if I own my own business and making more money for me and my family instead of someone else is great...

I don't know, I saw someone else's post about what people do if they arent working and I'm just getting stressed, I don't really want to go back to working evenings selling cell phones or something to get by and get stuck doing it long term again (previous job i mentioned) because I'm just so over sales.... And I'm actually excited to be doing something that I'm paid for based on my own merits, not how well I can push someone into something they don't need, or just how lucky I get I got a good call. Not to mention something that's done for the day when I go home... I dunno maybe I just needed to rant a bit",1646143915.0

hello r/WorkReform , I was hoping I could get some advice on what to do about my work situation. writing this on a throwaway due to privacy reasons.

I work at a small fast food place in Canada for minimum wage. I am an adult and work to support my home and my pets. I have a S/O that is currently on unemployment, so we have money coming in, but it's now becoming extremely tight due to my scheduling ""issue"" at work.

I started this job late last year, asking for 30-35 hours a week which I got with no issues until this January. since January, I've only been scheduled for 1-3 shifts a week, and when I'm ready to leave to go to work, my job will call or text me that my shift is canceled due to weather, it being slow, etc. often, since I'm already ready, I'll walk up to my job to get a coffee anyways and scope out the scene. it's rarely slow when they claim it is. I thought that for a few weeks I was only getting a small amount of shifts due to it being after Christmas, as for fast food and retail it tends to slow down around that time, so I decided to wait. but it is genuinely getting worse. 

I've barely worked in weeks. no other coworker of mine, even students, are working as little hours as I am. more than once I have missed out on tips (we split them evenly) that I was working for due to my tip cup being put away or thrown out in the garbage. I rely on these tips because my paychecks have been disappointing for weeks now and this is very frustrating to me even if it's just a few dollars for the day. any shift I get is canceled right before I'm supposed to work it but then they will call or text me almost every day to come work a shift on the days I'm scheduled to be off, which I think is just their way of making it seem like they want me there due to what they're doing, despite them knowing I'm definitely not picking up shifts I'm not scheduled for at this point because I know they clearly *don't* want me there. I KNOW they're pushing me to make the decision to quit instead of firing me, probably so that I can't make the step to claim anything due to being fired on unjust grounds, because in my eyes there is nothing wrong with me as a worker or anything I could've done to have this happen to me. I get my work tenacity from my father so I go above and beyond for my customers. I'm fast, friendly, and I've gotten numerous compliments about my performance from customers including a few that say I'm they're favorite which really brightens my day.

I don't want to have to leave this job because I really like it and the perks that come with it, and there's really not many places I can apply to right now, the area I live in is small and most jobs are filled. this is also a terrible time of year to be looking for work. is it worth talking to my job at this point? or should I just say screw it and claim my severance pay and really hunker down on job hunting in the meantime until something opens up?",1646129003.0

32M. With a partner and no kids. Will be moving to another state and taking time off from working.

-Currently working for a Fortune 500 company (several billion in net revenue per year). Was given a 1% wage increase last year, and a 3% today. My bonus was cut by 30% compared to last year. 

-My hours have dramatically increased as has my responsibility now that most of my department has quit. I am constantly told how essential I am to the accounting department and am begged not to leave (everyone was quitting at the same time this year). Yet, I am given a 3% wage increase which essentially is a paycut given that inflation is 7.5%. My annual reviews were outstanding and documented. I’m wanting to quit because my company refuses to embrace remote work even though we have done excellent for the past two years working remote during COVID. I want to participate in this movement as I feel very strongly that no matter what position you are in financially or at a company, workers won’t be pushed around anymore. I want to send a message and I can do that by putting in my notice as soon as the bonus deposits. I won’t take pay-cuts any longer. I’m all in on this movement.

Anyway, I knew the weak merit increase was coming so I’ve been hoarding cash for a year now to plan my much-needed time off from working. I only plan on taking a couple months off and will have little expenses (will be living with someone for a short-time rent-free. If needed, I can go 18 months on my savings and not have to work if I wanted to. So financially, I should be okay. Just no health insurance. 

But the closer I get to putting in the notice next week, the more I am feeling anxious about quitting. I’m giving up a good living (100K/year), with health insurance and 401(k) matching, remote for 3 of the 5 days and office for two days, and am stable. But So many other people are struggling and not making anywhere close to that. I am fortunate and am constantly feeling guilty that I would give up a 6 figure job when others don’t even make a quarter of that an are struggling to make ends me. The risk adverse side of me says to just stay where I am and continue doing what I’ve been doing (albeit unhappy). But the other side of me wants to give the middle finger to my company and quit to send a message and further participate in this movement.

Could really use some encouragement in my decision. 

TL;DR:  I have the opportunity, financially, to quit my $100K job and take some much needed time off from working. I want to send a message to my company for making me take a pay cut for the 2nd year in a row despite my performance and increased workload. But I am having 2nd thoughts given how many other people are struggling and how risk adverse I am.",1646100622.0

I’m in marketing.

So I’ve been employed at this place for about a year now.

I’m severely underpaid and severely overworked (23-27 clients I managed a month.)

I build something like 80+ pages a month plus graphic design plus working their sketchy backlink farm…

The work was insane and in order to keep up I often worked weekends and nights. I had no work life balance.

I informed the CEO other companies were making offers of more pay and less clients. He informed me that there was simply no room for growth here and that unless the company got more clients, this was it.

On top of this, my boss has no experience in this industry. She’s clueless. And she overloads you to no end with work. She would call me just to complain about random things and meetings consistently ran over time or went off topic for her to rant about different things.

So finally I received an offer of around $13k a year more and it’s a much better company with a clear path to grow, so I took it. This company is also huge and well known in this particular industry. And my boss is VERY well aware of who they are.

I left my current company a review on indeed around this time.

I informed my boss today, who called me and said she was “so disappointed” in me and that I should have told her. 

She said I was “rude and hurtful for leaving a bad review on indeed” and that I made her look “like an idiot”.

She ask tried to tell me I wasn’t allowed to work for this new company because they are a competitor, and I need this companies permission.

Then she tried to say it was my fault for not telling her I was over worked. I told her, you told me yourself you knew I was working weekends and nights, and you still said you wanted to give me more clients. 

How do you expect a human being to work 30 some clients a month plus all the other work you assign?! It isn’t doable. And I’m not the only one having issues.

She went in about “you’ve never spoken to me this way before!” And tried to say that I could have been a manager…

I informed her that I knew the pay for the manager as I had seen it on indeed. The manager made the same exact pay I did. It wasn’t worth it. 

She said I could have been a account manager. I informed her I also saw the account manager position on indeed and it only made 1k a year more than me for a ton more work. 

I figured this conversation was it until the CEO of the company rage emailed me to say I had broken the rules of the employee handbook by reviewing them on indeed and that I was breaking my NDA because I was leaving for a competitor and knew too many “proprietary secrets”.

Funny enough, I never signed the handbook. And the NDA says I’m free to quit without notice I just can’t go around telling people that THIS SPECIFIC COMPANY payed me xyz amount and this is all their internal processes.” 

Funny enough, the new company was aware of my current company and had zero interest in anything to do with them as “they don’t really know what their doing anyway.” According to the new company. 
 

But long story short, the ceo of the new company informed me he would be getting lawyers involved and sue me for financial restitution if I tell the new company anything, and that I save him from terminating me. Plus he’s going to tell the new company how horrible I am.

And they wonder why I’m leaving….",1646094632.0

I got into an accident getting off the highway which caused $2500 in damages to my vehicle. 

It’s going to take me 5 weeks of take home pay to recover the costs. 

On top of that they’ve been impossible about WFH, doing everything they can (short of paying for damages or providing a rental) to get me back into the office. 

I had to force my way into getting WFH in January when my spouse had a CONFIRMED POSITIVE COVID TEST. And the only reason I got that was because I refused to come in. 

This place is a complete joke and fucking pain in my ass. They underpay, overwork, and give completely shit benefits.

I’m out. I’ve already convinced 2 other people to look for other jobs, and one other has already moved on (after a 3 month employment) because I showed him enough reasons to leave.

I'm a freelancer and, while I love the work I do and the flexibility freelancing offers, there are a few things that are beginning to wear me down:

1. Feeling unvalued. I have zero sense of job security and was once just completely ghosted by a company after having worked with them for a year. They told me multiple times they were happy with my work! Every connection and client I have feels so fickle. Like I could lose it at any moment.


2. Groveling for work. 50% of the time I get offered projects but the other 50% I have to ask for work. It's always like pulling teeth. I'll ask if they have any projects and they'll say ""let me check."" I'll wait a week, not hear anything back, then follow up. Then on the follow up they might have something for me. 


3. Feast or famine. It seems that I either have no work at all or I'm buried because I have to take on everything that I can to make up for the time I didn't have work. I would fucking love consistent work so I don't have to worry in the down times and kill myself working when I do have work. 


I feel like I can't address any of these issues because I'm not an employee for these companies I work for. I tried once and was essentially just brushed off. I don't want to approach the issue again because they don't even have to fire me. They just have to quit contacting me. 


Any advice is greatly appreciated.

At first I panicked because I never normally answer to unknown phone calls, but when I answer, the most rude individual I have ever dealt with starts shouting at me for:
1) Not responding to her phone calls (even AFTER telling her I was at class)
2) Not responding to her email (SHE NEVER SENT ONE, I CHECKED MY SPAM FOLDER AS WELL)
3) When she tells me what the offer is, and I refuse it, she starts shouting at me how I am not responsible enough to go for a career and I am not bold enough to make ""investment"" desicions. Keep in mind that this ""internship"" is a year to 18 months long with a ""possibility"" of a small bonus (around 100$) and a full time offer at the end if my work was satisfactory.

I decide to, logically, stop the call. Then, she keeps calling in again nonstop so I get forced to remove my SIM card from my phone. 4 days , when I inserted it back, this rude ""specialist"" was still calling (at 1 AM no least), so I block her number. She starts calling from other numbers so I block them too.
After calling from 14 different numbers, the calls stop and the emails start. Luckily since I gave them my university email, I contacted the IT and told them to redirect all mail from that company to spam. They luckily agreed after telling them my story.

When a patron would complain at one of my other jobs I was one of the first people they saw and yelled at. I would attempt to fix their problem and have them leave in a better mood. But nothing would work at calming them down better than a supervisor who was wearing business casual or sometimes a fun tshirt with khakis. 
It feels like people just see the green apron or Walmart vest or whatever your uniform is and that's all you are to them, a uniform. I get having a uniform so people know who works at a store but why is every uniform gray, brown, and store color. 

(Also I hate wearing jeans but they're so vilified in ""professional culture"". I never understood why, they're just pants.)",1646073374.0

This was roughly a year ago. I had a very quick climb on the career ladder into the research department of a medium sized company (2000\~ employees globally).

This was the first real Job I had after a bunch of internships at that company and writing my thesis there. The thesis turned out to be very useful which enabled a lot of cool opportunities which to me back then sounded amazing. I had a lot of responsibilities and a say at the big guys table, which felt great. My pay was still shitty, but I got promised more regularly, so it was fine to me. Also, since all those internships and my thesis and all, and the projects I worked on were pretty much my ""babies"", I had what you would call loyalty to that company.

After an amazing first year there, I was euphoric, I was ready to give it all.. and my boss noticed. I got more and more stuff on my plate. Projects that were far too big for a still super young employee and a team of 5-6 people, of which 2 were pretty much just sales and management. Since those guys weren't technically inclined, I had to manage client calls and support, while developing the product, while still reading recent papers and planning the next thing since it was still under the flag of a ""research"" department.

I am gonna be honest, a lot of that stuff was me being able to polish a turd, because at some point, it was impossible to maintain the ever increasing workload with actual quality.

So I was using my regular working hours to get on client calls, prepare talks and presentations and demos, planning what to do next and after hours, when people were finally out the office, I had some time to finally actually code the projects I was on. During this time, my shortest work days were like 10 hours, my longest I literally slept on a couch in the office.

Best part is, I never got compensated for overhours. Company policy was no more than 10h a day unless it was planned and reported beforehand and a bunch of paperwork was done. Which I would have needed everyday pretty much. So I had this stealth agreement with my boss that I could just write down my overhours and have them as extra vacation, which I could take off once it became a little more quiet. Which of course never happened. On the contrary. This agreement had the great side effect of enabling me to work on weekends, public holidays and maybe the funniest, my own vacation days. But man did I get praise for my work ethic. From time to time I even got a ""you need to take a day off now and then"", which pretty much meant I had to do that work whenever I came back because no one ever took over.

As a thanks I got promotions and even more responsibilities and small bonuses at the end of the year (Not even close to being worth it) but raises were always postponed to ""really soon, but budget is really tight right now""

BTW at the annual christmas party, the boss had a slideshow prepared where he's shown us all of his vintage cars (we are talking over 20 Cars, most of which no one of us will ever have the spare money to afford), crazy expensive vacations and restaurant visits - you know, just to establish some familiarity and get to know him and his personal life. This, in no way, was just a flex and the fact that promised raises were postponed for over a year due to ""difficult financial times"" meant this was surely the best time to do this little tour through his crib.

After I got another project to support in a different timezone, which meant I had scheduled calls around the clock now, I asked for some support for the team, which of course was promised but never came. I had to client support and dev a project that could easily keep an entire team busy, for months and months on end, begging for support every week.

This was the time when I noticed that my behaviour and my body changed. I got angry and irritable. My heartbeat randomly raced through the roof. I could not sleep for the life of me, even though I was extremely exhausted. Just didnt happen. Multiple nights every week were straight up all-nighters.

At some point something clicked. I stared right through my computer screen and couldn't get a single task done. Not even the easiest ones that would have been muscle memory at that point. This happened once, then again, then this was the norm. I just. Couldn't. My attention span was zero, my ability to concentrate on the most mundane task was all of a sudden nonexistant. I blamed it all on me and was terribly embarrassed anyone would find out. The calls luckily still worked, so I could talk myself out of stuff, but this couldn't have kept going. So I called in sick, wrapped myself inside a blanket like a burrito and didnt move from my couch for weeks, except to order takeout and go to the bathroom. I came back for a day just to call in sick again immediately. Luckily COVID and Home-Office made flying under the radar easier, but my Boss bombarded my business phone in the meantime. After about 3 months of this, I called him, I noticed that He struggled to keep his voice down and asked me when I would return. I told him that I wouldnt.

This is when I actually got the raise offered that I wanted. And a new business phone. And a Bonus. But at that point that could have been millions, I was just done and I knew If I ever set foot in that office again, I would kill myself.

Another 3 months later, I started a new job. Almost 100% pay raise, an actual team to work with, and barely any overhours. Super chill and still even more productive due to people actually sharing responsibilities. I still feel the late effects of my former job, but luckily a steady sleeping cycle and strict working hour rules are making me better every day.

Maybe what I am trying to say is, guys, you wont become elon musk by being employed and paid a shitty wage. Don't work your ass off for that carrot on a stick",1646041974.0
t2xl7r,I’ve been suspended pending a meeting with my regional manager for taking my lunch break. Is this legal?,,1613,0.97,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/t2xl7r/ive_been_suspended_pending_a_meeting_with_my/,123,"I work your typical 9 hour work day. I’m supposed to get an hour for lunch, but there’s nobody to cover me, so if I take a lunch break I end up having to stay late to catch up on work. Can count on one hand how many lunch breaks I’ve taken in 4 years.

I brought it up to my manager and he said “you’re entitled to your lunch, if you work through it that’s your problem”. So I asked if I’m allowed to take it any time and he said yes. 

Fast forward to last week and I started coming in at 9am instead of 8. I’m done working 9 hours. When my manager called to ask where I was I told him “I’m taking my lunch, I’ll be in at 9”. He got very upset when I reminded him he said I could take my break whenever.

So now I’m suspended and I’m wondering if I’ll be fired. I don’t care about the job, I just want to know if they’re legally allowed to suspend/fire me over this and what recourse I have if they do.

Thanks in advance. Fuck work, stay strong, stay healthy. Go Ukraine!!

Edit: Yes I’m aware I’m being malicious/petty. I’ve already got another job lined up. I’m doing this to prove a point and to potentially help my fellow/future colleagues. Nothing in our contract (or provincial legislation) stipulates WHEN I’m entitled to a break, only that I am. 

I’d also like to point out that I have indeed brought this issue up to management/HR several times to deal with it the correct way. It’s gone nowhere and led to me being ostracized by management.",1645995271.0

Anyways during the his time I was sick with something of a head cold. Congestion, lots of mucus, and a bit of a cough.


During this I was just thuging it out and I was still pretty much the top of my training with the trainers being impressed. I don't have a standard computer chair I'm using a small recliner chair so I look a little laid back on the webcam. I have pretty small eyes so at a distance it sometimes looks like my eyes are closed when they are not. Well my trainer asked if I was sleeping and I immediately answered no I'm not, and explained it my look like that but I have small eyes and the positionint of the camera along with the chair may make it seem like I'm not paying attention. Mind you this whole time I've been participating way more than my fellow trainees, reading, answering questions, scoring high on tests and other activities, asking questions, and conversatting with my other trainees when things were open for that. So there was evidence showing I was paying attention and very active. Things seemed great.


So fast forward today my Trainer tells me to contact my agency, I asked why, she says she doesn't know why. Then I'm kicked out of the zoom meeting,, I call my agency and she tells me she doesn't know what's happening, and then says she shows an email saying I'm terminated so SLEEPING in training. With no appeal. Of course I was shocked as well as my agent because it didn't make sense. She tried to appeal but they denied it. It almost feels like it was personal. I've never been fired for such a thing, and much more for such a petty thing that I didn't even do.


It's as if corporations expect you to be more than human, even if I was to have dosed off a little, that's still an extremely weird ass reason to fire someone, especially someone who was found to be above average at the job. The world is stressful, people are tired. How little empathy and understanding do you have to fuck off someone like that?",1646083900.0

I did quite a bit for this company and was pivotal in it's growth.  It will likely do 10M in sales this year, when I started it was 0.5M.  

I'm in a weird position because I started as a contractor / consultant, and as their needs grew I just stepped up, until I was doing the job of 6 people.  It got to be a bit much.  And I still had other clients, and grew those other clients as well.  Late last year during the peak I billed 45k in one month with 5k of overhead.  Which is a bit insane but not sustainable and not enjoyable. 

I think if there is anything this last year has taught me, if we are not enjoying your life then what the hell are we doing?  I got to the point where I had no hobbies, no friends, didn't leave the house much, just worked and took care of kids.  Rinse repeat.  Now I am going to go fishing and maybe do some other things.  It's really easy to jump back in and I already had several interviews as a W2, but I think my days of a W2 is over.  As a W2 you aren't respected and there is no real sense of agency.  You are an employee.  As a 1099 I decide what I can do and can't do, i set reasonable expectations.  ""I can't do this meeting because I'm fishing"".  Stuff like that.  And I managed to do this while making as much money as a W2.  

I left the position because I turned into a glorified store manager meanwhile the owner does nothing and gets literal millions in profit.  It just rubbed me the wrong way. 

Anyway let me know if questions.  This is not an amazing success, but I think this is a different and more sustainable way of doing things, and I feel like I can keep this going for 5 or 10 more years.",1646094968.0
