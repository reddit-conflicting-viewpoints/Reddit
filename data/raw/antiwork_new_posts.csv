FUCK DOLLAR GENERAL!!!!,5,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spooqn/let_me_just_say_fuck_dollar_general/,1,"Just got wrongly accused and terminated today for ""stealing"" I told the LP guy straight up I didn't steal anything and It's a fucking dollar store. There's nothing here worth stealing and risking your job over. He say's ""I'm not accusing you of stealing, there's just some behaviors going on in the store that need to stop"". He said I ""saw"" my co-worker steal milk and didn't say anything. UM hello? I was in the back changing the trash when she came in and put two gallons of milk from upfront and put them in the back freezer telling me she would buy them later. later in the night I go back there with her and we walk up to the register and I CHECK HER OUT AND HANDED HER THE RECIPT all under camera. The lp guy went over a few other things and asked me to sign a statement (which I probably shouldn't have but I just wanted to get rid of him). about an hour later he comes in with the district manager and they fire me stating ""not protecting company assets"". I was pissed. I did no wrong. my co-worker did no wrong. This was all out of the blue I had no idea this was being set up. The milk was fucking paid for!

I busted my ass for 3 years for this company. Never called off once. Always came in early. I went above and beyond and this is the thanks I'm Given?

spoo2t,"PSA: If you have student loans on deferment or forbearance, please check your credit reports immediately. They might be affecting your score.",1,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spoo2t/psa_if_you_have_student_loans_on_deferment_or/,0,"Because here's my situation:

So a while ago, I looked on my credit reports and noticed that my student loans were listed.

Now I left this alone for a while because my loans have been deferred for some time now. I haven't graduated yet due to unique circumstances, so I didn't think it would affect my score.

And then the other day, I looked more into my reports...

I can now see that one of the reasons my future applications for credit can be denied is due to me having outstanding loan balances. That reasoning was not listed when I last checked.

But I don't have outstanding loan balances. My student loans are deferred and all of my other debts on the reports are paid off. No other loans are listed.

I am currently in the process of correcting this. And I don't want sympathy, I just want as many people as possible to know about this. I knew loan servicers are predatory, but this is a new low from my personal experience. This is frustrating, but can I truly be surprised at this point?

And also, as I was just wrapping up this post draft, apparently my loans are not on deferment anymore. I just looked and they're actually on forbearance now. Which means that my loans have been accruing interest for a while.

Loans are only supposed to be paid back once a person graduates and is hired for employment, which I'm working on. I've never been hired for a full-time job yet my loans switched from deferment to forbearance. Yeah, that's a problem

Needless to say, I'll be contacting my loan servicer tomorrow. I'll update this post about the situation whenever I figure things out.

Check those reports!",1644548899.0

spoiop,Pay Me Less My Guy,3,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spoiop/pay_me_less_my_guy/,0,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

So I was finishing up college in the midwest. It was the spring semester of 2020 and I had accepted a position with a company of a couple hundred people in a small town in the middle of nowhere, hours away from where I was currently living. I asked for compensation slightly above average for grads from my college program. I had pretty good grades and internship experience . I ended up agreeing on $1k less than the average. A month later COVID hits and I get told I would be placed on hiring freeze until August. Alright, I guess just something I’ll have to live with. Well the beginning of June rolls around and I get called and asked if I could start at the beginning of July. But they need me to take a 10% pay cut through the end of the year. The one question I ask, “Is everyone in the company taking a pay cut?”. “Yes” is the reply from my potential boss on the other end of the line. I think, if everyone is doing it then I guess I can live with it. What else was a guy to do? The job market was completely dead and the outlook of finding another job anytime soon was bleak.

Fast forward to getting hired. I get presented with a new job contract with my new pay and told to sign. I look and the pay cut isn’t quite 10%. It’s rounded to the nearest thousand. I begin to think something is fishy, but I sign the contract. I start training and all seems fine and once I start to meet a few new coworkers I get comfortable enough with them to start poking around. “How have things been here since Covid? Any negative impacts on the business?” I find out they laid off a bunch of people right when it had started, but am told that COVID was probably used as a guise to fire people that weren’t great workers or didn’t fit well with the company. Interesting. No mention of pay cuts though. The next day I get worked up enough to ask one of my coworkers I was starting to become friends with about pay cuts point blank. “What pay cuts?” Is the response I receive. I then explain to him how I’m getting fucked over. He then tells me about how he was one of the people who were laid off. And they brought him back in different position.

I finish my job training the rest of the week without mentioning anything again to anyone and start in my new position while trying to figure out if saying anything to my boss will do anything to benefit me. He lied to my face before I ever started. Why would he have any moral compass to make things right? And although my blood is boiling and I want to quit this job immediately but I’m hesitant. I mean what sort of future do you really have with a company that’s going to do whatever is in their best interest and doesn’t mind if they have to fuck you to do it? But Covid is a thing and the job market is still dead. And no one wants to hire a college grad with two weeks of experience so where am I going to go? So I stay in my job and vow to never do more than the bare minimum job requirement for this company.

As far as my job goes it completely sucks and I dread coming to work every day. It is nothing like what my expectations were and the work is mind numbingly shit. I’m not working on half the stuff I was told I would be either. Mind you it doesn’t help that I’ve moved to a new town where I know nobody. My 2 year girlfriend and I broke up prior to the move. And any opportunity for meeting people is nonexistent with Covid in full effect. Oh and not to mention I’m living in a hotel until I find a spot to live. I stop looking for apartments though the minute I learn I’m being lied to because I refuse to have anything keeping me at this shit job. I let this be the state of my life for far too long and end up living in the hotel for seven months basically in a state of depression the whole time suffering through the shit job. 

Then the end of the year comes. At my end of the year review I get bumped back up to my pay I was suppose to receive when I started. I find out my job will be changing drastically and I see this as a big time positive. I actually start to not dread coming to work. I decide to give the job a chance for another year and commit to the town and job. I get an apartment and life starts to seem better. But it’s always in the back of my head. They lied to me and fucked me over so why put much effort into my work? Why meet their deadlines? I lose any motivation to develop in my career because I don’t want the company to benefit from it.

I see them fuck over many people while I’m there for the year and a half. They try to get the only HR person in the company for the last 8 years to take a 5 digit pay cut because they hired someone over her to run the department. She was smart enough to give them the bird and find a new job. I watched them give a management position to someone within the company who gets trained in and works the position for three months only to have the higher ups change their minds not long after. I watch them fire a guy two weeks before Christmas because they don’t want to pay him any of the time he’d be off. Nonstop turnover at certain positions and job postings that are open for months because the company won’t raise their pay rates. Not to mention horrible benefits. And a lot of people who work here don’t care about their job because most people are looking to get out. But it’s a small town and there aren’t many opportunities nearby.

Fast forward to the end of 2021. Time for my end of the year review. My boss tells me everything has been good. My works been good. They’re happy with my progress. They hand me a sheet to show me my new salary. It’s a 4.7% raise... the equivalent of core inflation for the year. I get told I’m getting a $1500 bonus to bring my salary up to where it should have been for the past year (because of the company not reaching profit sharing goals.) I tell him I’m not happy with that. I let them know I’m being paid less than the average college grad from my school would be projected to be making and I’ve been working there for a year and a half. You’re happy with the work I’ve done so I think I should be making a little more than the next warm body that walks through the door. I also let my boss know I’m aware that I was lied to. My boss wants to talk with upper management and get back to me.

My boss sets up a meeting a couple days later and leads off asking me how long I’ve known they lied to me. Then tells me it doesn’t help anyone to be resentful for the year and half I’ve worked there. Deflects blame onto upper management although the words came from my bosses mouth and then goes back to pretending nothing ever happened. They then slide me my new salary offer. They decided to take away my bonus and add $2k to the salary. Basically the equivalent of telling me to go fuck myself. Then tells me I haven’t been developing as well as they thought I’d be, contradicting everything they said in my initial meeting. My boss then has the audacity to tell me I received a big raise of 11% the previous year and asks if I’m expecting double digit raises every year. I also get fed the line that they gave everyone around the same percentage raise and that my boss considers us all equal in the department. Also try’s to say profit sharing is part of my salary even though it’s not guaranteed money as was proven that previous year by receiving nothing for three quarters. Also tells me I shouldn’t be making a certain amount of money because they had to work 7 years before making that amount of money. My boss obviously has zero grasp on the concept of inflation. 

 For the last month I have given less fucks than ever at that job. I have no incentive to work hard because “everyone gets treated equal in our department”.  Currently on pace to miss a month long deadline by at least a week. I can’t get past the fact I’m getting fucked repeatedly. I’m tired of showing up everyday and not giving a single fuck about what I do. The job search has begun but no matter what I’m getting out of this toxic shit hole when my lease is up in a couple months. 

Thought I’d share and let everyone know always do what’s best for you. Employers will fuck you the second they get the chance. And don’t stick with a company that doesn’t respect you. I would have rather been out of work since the beginning of covid than turned into the nihilistic prick I’ve become because of this company and the asshats who manage it.

spoilx,"Manager tried to give exit interview, I refused, was asked to leave.",4,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spoilx/manager_tried_to_give_exit_interview_i_refused/,2,"Longtime lurker first time poster, sorry for the long ass post😬 So I quit my job over the summer to start a business with my brother, took some time off in between, and a good friend contacted me and asked if I could come help out. He manages a quick lube place, and his techs all up and quit one day(painfully obvious why now.) He got in touch and said he would start me at what I was making at my previous job and said it was even negotiable. He said I was worth that much and more but that he couldn’t do much better than that because of the position. I knew it was kind of an entry level position so I was fine with the cap. I mulled it over for a few days and signed on as a temporary thing. One thing led to another and the business with my brother fizzled out because I was dedicating myself to this job for now. Kind of sucked but I figured, oh well I’ll do this for a bit and find something else down the road more permanent. It was good for a while, he hired some other techs and we were getting the shop going again. I noticed pretty quickly that it was a pretty toxic place and that’s probably what the previous mutiny was about. I started looking a bit for something else, and was waiting to here back about a new opportunity at my previous employer. The longer I was there the more the other techs were getting fed up/offended by his verbal abuse/sporadic moods. It was getting really bad, I had to get out. I found another job and put in my notice. He pulled me aside today and said we had some paperwork to do, I said what kind of paperwork and followed him to the back room. He hands me some exit interview paperwork and I said what’s this? He says just standard stuff for corporate. I said shouldn’t someone who’s not my direct supervisor conduct the exit interview? He says no, that’s not how this works, to which I replied well that just seems grossly inappropriate to me, shouldn’t hr do this? He said I am hr, I said no you’re the manager, just because there isn’t a specific “hr” position doesn’t mean there isn’t another more appropriate person to do this at the dealership. It went straight down the gutter from there. He told me how he knew I would be a pain in the ass and not just walk away gracefully, to which I replied I couldn’t live with myself if I let you treat people this way knowing I may be able to change it. He started telling me all the favors he did for me when I was out of work, (he begged me) as if I hadn’t voluntarily left my former employer, (on fantastic terms, in fact the hr rep that conducted my exit interview said if I was ever in need of a job in the future, she had heard nothing but the best, and would absolutely recommend me
for a rehire) trying to say I wasn’t worth what he paid me(I didn’t even negotiate, he started at my current pay rate) I just couldn’t wrap my head around how many absolute bullshit contradictions to past statements, that I knew were flat out fallacies, he was spewing. I got sick of going back and forth as to why it was inappropriate so I walked out of the back room to try to go back to work. He followed me and I kept saying this is why it’s inappropriate for you to do the interview. It serves no purpose for the company going forward if they’re not airing out grievances, be it of outgoing employees or current to, a neutral party. I started getting a little loud because I had said that same thing literally a dozen times or better at that point. He got louder and then said I was causing a scene. I said I was trying to go back to work until my two weeks was up. He said I needed to leave, so I said are you firing me, and he said no you’ve already submitted your resignation, to which I replied, correct which is effective on the 17th, if you wish for me to leave before that date, you are terminating my employment. He said that’s not how that works and I said I think that’s exactly how that works, you’re confused. That went back and forth for another ten minutes and I got sick of his childish shit and said that’s fine I’ll be back later to get my box. When I went back he asked me if I was still being a dick, I said if being honest makes me a dick then I guess so, he said so yes, and I said if you say so I spose🤷🏻‍♂️ I got my shit and said I would like to amend the date on the exit interview that says my last day is the 17th, he looked at me blankly and said what? So I reiterated that he made me leave on this day which is not the last day of my employment per the terms of my resignation, and that I would like that paper to reflect that even if I wasn’t competing his white wash of an exit interview, so I wrote on it that he asked me to leave on this date and wrote it down next to my signature and took a picture of it and left, but not before he told me to go fuck myself…again! What a great boss!!caught him edit my hours down from just over 40 to just under, lest he suffer the consequences of them paying me time and a half for less than one tenth of one hour. Just petty thing after petty thing, with someone who I have been friends with for almost 20 years. Ya think ya know a person… 
Tl;dr longtime friend asked(begged)me to help him fill a spot in his shop, turns out he’s a giant asshole to his employees. Stuck it out for a bit, found something else, put in my two weeks, he tried to give me the exit interview and I had some shit I wanted to air out but not to him, to have it white washed. He got pissy, tried to make me leave before my final day without actually firing me and said that I was incorrect, in that that’s not how that works. accused me of ripping of his time clock and not working/making too much money. kinda just wanted to vent, kinda curious if I’m due unemployment for a couple weeks, kinda wonder if it’s worth pursuing the clock times legally for such a low offense?

After being hired I immediately saw a problem and it was my territory. I spoke with my manager about expanding into other cities and I was met with ""I will get back to you"". After a month of diligently working my territory I get a call from the boss man. Basically he said I was underperforming compared to my class. I fire back: 

The other reps have 200+ quarterly prescriptions they are inheriting. 

There are 20+ demos in field for each clinic in other territories (easy in)

They have a 40+ square mile radius and I have 15 mile radius. (far less opportunity)

I went to my manager (has been remote and when you try to reach her mia) she has been semi-present for a few months) to ask a question and long story short the conversation went well until the very end when I was about to leave. She told me that we need to have a sit down with the owner. I have been with company for 2.5 years and he has been present maybe 5 times (body, not mind) (nobody cares about your wife Jennifer) currently in Florida vacationing, told us all about how he works so hard, even when he is in Florida he works till noon. Work ethic is important that’s what his Dad taught him when he took over the company and everyone needs to be on time (our last meeting was re-scheduled 3 times, with our entire staff) once we finally had it all he talked about was COVID and how it isn’t going anywhere and his retirement, he has an 11 year plan blah blah lol how he is getting another assistant and his son will take over the company and how more or less how we need to make him more money, these assholes don’t show their face when I am ripping out my hair the other 7 months out of the year and my family life suffers (met his son 1 time in the parking lot after he finished a golf outing). I wish I had recorded it. He sounded like a big douche. I can’t even imagine what our new people thought He actually said “I contributed $170k to retirement for the employees the last 5 years” I looked around the room and just couldn’t believe that (25 plus employees) fuck off dude! (He has other business in a neighboring state) that he cares about much more than us, but you think you are the only one that can do simple math?!  So back to my conversation with my manager.  She said we need to talk about your vacation and are going to reduce it. She said I’m getting to much vacation for the amount of hours I’m working. (Background) When I was hired I told owner that I had x amount of clients and they would follow me. Every single client is still with me and brings so much revenue I pull my weight 10 fold. Our understanding was I work when it is busy and I will reduce hours when it is not win/win (he asked me to be salary and I said no (knowing from experience they will work you to the bone) I have a child and want flexibility) Win-win! You would think! No, everyone else at my job works/is there, chats for a few hours throughout the day, but I show up, bring my own clients, get my shit done, don’t milk the clock and leave and am getting about to get my fucking vacation/sick time  PTO fucking taken away because I only average 36 hours. I told her “so I manage my time, am hourly (you save money)!and I don’t milk clock and am willing to do whatever to get my job done and you are penalizing me and going to take away some of the only sanity I get, my time with my family!!!” I get a month, that includes sick etc… I worked throughout this whole fucking shit show with a child (worked and homeschool) and had COVID from home (never got time off when I was miserably sick) to make sure you didn’t have to lift a a finger.

I expressed curiosity and interest in other departments of the company. I had a conversation with someone (maybe 5-10 minutes) and because I did this during a rough period of the company’s recruiting hours, literally specific hours set aside during the day— completely disrupting the work flow that might be worked on— this led to being let go. 
I’m not terribly upset because I knew that I hadn’t seen myself at the company for forever, but it still kinda sucks. 

On top of telling me to get lost and clean out my desk, my manager told me ‘I’d be willing to consider keeping you if you get a contract in the next two weeks’ knowing full and well that I was placed in one of the most difficult and slowest teams of recruitment of our department and movement of the disciplines don’t happen that quickly. Basically, telling me ‘you can come in for the next two weeks to try to make the company more money, but I won’t guarantee that I’d be willing to keep you on, in fact I basically don’t think you can do you might as well clean out your desk now.’  


If you wanted to give me that last opportunity to maintain my position, then would it not make sense to have me clear my desk at the end of the two weeks rather than tonight?
Also— while struggling during some of the toughest months of the year now, I COULD see myself in the company long term but found myself unhappy and struggling in the position that I landed, and sought within the company to maintain structure and to lessen the headache for both of us when filing later— so letting me go for seeking WITHIN THE COMPANY genuinely doesn’t make sense to me. Oh well.  

My entire employment at this company was determined by one person seeing that I wasn’t willing to put in absurd overtime into a salaried position and wanted to find something that  was better for me within the company. Lol

The providers we work with have even stated we should be paid more.

Couple it with horrible management it’s a shit show. Calling people to come in on their off days, taking days to over a week to respond to emails despite needing an immediate response from us, they do not care if you’re busy or not.

Whenever this conversation comes up at work or anywhere really, people always say ""it's only 8 hours"" or ""just stay another hour, its more money"" 

Let me explain something to everyone.

I wake up and i spend 35  minutes to get ready for work.
I clear the snow off my car and warm it up for 5 minutes. 
I spend 35 minutes to go to work and sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes so im not late or too early. 
I clock in, and start working for 9 hours, but i punch out for my 30 minute break so really 9 hours and 30 minutes. 
i finish and let me car warm up for 5 minutes. 
i drive 45 minutes home because i work on a highway the U-turn is 10 minute addition. 
i wash up and get comfy after work for about 30 minutes and wind down. 

lets add up how much time ""work"" really takes up in minutes.
35 + 5 + 35 + 10 + 540 + 30 + 5 + 45 + 30 = 735 / 60= 12 hours and 15 minutes. and i only get paid for 9 of them.

Work is an all day thing. and i have to sleep for 8 hours. 
that gives me about 4 hours a day to cook, clean, have a hobby, make love, shop, etc. What a waste of time.

I just bought a used car too, and it wont always start in cold weather so I spend an a few minutes every morning to see if it will start before i get ready, and if it does i continue. if it doesnt i get the jumper cables and spend an hour trying to maneuver another car in front of mine to jump it let it warm up. 

Just so i can make enough money to just barely afford this car to get me to work. and my mortgage... but thats about it. 
I dont have netflix or internet or anything special, my girlfriend has to pay for that stuff because i cant afford them. I contribute to savings but debt grows faster than savings. Snd surprises come up like i need a new water heater or the baseboard heat is leaking. the other day i went to brush my teeth and the water came out brown... time to spend $500 on a plumber. 

So all in all, ill finish my rant by saying, i live in the tristate area making $70k a year, i can barely keep my head above water and i dont know how you all do it on less in the same area. i help out others where i can but karma hasn't been very nice to me lately. thanks for listening.",1644545026.0

for example, for me it's

1. telling employers/employees how I really feel about work at the moment: when i was 17, i was working in a drugstore. i've only been working for 2 days. it was relatively slow and dead that day and someone asked me how it was going. i answered honestly and said ""it's a little boring but not bad"" at the end of the shift, i was told they would call me when they needed me. they never called me again.
2. calling out for a bathroom break: i drink a lot of water and naturally, go to the bathroom a lot. a former employer asked me if i have bladder issues and to maybe stop drinking so much water.
3. asking for changes in schedules: thankfully, my current job is pretty understanding of when i can work because i'm still in school. however, a few years back, i was working in a museum rather far from my house. i worked closing shifts and would get home close to midnight. my parents were concerned and asked me to change to opening instead. i agreed and went to talk to my manager about it. she said she would do something about it and never did. on christmas day a month later, she fired me because i ""kept complaining"" about the hours. i only brought it up twice to her.
4. using my phone at work: the big one. most of the places i worked at had a no-phone policy. regardless, i still used my phone. one time, though, i got caught and got suspended from work (same manager from #2) i wasn't really using my phone per say, but i did check the time a lot. even though my current job requires us to check phones (we use the Slack app) i still feel like a kid in high school hiding my phone whenever the managers are near.

I'm a landscape designer, basically all I do is draw on my iPad and create nice little illustrations that depict the species and arrangement, etc. to help close the deal on a landscaping job. I do a lot of work from home to try and meet deadlines. I am very new, and so the first week I really wasn't going to push it about getting every single hour, as I didn't wanna risk pissing my boss off and most of it was experimentation and playing around on the iPad, figuring out the process.

But now, I find I'm still doing a lot of work from home (about 5 hours most weeks). I got COVID a while back and worked from home, texted my boss about how to log my hours and told him how much I worked and he said ""talk with me tomorrow"". I forgot to and have just been hesitant. Paycheck came and my home hours weren't logged. And today he has me working from home to finish a job before tomorrow. I texted him and asked him again, since I neglected to meet with him about it, once again he said ""get with me tomorrow"".

I'm getting strong vibes that he is not down with it, since it requires trusting the employee to be honest about the hours. How should I prepare for this? I am *not* going to continue to work from home if he flat out refuses to ever pay me for it but I worry this could piss him off. He's a workaholic and a stern guy, although he is pleasant and likes me for the most part. I greatly improved their designs since I've been drawing for years. He is very pleased with my work and I've became the main designer in just a month of working there. I don't mind finishing something up here and there for 30 min or so, but if he is specifically asking me to do multiple hours of work, as a busy ass engineering student, that is a sacrifice and I expect to get paid.

Let me preface this by saying I’m in construction and my job sites are usually (45-1hr 30) away from my house. I’m usually there before any of my coworkers most days because I work at 7 A.M and I leave around 5:15-5:30 to go to work and wait in my car until 7, I do this mainly to beat traffic and to gradually start my day.

Yesterday however we were told to be there at 7:30 AM so I decided I’d leave my house at a time that would get me there around 7:20. 

I get there AT 7:30, grab my tools and go see my foreman. He tells me (insert supervisors name here) had just left at 7:25 and he has been waiting on me to show up and told him when yungquaalude shows up call me.

I get this information relayed to me and decided I would just call him myself. I then started getting a lecture about how “I was late and I need to leave earlier because that’s not acceptable.” I cut him off to tell him I wasn’t late I arrived at the specified time and the argument ensued for the next 20 min to the point I had tears in my eye from the level of rage I had reached. 

To sum up the phone call these were the key points made by him
1. 7:30 is the time you need to be on a ladder ready to do work.
2. Your tools are you’re responsibility and taking them out of your car needs to be done before the specified time
3. Somehow also sad that I don’t have equal rights (“you can’t do what everyone else can”) 

I pointed out the facts of the matter being
1. I could leave my house to be 30 minutes early yet a couple of car crashes and I’ll be an hour late and you can’t account for that
2. I’m not going to be here for free if you want me here before the specified time to get ready for work then you need to pay me for that time

Etc etc.

So not only does he expect me to be there before the specified time which I usually am but to also do work for free. 

I just can’t fathom why he thought I would just “yes sir, sorry sir” my way through our conversation. All I can do is tell him that’s bullshit and keep trucking, fuck right to work states.",1644543545.0

I’ve worked both sides of the contract in one career, our union members supervise another unionized workforce, and I later became a manager there. In the other it’s strictly on the labour side. So I’ve seen up close, the shitty things management and labour do to each other while the customers finish up the trifecta in a 3 way knife fight. 

All of that aside, no matter what, there were rules and any worker could, if not a lot else, expect to be treated fairly and equally by the company. The only difference is your seniority date when it’s time to crew. 

So since my early 20s, I’ve basically never worked for, answered to, or been the voice of “the owner”. The owner in one job was is an ever shifting conglomerate and their shareholders, and the other job the owner is 🇨🇦.

We stayed in touch and she told me she found out there was a hidden camera and microphone that allowed them to monitor every move I made, everything I said, and every interaction I had with coworkers who came by my office.  They were also monitoring every website I visited and did screenshots.

This was verified by an IT person who was also fired.

Luckily my whole industry is funded by taxes so we must be transparent, but I remember being frustrated by this in the past and I wonder: 

Job seekers: do you find it a waste of time when you interview for jobs only to find out the wages are insufficient? Does the lack of transparency in a company create a lack of trust? 

Hiring parties: do you find it a waste of time to review and interview candidates who might not have applied if given this information? Would transparency establish more trust and value during a time when companies are competing for labor? How does shielding salary range information benefit the customer, employee, applicant or company as a whole? Why is a law necessary? I’m very curious!

It’s dumb, because I know the schedule wasn’t written yet.

I’m cool with working any other holiday. But V-Day? I hate this stupid “holiday”. It’s just commercialism for corporations to profit drain people.

If you’re in a relationship, you should love and take care of your partner EVERYDAY, not just one day of the calendar year.

Even Christmas is commercialized, but it at least has an important meaning behind it (both from a religious POV and not religious).

It’s bad enough having to see couples in a relationship on a daily basis, it hurts me. But an entire day ALL ABOUT IT???

At Kroger, they make everything a big deal. All it is for the corporation is about money, just like everything else. They want me there to help because it’s busy, guess what? I care more about myself than that, even though I hate myself and don’t really care about myself.

I don’t want to be around other people on that day, I want to lock myself in my room and be by myself. 

They’ll probably want me to go help in that tent, to make things even worse. Weirdly it didn’t bother me the last few years (that I can remember) but I guess I was just still more hopeful that there was hope for me to have a loving girlfriend, and more hopeful about life in general.

I already told supervisor I have a doctor appointment on that day (I don’t). They said since the schedule is already written, I’d have to switch shifts with someone. The people I asked today already work on V-Day.

If I call in sick, they’ll know I’m faking now. If I stick to the “doctors appointment”, and insist I can’t go in, they might try to make me either come in for a few hours later, or provide a doctor note.

I hate that my life has even come to this point, I’m too old for this (job and life circumstances ending me up here) but exposing myself to all the people who can actually get into relationships won’t be some “exposure therapy” for me, it’ll only put me in a 1000x worse mindset and mood.

I really don’t even care if I get written up, I’ve never been written up and you get 3 before termination, right? I kind of want to be fired, but I just don’t know what I’d do next, so I’d really rather not get fired.

Like, if I call in or insist I CANNOT miss my doctor appointment, and I don’t provide a doctor note (unless my doctor can write one even though I’m not actually seeing them at this time) what’s the worst that’ll happen to me?

I’m trying to keep the concept of “romantic and sexual” relationships out of my mind, I’m trying to suppress my desire for that from any women, because I’m ugly and work at Kroger (bagging and pushing carts, even worse).

I seriously might have some kind of outburst or meltdown, it’s just too much to keep bottled up.

I don’t really care about this job that much, it’s dead end, for years on end they’ll keep you at the bottom, and there is really no level that is really great. I’d rather be dead anyway, I feel if I quit or get fired I might have to seriously be ready to end my life, because I can’t seem to do better and I can’t deal with the consequences, whether my situation is my fault or not.

I’m not just an employee, I’m an effing human being, even though I don’t really feel like one.",1644541603.0

So I will start with the cons of my job. To start, the pay is not great, the commute sucks, I recently discovered I make the same amount as someone who has worked there for 12 years (I’ve been there 3 years), sometimes I do work email outside of work because my work email is on my phone because they give me money every month for “phone reimbursement”, I could keep lost stuff but I want to get on to the pros.
The pros are that I am great at what I do, I love everybody that I work with including my supervisor, I have some freedom in this place to walk away (still doing my job just need to be outside or in another building) and no one questions me or accuses me of wasting time, they are very flexible if I need a last minute day off and overall I actually get a lot of exercise!
Overall I generally like my job but I guess the biggest things is I wish I was getting paid more and when I “window shop” for jobs online it seems like there are similar jobs around that pay minimum $5 more an hour and I guess what I’m looking for from this post is should I consider looking for a job when I actually don’t hate my job? My bills are getting paid and I can put a small amount of money in savings every paycheck but I don’t think me and my fiancé will be able to ever get a house or support children if I stay at this job.
Also, to note that last week I sat down with some higher ups and asked if they would consider giving me a raise because I’ve been doing another persons job while he’s been “sick” for the last month and a half and all they told me was “it was always agreed that I would help pick up any responsibilities from anyone that is out” which I always felt would only include a day or two of coverage not a month..

This company will be referred to as ""🍕"" .

I started working at 🍕 about 6 months ago. I live with my parents and grandmother. I thought I should contribute to the house more so I started looking for jobs. As per usual, apply to a hundred and see 4 responses back.

🍕 Called me a week after applying. I was doing dancing with my hamsters from the excitement. I show to my interview. GM interviews me. 

Asks me things like:

Age?

Address?

Availability?

I was nervous as fuck. Like classroom presentation nervous.

She goes on about how she had to fire almost all previous staff due to lack of work and presentation. ""So obviously I'm going to hire you."" Bruh, got a job under 5mins.

*Skip to 3 months later*

This 🍕 location is wildin. Employees stealing, threatening, quiting. . .and I'm still there. I mind my business.

*Skip to 2 months later*

GM is breaking. I see it in her. I feel her. 6 people gone in one week. ONE FREAKING WEEK! And I'm still there. A few weeks later she puts her two weeks in. They wouldn't let her step down as GM, quitting was somewhat her only option out. I like her and only really stayed because despite me hating being around others . . .I can't watch a person struggle and do nothing.

GM quits midway through her two weeks. I'm still here. 

New GM will be referred to as NGM. NGM is pretty cool. Except that one time she said I reminded her if the ""Meh emoji"" (fuck her for that). I'm getting paid $12 as a CRS thanks to old GM's raise. I have one week left. 

NGM comes up to me while I'm prepping. She tries to convince me to stay. Offers me $13 and morning shift. (For those who don't know, morning shift at a pizza place is basically heaven)

Fuck it. I took the deal. $13 an hour as csr, not too bad. Well the job still sucks ass. I'm stressed the fuck out. Like I'm *STRESSING*. I'm exhausted. I'm worn. I'm breaking. I'm being stepped on and I'm not doing anything about it.

*Current months*

It's happening again. Shitty scheduling. Me, manager, and one driver (my mom 💕). Imagine having one driver 9-5 on a SATURDAY!!!!! I don't like see my mom being put through that. 

Managers go on smoke breaks every fucking 20mins. Leaving me all alone in a store. I'm 5ft 98lbs, I'm basically a stick. What if something happens while they were smoking weed or cancer by the back door? I had dreams of people placing phone orders and then threatening to shoot up 🍕 because I messes up a little. 

I want to leave. And where to do I wish to go? The dollar store. Dollar tree will probably pay me 11-12. Its a 15min walk from home to there. Not bad, I can save for a car. As I'm planning this, I ask my best buddy to call and ask if the dollar tree is hiring. She said the manager said ""YES!"" with excitement. Good. Now to apply.

Guess what. A few hours later NGM comes to me while I'm prepping. ""I'm going to train you to be a level one assistant manager""

.༎ຶ‿༎ຶ. My plan . . .

She told me as an assistant manager I would have to step in if the scheduled manager couldn't show up. That's when she lost me. I knew what was going to happen. I had a whole *that's so Raven* moment. I was going to be abused. ""*I can't come in, can you cover me?*"" ""*I need you to come in right now*"". I don't want that. I don't want that responsibility. I've been offered to be a morning manager and everytime I turned down. I don't want to *take care* of customers or employees. 

Before this gets too long I'll stop now.

I need to see another's persons view on this. One friend says I'm picky, another says go for it, and my best bud told me to make a run for the hills.

Yesterday, I watched a public board meeting where teachers were crying and begging for a raise. As of this school year, there are 40 teacher vacancies throughout the district. As such, teachers are being forced to give up release time in order to cover for those vacancies....Because there are also no substitutes applying. This means that now more than ever, teachers are spending more personal time doing work stuff. All at the same pay rate, which mind you, hasn't seen an increase in over a decade. On top of this, the district's pressure to bring students back on track to meet standards is ever increasing. Teachers are getting burnt out and looking for employment elsewhere... 

Yet, the district is reluctant to make any changes. They pass motions to put bandaids on sores but refuse to attack the problem at the root. 

Here is an example: Substitute applications are being waived so more people are inclined to apply. At some point a sub could only work for a specific class for no more than 30 days per year. That was increased to 60, and now more recently to 120 days, making long-term positions more feasible. Being a long term sub (LTS) also means better pay. But there are no benefits to the job. Being a LTS means you have ALL the responsibility of a teacher -- preparing lessons, carrying out assessments, filing out paperwork, IEPs if necessary, intervention forms... and you get all the same pressures : why aren't your students up to standards, why haven't you submitted this, haven't done that? All without any support if you need it, because everyone is being stretched thin. Here's the kicker... you catch COVID at school and you have to miss work, guess what? You ain't at work means you ain't getting paid. But since you are a LTS, you need to leave sub plans for the 5-6 different teachers who will be coming in to cover your class while you are gone. What? 


This is a shit show. 

Idk what's going to happen to the education system in our area. It's all collapsing. And the fix is so simple...  Offer a livable wage and more people might decide that teaching is the career path for them. Teachers who have been in the school system for a decade might not be considering leaving. 

Better pay= less turnover = more stability in the classroom = better quality education for students. 

But what do I know, I'm not a fucking rocket scientist.",1644538970.0

spky5n,Food for Thought: Self-organizing vs Self-governing,1,0.6,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spky5n/food_for_thought_selforganizing_vs_selfgoverning/,1,">In the case of a self-organizing system, the joint activity of components (e.g.  people) ‘generates a field’ that guides their behavior in a distributed manner not mediated by centralized processing. In the case of a self-governing system, information distributed throughout the components is being collected, processed, and stored in a context-independent format, allowing the system to be more flexible in its choice of means. The extra layer of collecting, processing, and storing information distinguishes a self-governing system from a self-organizing (Ismael 2011). Put simply, a self-governing system acts like an aware and informed actor reacting to external signals according to its experience, goals, beliefs, etc. In contrast, a self-organizing system reacts on occurring stimuli in a predetermined and predictable way.

>Denters (2012) claims that a community initiative is a mode of public governance based on principles of self-governance. Based on his definition, we define community self-governance as a collective activity initiated by either (1) a local government or citizens where citizens (2) actively participate in a project implementation and (3) have decision making power about its means and ends (4) for the common good. This simple but comprehensive definition contains actors (1), an overall goal (4), and a method for achieving it (2, 3). Generally, the common interest of citizens is improvement of the quality of life. Jacobs (1993) argues that quality of life is closely linked to the ability of a community to self-determine its conditions of everyday life. As was discussed earlier in the chapter, one of the dimensions of smart city development is the institutional dimension, which stresses citizen-driven 
government (Nam and Pardo 2011a). Therefore, possible self-governance models are particularly interesting in the context of smart city development.

>Citizen empowerment can be seen as a top-down approach to community self-governance. A government can empower citizens by designing appropriate policies that foster self-governance initiatives. The Dutch case of ‘social initiatives’ may serve as an example of an empowering role of a government (Kleinhans 2017). A 
bottom-up approach means that grassroots initiatives are launched by local communities, NGOs or activists. An example here are the grassroots actions by citizens in San Francisco towards a more pedestrian-friendly urban environment (Pagano 2013, more details in Sect. 4).

>A prosperous smart city can be built utilizing a top-down or-bottom-up approach but only with active involvement of various stakeholders. “United efforts create synergy, which allows individual projects to build upon each other for faster progress, resulting in the involved, informed and trained critical mass necessary for the transformation of how the entire community carries out its work” (Nam and Pardo 2011a, p. 287). Therefore, community self-governance projects should not necessarily be initiated by a community itself; a local administration can play facilitating or enabling role for citizen initiatives. In our view, self-governance is undeservedly neglected layer in smart cities and has central role in the smart city concept bridging together people, technologies, and policies.

 My boss texted us and said we are supposed to be there Monday. I emailed HR for clarification on whether or not maintenance has to report to work. They never got back to me. I didn't show up for work Monday since I assumed we weren't supposed to. This was the first day of the nation wide lockdown.

My boss called me Monday to ask where I was. The rest of the maintenance staff reported to work.  I wasn't coming in. I told my boss about the email we all received from HR, and  he told me that HR wasn't my boss...😆

He threatened to take 8 hours of personal time. Which he did. I finally called HR and explained to them the situation. They said maintenance was NOT to report and I was given my personal time back. 

I told HR I wasn't sure I could trust him to give me the right information anymore.

Fast forward to last week our facilities director emailed maintenance staff saying due to the snow we were not to report to work, that we would get paid. 

My boss called us Friday and said he wasn't sure if they would pay us for both days, and If we came Sunday for snow removal, he'd let us leave early.

I told him I was unavailable. He took 8 hours of my personal time. I emailed the facilities director and told him I was under the impression we would be paid for both days. He said I was right. I told him the staff who showed up Sunday should get OT. He agreed. 

The facilities director took the blame of not communicating more clearly to my boss. It is obvious to me my boss has undermined HR and the facilities director more than once. What I don't understand is why they're ok with it.",1644538465.0

My old boss was a complete tool - it was always if you don’t do this I’m taking this away, told me he was minimizing my access to make sure I wasn’t abusing it - without any follow up or additional explanations. He would message me asking why I was working on project A for so long via a screen shot and I would reply with a screen shot showing I had moved on to another project 15 minutes earlier, petty shit like that. 

So I have a disability (I won’t be elaborating) and I would ask my boss at times to shift the workload for me on days where I was struggling only to be told “well just work on what you can but if it gets busy I need you to step up” - at the time I did not realize that this was 100% against the law and I should have reported it. 

My new boss, I came to them with the same situation and was told “absolutely let me alter your work load for a couple days and you can go back to the regular work load when you are feeling better” 

So I am sitting here wondering - do I report this?

I quit my last job 2 and a half months ago and I wanted to take a break from working before starting to work again. Well, now I'm at the point where I kinda need to get a job in order to have enough income ready for college and I've already gotten a few interview offers that I want to accept but... I just can't.

The idea of being in a work environment again makes me insanely anxious. Every time I think about going back to work my stomach just sinks. I had a horrible, traumatic experience at my last job, which was also my first ever job. I was treated like complete shit by both management and coworkers just for being trans and autistic. I was denied the same opportunities as my coworkers because they ""didn't trust me"" despite not even seeing me work in those positions and constantly confined to the same spaces that people who had just started working there were assigned to even when I had been there for more than 6 months. In addition to that, I was literally bullied by multiple people, including a manager. For the first few months I was at that job almost everybody talked shit about me behind my back and spread rumors about me due to me being trans. I was constantly misgendered. One of my coworkers even fucking quit as soon as I got hired just because she didn't want to work alongside me due to me being trans. This continued for 4 months up until I finally reported one of my coworkers and she ended up fired. 

It was just extremely horrible all around. I'm grateful for the few friends I made there but the experience literally fucking traumatized me. I can't even think about going back there, even just to watch a movie, without feeling sick. Right after I quit I didn't feel this way but I've fully processed all of the traumatic things that happened while I was there and it's just completely ruined my attitude towards working. I don't understand why this kind of behavior is allowed, especially in a supposedly ""professional"" environment and ESPECIALLY towards someone who was a minor at the time. 

And that's bled over into my attitude towards work as a whole now. I don't want to start at a new job only to have the same exact experience with my coworkers and managers again.

spkh1z,Hot Take: Maybe we shouldn't be making more cogs for the corporate regime,19,0.77,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spkh1z/hot_take_maybe_we_shouldnt_be_making_more_cogs/,26,"I don't believe we should be having kids in this economic environment. Hear me out.   


You're probably pretty pissed that your parents didn't have shit to offer and now you are stuck in an endless cycle of wage slavery barely getting by for 50+ years. I'd be there, too, if I hadn't ""married up"" to a higher caste.

  
So my logic here is that having children of your own to suffer in poverty with you is inflicting the same generational poverty and hellish existence on yet another generation simply because ""you wanted"" them, despite being unable to give them a decent life.  Even though It isn't your fault you can't provide them with a decent start in life, but seeing as most of us cannot, and are aware that our lives are generally pretty miserable, why do so many people still do it?  Is it not the definition of selfishness?

  
Is it not more prudent to forgo having children then?  Why create more cogs for the capitalist machine?  We can vote all we want but we see how well that's worked for us.  We've worked hard, and that hasn't worked for us.  The hot take is that *we can only ""fix"" things by non-action*.  Don't buy stupid pointless shit, (especially from Amazon,)  collectively on a monthly basis why not we pick a brand or product to not buy any of as to hurt those industries en masse, we can organize call-out protests where we simply don't show up for 10 days straight and watch them squirm.  (Apparently the government has told on themselves and 10 days is just too much to miss work, even if harboring a deadly virus.  (Thanks Covid.)    


And we can choose to not make more cogs for the capitalist machine as long as it takes until things improve.  


The system as we know it isn't changing anytime soon. It's 2022 and the minimum wage is still $7.25.  
Most of us don't have health insurance or have shitty insurance. Is is not selfish to bring children into a capitalist hellscape to suffer similarly as you, and how can you or anyone else justify it aside from a shallow assumption their life will just magically be better and hoping that they'll just escape the rat race on their own without you being able to provide the tools in which to assure some class mobility?

  
Is anyone's selfish desire to fall into the status quo and have a family worth bringing another innocent into the world to suffer for 80 years the way most of us do? Is there any good or selfless reason to have kids in this dumpster fire? Is there any reason that doesn't start with ""I wanted...?""",1644537428.0

I currently work as a trading assistant (shelf stacker) in the UK for a very large supermarket business. Btw I have absolutely loved working here, the pay is great and the management know what they’re doing (well, at least compared to my old job as a waiter). I’ve been kept on for a few months after being a Christmas Temp, I’ve got one more month here and if I do well enough, I’ll be able to stay on permanently.
Today I was working a 5-9 which I love. However, this shift was going really weird, time just didn’t seem to make sense at all for me this shift and I truly didn’t feel right. I didn’t get much sleep at all last night either so that doesn’t help. About (what I thought was) halfway through my shift, I checked the time on my phone. I’m pretty damn sure I was 2 hours in. I move onto the next task (top stock on 2 aisles and empty this cage onto the shelves) where I got told that I was being extremely slow, apparently 45 minutes had passed since I asked what to do next and I wasn’t even 25% of the way through the 2 aisles. I decided to really pick my pace up and I thought I’ve been working really hard this shift, I was super proud.
I checked my phone and I had 4 minutes left of my shift, so I emptied the cardboard and clicked out on time.
My manager then stops me by the entrance and questions what time I got on and off. I say ‘5-9’ and he double checks the time with me. It’s just gone 8pm. I say how sorry I am and that I’ll get right back on shift and that it’s completely my fault, when he asks me if I’m alright. I say that I really didn’t sleep too well last night and he just tells me to go home and that we’ll speak about it next shift (Saturday). I seriously don’t even remotely understand how the hell this happened. I could’ve sworn I double checked to make sure the time was right and it was.
I’m super worried because this job is pretty damn important to me and I don’t know what’s gonna happen. I know I’ve screwed up for sure so I’ll obviously own up to it completely and apologise, making sure I definitely get that extra hour done next week. If someone could help me out on what to do and how I should be feeling about this, I’d really appreciate it :)",1644535921.0

We even put artificial turf down in all the aisles. It was used and we got it free from some local high school that replaced their field. It looks awful and those little black pieces of rubber are now everywhere.

Long story short- 

I’ve worked here for 9 months. In my role for about 4 now. I spent the entire time so far fixing mistakes from the last person, but my job is for 2 people- in one. Every day I get more and more behind because I can’t keep up, and anytime I mention this to him, he makes it about my lack of work ethic. I’m working overtime currently and not being paid. He also punishes me for that too. If I try to stay late after work or work on the weekend (unpaid I might add) he says that is a lack of my time management. But the last 3 people who did my job quit due to stress.

At this point he no longer speaks to me, no longer asks about my day, we have no cordial conversations except when he’s belittling me. (He mocks me sometimes if I ask a question he thinks is stupid) or he constantly will come at me with how what I’ve done has effected other peoples jobs- though he gave me a job I wasn’t qualified for and is now blaming me because I couldn’t hack it. He’s completely used me as a scapegoat to the point where my colleagues won’t even email me anymore they go through him because they think I’m incompetent and he will then email me to get it done. It’s at the point now where he is using me as an example of “what not to do” to the new staff right infront of me. 

I feel so helpless and worthless. I work the hardest out of my team and I work extra hours to keep up and he actually gets angry at me for it. So you understand- in 3 days I received over 500 emails. and these are not things I can just answer right away. It’s things I need to do work and contact people to find information for. It can take almost an hour or more per inquiry. this is my day to day. 

That’s not even the extent of it. HR had to get involved because of bullying against me in the office, and he wouldn’t stick up for me though they admitted to doing it. I’m honestly so exhausted my health is taking a toll. I barely eat, I don’t enjoy my time off, I can’t shower or brush my teeth most days, I feel like a shell of a human being. But I’ve been applying for months and not even a bite. I could walk away and get just a minimum wage job, but then I’d be out about 25k a year that I’m making now above that…… I feel like I’ve been squeezed into a place I can’t run from. I brought this all up to HR but they just quit so now I’m afraid to approach the new one as I don’t know how they will handle it. 


At this point I’m just waiting to be fired. If you’ve read this far- thanks

My uncle was like the father in the TV Show Succession, in fact I’ve had to pause that show many times cause it remembers me too much of him. 

OK, when he was 70 he told his oldest son he was retiring and wanted him to become President of the firm. The guy started to take steps for the transition and his dad DIDN’T like it! So my uncle decided to not retire and fired his son and all his team. We were still in high school but were brought in through Internship arrangements to help. 

At some point my uncle installed cameras to monitor employees activity. He fired an employee because she did some extreme kissing in an office (a video he watched like 20 times). He would sit in front of the cameras at 5 pm and say “Look at them, the clock strikes 5 pm and they run like rats.” Bro its their hour to leave! 

Years down the road he was harassing one of the female employees  And I told him to stop doing it that he could be sued. He decided to call all our family and say he was worried I didn’t know how to be a man.

Took me a long time to find a career path that i actually liked ( due to various reasons) and I applied to a Digital marketing agency when I was 28.

Low position, minimum wage (around 700€) but i wanted to learn, since i was very interested. Due to my upbringing and personal issues, I also struggled with saying 'no' to any request, along with me being an overachiever.

The whole vibe in the company was ""we are a family, loyalty for ever, dedication will be rewarded""....

. 

Boss was a serial  entrepreneur and he basically kept on loading more and more work on me, I accepted without complaint. From one project to another, i kept on working and performing, basically never a thank you from his side, just verbal abuse if stuff didn't go his way. I basically had to beg to get a moment monthly salary bump of 70€,.


Boss is bipolar and goes from ""okay' to 'i will fucking fire all of you""  within 3 minutes...every week.

Move forward 2 years

Agency going well, i created a great team of 15+ ppl to handle various tasks. Boss decided to move into a new and very competitive industry. I'm still tasked to oversee the 'old"" team. After all, I will be rewarded for my efforts at some point 

I'm plagued with migraines and stomach issues every week. 

Within 2 weeks from the initial idea, we started working on a new platform. I basically did the extra work of 3-4 people, doing most of the research, connect writing and SEO for 8+ languages ( companies usually have at least 1 person to handle one language). 

Anyway, kept on working 10-12 hour days, because ""we will all be rich, rewarded for our loyalty"". I'm still barely above minimum wage, boss and his bestie COO keep on raking in the big bucks.

People in my position would earn around 2k€ or more easily...

Migraines, stomach issues basically every day, working on painkillers. Different doctors can't find anything wrong with me physically.

After setting up 2 specialized departments for this second project, managing 30+ people, working my ass of, he still tells me in not doing enough, i should push harder, give me more work to do. Every mistake is on me, every achievement is his doing. But okay, soon he will share the wealth with all of us, for our dedication.

One Friday i can't handle the pain ( very bad migraine), i leave work early, thinking I'll be working on Saturday, as usual .

I couldn't.

Barely had the energy to move from bed do fridge. 

Monday comes, same. Couldn't get up, i call in sick, felt horrible for missing work. Doctor writes me a note .

After a week, no change.

After a month, boss calls me ( nobody else of the ""family' from the office), to ask when I'll be back, work is piling up 
Tell him that i don't know .

Another month, still can barely move out of bed. Doctors diagnoze, complete mental and physical burnout. 

Third month, I tell the boss to fire me, since i don't know when I'll be back. He starts complicating about 'paying me extra for my unused vacation days""... Tells me how he did me a solid by paying me an additional 500€. 

I get some papers to sign, that's it. No word from anybody else, at all.

I'm resting for 6 months, burning through my savings, before I can even thing of going to work again. I start going to psychotherapy to fix my shit - best decision ever.

I find out, that ex-boss hired 4 people to cover for my work, they were not enough. 

I got a job with basically 3x pay, my own hours and with work from home without 1 week of looking. 


More than 1 year after I'm out of the company, he contracts me on Instagram, out of all the channels. 

Some BS about 'how are you?"" And 'Do you blame me for how you ended up? Idk.. sometimes i feel like you blame me. Maybe. Not sure what to think. I was super correct with you...""

Wtf? The guy is so far to guys own ass, he wouldn't see a fire even if he was standing in the middle of it. 


The project we've set up is doing great btw, by now it's a multi-million international company, bring very well known in most of EU. Ofc I got jack shit off the profits, apart from a fucked up stomach.

TLDR - boss pushed me to my physical and mental limits for more than 3 years, and then he asks if it's somehow his fault

Like the title says, after 6+ years of service, I just got riffed, laid off, let go, had my position eliminated.  Thought I handled enough critical systems for some job security, but guess not.  I'm not the only one, this was a major layoff for my former employer and a continuation of what's been happening over the last few years.

My friend works in a really strict, uptight, by-the-book corporation. They are a couple of people in the team, not more than 7-8 in total. They each have their responsibilities, but at the end of the day, they collaborate together to achieve a joint goal. Their work also depends on one another, so if someone is missing today, one of the people that are at work, needs to do the missing member's work as well.  
So, rolling back the story to a few months ago, my friend tells me, that this Tam person (name is made-up, for easier referencing throughout this post), each second week or so, or at least 2-3 times in the month, Tam would go missing. Either Tam is sick, or Tam is away unannounced, he caught corona a record-braking 4 times so far, and so-on, using all the existent and non-existent excuses in the book, to avoid doing work. Also, my friends team, all of them work from home during the pandemic, and usually, once every month or so, they go to the office to meet each other and complete some important piece of work. Tam naturally, would always have some excuse to not show up.  
Another thing is that Tam also has some close family in another country, so each Friday afternoon, and Monday morning (the exact times of some cheap flights), he comes down with a sore throat or similar...  
This has been going on for a while, about 1.5 years to be exact. Which brings me to the latest story that my friend told me recently. Apparently, Tam pulled-off a mega-move, ghosting his employer and the team. So how it happened, roughly, is that one day, Tam just stopped coming to work. For the first 1-2 days, people assumed it was business as usual, Tam is sick again, whatever, people are used to it... Then 3-4 days have passed, and Tam's superior, the leader of the team, tries to contact Tam. No response. Then a few days later, the leader of the team calls the emergency contact for Tam, no response. Basically, it has been \~2-3 weeks now, and nobody has heard a thing from Tam.  
My friend has Tam on whatsapp, and notices that the number does not exist anymore, and Tam has probably cancelled the subscription for that number for a while... Also, this comes in the perhaps the most busiest time for the business domain that my friend is working in...  
My friend suspects that Tam has had a look at employment law, as he stopped showing up, on exactly the same day that the pay calculation starts, so he got 100% of the previous period's pay. Also, employment law says if you don't show up for N weeks, your contract is terminated, so he is now gone off the books as well...  
My question is, is this normal nowadays...? Is this something people do?!",1644531659.0

Firstly, I just want to say this job is a ""face to face marketing agency"" what this means is that I, as well as others, will have to go to customers and clients houses, business meetings and events/conventions to try and gain clients for a company that have hired us to promote them. Basically what this means is that I'll be having to knock on people's doors and talk to them about a charity, Internet provider etc whatever company hired us. We will be having ID and things to prove we are legit but I'm not sure if thats who I wish to become.

Secondly, if I do wish to leave, I can leave right away. But I'll have to pay my dad back X amount for work clothes and other bits. This means I'll have to work for atleast 4 to 6 weeks to get my first paycheck to pay him back. 

I personally really don't know if I can just go round knocking on doors asking people to fund this and that. I love talking to people and being well paid for my age. However I really can't grasp the fact that all I'll be doing is disturbing people to ask them for money. And that's why I'm asking for some advice on what my next moves should be.

Seriously how can these companies expect to attract talent away from the remote jobs when there are so many cons. The only reason I considered it was the pay but fuck that. I rather stay at my current job that doesn’t insult me or expect us to work weekends and the best part, it is remote.

He straight up told me what he was offering salary wise and it was right around my asking price. No bs, no back and forth, no having to convince myself to take a lower offer because it is closer to where I live.

Here is the best part. They are giving the person I am replacing two weeks notice. They are allowed to interview during working hours no questions asked. They don't have to stay the full two weeks, but they are getting paid regardless in addition to severance.

I failed to consider the managers might be awful.

The first red flag was, after working there part time for a week, any questions I dared to ask about procedures were met with laughter (even in front of customers).

Friday dinner is our busiest time of the week, a few DAYS into working there it was just me and my manager. I started getting busy so I went to the office to find her scrolling through tiktok and asked her to come help. Ten minutes later she came out to a queue of customers and delivery drivers waiting for orders and the first thing she said was ‘so you’ve not cleaned the fridge I asked you to then?’. Well no I haven’t, I’ve been busy serving and cooking food for your customers on my own?? At the end of that night she left her laptop emails open on the counter and I could very clearly see one from the owner (her mum) criticising ‘the new boy’ for being lazy and not caring. Went home considering quitting there and then.

Finally, today I went to get food on my break. 3 hours in to a 12 hour shift. I had what would be considered a child’s meal on our menu, but as soon as I sat down I got a message from the owner (she lives in Greece so she’d obviously been watching the CCTV) telling me I’d gotten too much and suggesting this was the reason the business was losing money.

It’s dumb, because I know the schedule wasn’t written yet.

I’m cool with working any other holiday. But V-Day? I hate this stupid “holiday”. It’s just commercialism for corporations to profit drain people.

If you’re in a relationship, you should love and take care of your partner EVERYDAY, not just one day of the calendar year.

Even Christmas is commercialized, but it at least has an important meaning behind it (both from a religious POV and not religious).

It’s bad enough having to see couples in a relationship on a daily basis, it hurts me. But an entire day ALL ABOUT IT???

At Kroger, they make everything a big deal. All it is for the corporation is about money, just like everything else. They want me there to help because it’s busy, guess what? I care more about myself than that, even though I hate myself and don’t really care about myself.

I don’t want to be around other people on that day, I want to lock myself in my room and be by myself. 

They’ll probably want me to go help in that tent, to make things even worse. Weirdly it didn’t bother me the last few years (that I can remember) but I guess I was just still more hopeful that there was hope for me to have a loving girlfriend, and more hopeful about life in general.

I already told supervisor I have a doctor appointment on that day (I don’t). They said since the schedule is already written, I’d have to switch shifts with someone. The people I asked today already work on V-Day.

If I call in sick, they’ll know I’m faking now. If I stick to the “doctors appointment”, and insist I can’t go in, they might try to make me either come in for a few hours later, or provide a doctor note.

I hate that my life has even come to this point, I’m too old for this (job and life circumstances ending me up here) but exposing myself to all the people who can actually get into relationships won’t be some “exposure therapy” for me, it’ll only put me in a 1000x worse mindset and mood.

I really don’t even care if I get written up, I’ve never been written up and you get 3 before termination, right? I kind of want to be fired, but I just don’t know what I’d do next, so I’d really rather not get fired.

Like, if I call in or insist I CANNOT miss my doctor appointment, and I don’t provide a doctor note (unless my doctor can write one even though I’m not actually seeing them at this time) what’s the worst that’ll happen to me?

I’m trying to keep the concept of “romantic and sexual” relationships out of my mind, I’m trying to suppress my desire for that from any women, because I’m ugly and work at Kroger (bagging and pushing carts, even worse).

I seriously might have some kind of outburst or meltdown, it’s just too much to keep bottled up.

I don’t really care about this job that much, it’s dead end, for years on end they’ll keep you at the bottom, and there is really no level that is really great. I’d rather be dead anyway, I feel if I quit or get fired I might have to seriously be ready to end my life, because I can’t seem to do better and I can’t deal with the consequences, whether my situation is my fault or not.

I’m not just an employee, I’m an effing human being, even though I don’t really feel like one.",1644527700.0

Due to the nature of my business we can't fully transition to a worker co-op, but we do full profit sharing and unlimited PTO (just started that this year).

I work 7 days a week, even when I get a day off I can't be more than ten minutes away from the shop in case someone gets sick or an emergency pops up.  I've had to cut appointments short, cancel plans, and just give up on having ANY life outside of work.  We can't afford to close the doors, we can't afford to lose any momentum in growth or we're going to drop off and fail.  And if we fail, that's a bunch of people that lose a job that provides a living wage, and a real chance for them to have a future.

Plenty of posts here oversimplify this: If I can't afford to run a successful business, I have no rights to be running one.  But, how many of the people posting those have run businesses?  Let alone profitable ones that have survived for nearly a decade, providing *living wages* *to all employees*.  We're not printing money, and we aren't the only fish in the pond competing for limited resources.  It honestly doesn't mean any difference at all to my customers that my staff is taken care of.  *Literally* no one gives a shit, so we can only stay afloat by our own merits.  We're god damned great at our jobs (my staff are fucking amazing, and, they don't burn out, but, I definitely am nothing but smoldering ash).

We're small, and in an industry where bigger chains are just starting to devour the market.  We can't compete with their pricing, they can buy in orders of magnitude more volume, and suppress their worker's pay to minimum wage.  And there's no winning against them.  As a consumer, price and convenience are the single greatest determining factors in picking which shop someone goes to.  We can offer superb customer service, full maintenance and warranties, and even give out freebies/loaners/etc... to help people when they're short.  But, none of that really matters, it only barely keeps us floating when the shop down the street sells for 5% less.

They don't give a shit that they have to rotate through staff constantly.  They don't train their staff to answer questions about products or troubleshoot problems.  Hell, the staff there are so fucking drained and disillusioned that I've never seen them happy, and that almost seems like a selling point to some of the sadistic fucking customers out there.  Some huge fucking number of you (all people, not just specifically antiwork), are fucking abominable humans that take sick satisfaction in seeing we servile plebs miserable in our tasks.

And that seems to be the end goal.  Drive every smaller business out, eliminate every single entry level job that pays a living wage, and keep the working class as enslaved consumers that can only subsist by purchasing at the very companies that drove them into poverty.  Whether you're going to admit/accept it doesn't fucking matter, you are in a class war, and not picking a side is the complacency that your oppressors have engineered and are counting on.

If you really want better workplaces, start campaigning for real fucking change, or start making noise and protesting.  Monopolies are being encouraged, and they are immensely destructive to the average quality of life, fucking do something or watch the world get incrementally worse while you work yourself to death.

Or, fucking tear it down.  Organize in numbers like the fuckwit truckers in Ottawa, and make the simple but effective ultimatum.  Change through reform, or revolution.

Bottom line, stop fucking expecting the world to change, stop thinking that the small business owner that's clearing about the same as you per year, with the entirety of their life's work as collateral, is your enemy in a system that's oppressing both of you.  End capitalism, or, at least end monopolies if you're a fan of half-measures.",1644527202.0
sph1nu,I quit my job yesterday. Like walked out in the middle of the day quit.,28,0.83,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sph1nu/i_quit_my_job_yesterday_like_walked_out_in_the/,30,"Buckle up, peeps. It's a long one.

I've (29) been working as a dental hygienist in the state of Connecticut for 6 months now. I am not new to hygiene but I am new to the area. I have never worked in a dental office like this ever in my life. 

It started out ok. Everyone was nice enough. Some people had attitude problems but didn't seem personal so whatever. About a month after I started the other hygienist (in her 60s) there called the dentist and told her that I was saying all kinds of nasty things about her. Mentioning how I didn't like the office, how I didn't like working with the dentist, etc. She would twist a lot of what I was saying into something completely untrue. The doctor confronted me about this and I was honest saying I don't know why she would say all of that. I asked her about it and she first denied it and said that the dentist must have misheard her or that maybe I was too emotional?? Idk. She eventually admitted she lied and called because I had asked for new equipment that was broken because I needed it to work, one of which is a chair that I sit on while I work with patients. The chair would sink to the floor and I couldn't get a proper ergonomic seating position on it. Other hygienist, that we will call Karen since she acts like one, was pissy because they ordered me a new chair. The chair she sits on is over $1000 and was given to her for free by the other dentist who recently retired. I was getting a crummy chair, standard chair and she got all jealous about it?? Mind boggling. The dentist told me that I was not the first person that Karen had done this to, not even then second one, and that people have left the practice because of her. Dentist assured me that she believed me and not to worry about it. That was only the start of a very long and toxic work environment. 

I have endured quite a bit from almost every employee so I will list them each. 

The assistant (37? ish):

•She constantly yelled at me about sterilization and cleaning instruments. I would often miss half of my lunch because I would be cleaning up after everyone since they left for lunch already. No matter how much I did, no matter how well I did things, it was never enough for the assistant. After the whole thing happened with Karen, the office Manager (OM) moved me to a different room, one farther away from Karen. It was set up as a dental room so I needed to move things around and convert it into a hygiene room. I got the direct ok from OM to do this. I see the assistant complaining about the sterilization area not being taken care of by me and hear OM say that I was told to focus on something else. Assistant comes up to me while I have a patient in my chair and screams about how I'm not pulling my weight and yada yada. My patient can hear everything. It's embarrassing. Best part is they're all her instruments! It's not like I'm leaving mine behind or something, that I'd understand but this is because I'm not acting as their personal Cinderella at all times. I don't mind doing everyone's instruments, it's what is expected at an office, we help each other out. But this place was unbelievable. •She would leave passive aggressive sticky notes everywhere calling others lazy for nothing doing things a certain way. •She screamed at me for not setting up her dental trays. I have never set up dental trays as I have never been an assistant. No one has ever asked me to do this. At 7:50am, as soon as I get into the office, she screams at me and asks me why I don't do this. I let her know that I didn't know I was supposed to and that no one has shown me how. She walks away yelling about how it's not her job to show me how to do things? •She came into my room when I was with a patient to complain about me using a specific x-ray sensor. I put it back where I found it and she said I was not to use that one as it was HER sensor even though it's for office use. •I let her know that we weren't following the manual's instructions on how to properly sterilize the instruments, something I brought up before but received push back on. She was screaming at me about how she's been doing this for four years. She doesn't care what the manual says, she will continue to do it the way she's been doing it. 

Dentist (37):

•She would embarrass me in front of patients. I had one patient in my chair who said how much he enjoyed working with me and how thorough I was. When she did her exam she said out loud and in front of the patient that I had left a lot of tartar and to go back and get it. I don't even remember if there actually was any tartar there but I remember wondering why she said that. •She constantly would go against my suggestions for patients with periodontal disease saying they don't have bone loss or bleeding even though they definitely did and I would take intraoral pictures for notes to back up my argument. She once had me sit and show her how I measure the gum tissue, in front of the patient, after disagreeing with my treatment even though I still wholeheartedly believe he needed a deep cleaning. •She spent 30 extra minutes doing an exam on a patient, telling them they don't need deep cleaning, etc, and went into the next patient's appointment time. The patient left because of the wait and she came back and screamed at me for taking too long and how she could not believe I made him leave by taking so long. •She would go to Karen's room to do her exams and then not do mine. I often would wait over 30 minutes or more while waiting for an exam, making me run behind for my next patients. •I scheduled to get in house dental whitening. It was $312, no discount for us and that was fine for me. They applied the product 4 times for 15 minutes each. About an hour after treatment I was in such horrible pain. The worst pain I've ever experienced. Nothing would help at all, no pain killers even took the edge off. I called in the next morning because I was in so much pain. Dentist told me she never gets complaints about the pain and she's never heard anything like it. I notice after a day or two the whitening is already going back to my original color so I look up Opalescence online and it specifically says that they do 2 twenty minute treatments and sometimes 3 but they don't encourage 3 because it will cause sensitivity. I call up the whitening company and let them know what's happened. The representative says that the whitening didn't last because it wasn't applied properly. She also let me know that they should have given me whitening trays to go home with to continue the treatment as the initial in office whitening is meant to ""open up the teeth"" so to speak and take in continued whitening at home. I talk to the dentist about this and she says this is how they taught her in school. I ask her if she is maybe confusing it for another in office whitening called Zoom which does do 4 treatments of 15 mins. She changes her story and says how she started doing it this way because patients were complaining of pain when they did it the 20 mins way. When I talked to her a few days ago she said she had never heard of anyone getting sensitivity and pain but now it was so common she had to change how they did it? Her story then becomes how she also experiences pain when she does the whitening this ""new way"". 

The front desk (60s?):

•Scolded me about not following procedures in front of the patient I just worked on even though I absolutely DID follow the proper procedure. •Told one of my patients she had to charge him for something else even though I did not do that treatment. His insurance didn't cover it and he never came back. •I had a 19 year old who requested the use of nitrous oxide for her cleaning. I was told we were out of nitrous so as she was checking in, I let her know that we did not have nitrous and asked her if she wanted to do an exam and x-rays today and to come back for nitrous when we restocked it. She agreed but she started to cry and asked if she could step back and call her mom. I said, of course, and went to set everything up. When I came back to receive her, front desk is yelling at me (in front of the waiting room) about how cruel I am and that my patient is crying in the waiting room and I need to comfort her. I let her know that I already comforted her and she asked for a moment to call her mom. I bring the patient back, we get along great! She gets her cleaning done without nitrous and is so happy since she's not gotten a cleaning without nitrous in over 10 years. She says she wants to see only me when she comes back. Before front desk leaves I let her know that I know she comes from a good place and that I appreciate her but she can come off as patronizing. She proceeds to tell me that she doesn't care, I didn't handle the situation properly and that she will never change. Ever since then she literally did not say a single word to me. This was several weeks ago. 

Office Manager (50s?): 

•Wrote ""What somebody thinks about you is none of your business"" on our break room white board for some reason. •Whenever I would approach her for guidance regarding the constant harassment from the other employees she would make excuses for them and somehow turn it around on me. When I tried to discuss with her about front desk she said she agreed with front desk and that I did not handle the situation properly. I reminded her that the patient was very happy with how everything turned out and I didn't want to bring her to the back with all of the sharp instruments everywhere as I felt that would have been overwhelming to be around if she had dental anxiety. Her only response to that was ""she didn't seem that happy when she came up to check out"". That's because she had a cavity.... but I digress. She also used this as an opportunity to tell me that I was no longer allowed to get up to let the dentist know I was ready for an exam and that I had to wait for her instead.l because it is ""unprofessional"".... •I let her know that our medical history charts in the system are almost always incomplete. I alerted her to a specific instance where Karen wrote down the the patient had a knee replacement and was unsure if she needed to take an antibiotic before cleaning in her notes but it was not in the chart. I had to go searching for it which is not something we should have to do. It was also incorrect, she had both of her hips replaced and she DID need an antibiotic before treatment. OM came back at me about how it's the patients' fault that their health history is not correct. No idea what her mental gymnastics was to get to that conclusion, but ok. •The dentist called out for possible COVID-19 and OM and front desk made me lie to patients saying dentist was out due to a family emergency. •I caught covid from the dentist and my area was completely out of tests. I had a fever of 103.2 for almost 5 days. Every single day I was harassed by OM about how I didn't know it was covid bc I didn't have a test and asking me if I could go into the office. I had a panic attack outside of an urgent care because they would not see me and she kept encouraging me to go back in and argue with them, call them, etc. •When I went to discuss with her about the dental whitening I received, she made me feel stupid. Even after I showed her the website where it specifically says how to apply it. I still haven't gotten any apologies or reimbursement for that.

Karen:

•Started the rumor mill about me. •Kept asking me if I fucked my boyfriend on his birthday. She asked me if I ""gave him a birthday delight"" and I awkwardly laughed and walked away. She came up to me again and asked ""so? Did you give him a little treat??"" I told her it isn't much of a treat if he already ""gets it"" every other morning. I was so uncomfortable with that question but felt that if I didn't answer she wouldn't drop it. •Would constantly bother me about how I got up to let the dentist know I was ready for an exam. •Would constantly hear her and the assistant trash talking me. Saying they couldn't wait for me to leave, they're not going to help me with instruments etc. •Went into the waiting room and told a patient that was in my schedule to request her next time. Patient expressed to me that she wanted to see me again but felt pressured into seeing Karen for her next visit because of her going up to her. When I brought this up to OM, she said ""I've never seen Karen do that"". •I prefer my instruments to be bagged in the larger pouch because I noticed they puncture less. I don't share my instruments with Karen so shouldn't be a big deal but for some reason it is and becomes a thing with her.

And all this brings us to yesterday. Yesterday I was doing my instruments and noticed Karen put her polishing hand piece in the ultrasonic bath. I know you probably don't know what that means but they shouldn't go in there as it will damage them. Went over to her and said ""hey don't forget that these don't go in there"" and she literally came at me. Very aggressive, screaming at me, throwing her hands in my face etc. I said ""ok sorry just drop it"" and she literally followed me around the office screaming and putting her hands in my face. I went up to the front to talk to OM and said hey can I talk to you she says ""can it wait?"" And I say ""no it absolutely cannot"" and she gave me attitude. So I said in front of everyone including patients. ""after this next patient, I'm going home. I quit"". I go back to my op to set up for next pt, OM comes back to try and talk to me. I'm wiping and cleaning, om is in the doorway and the Karen is behind her screaming and throwing her hands around. OM keeps trying to talk to me while Karen is screaming. She leaves and comes back to scream again. Finally OM gets her to go away and she makes excuses for her!! She talks about how they've been cleaning them for years like this etc. Why does it matter. I show her the damage it is doing to the polishers and I remind her that we had to replace 2 of them after only a short time of use. OM goes on to tell me that I'm not friendly because I don't say good morning every time I am in. It was just bullshit. Finally I told her this is why I don't talk to her and to leave me alone. I finish the patient, I clean up. Finish my notes, and I leave.

I was supposed to have a meeting with the regional manager about the issues in the office and the doctor under diagnosing periodontal disease at noon but I couldn't even make it 10am. I ended up talking to him anyway but even that is a whole nother story in itself. 

tl;dr constantly harassed at work by nearly every employee. HR did nothing to help even though I have been consistently vocal about these issues. Quit after coworker was screaming and throwing her hands in my face.",1644527078.0

The minimum wage is being raised by $1.20 an hour to $21.20 from the start of April, Workplace Relations and Safety Minister Michael Wood announced today.

Amid rising complaints from businesses that they will have less than two months to prepare for the increase, the Government announced the changes this morning.

""Many Kiwis who earn the minimum wage have gone above and beyond in our fight against COVID-19. We remain committed to supporting New Zealanders by raising their wages, as we continue to recover and rebuild from the pandemic,"" Wood said in a statement.

""Raising the minimum wage will directly benefit approximately 300,000 workers, and will help many households that have been most impacted by the effects of COVID.

The starting-out and training minimum wage will also increase from $16 to $16.96 per hour from 1 April 2022, Wood said.

Council of Trade Unions (CTU) president Richard Wagstaff welcomed the news.

""**The CTU believes that increases in the Minimum Wage are both essential and desirable. Unemployment is at record low levels**. Employers primary concern in surveys is their inability to access labour. **There has never been a better time to increase the minimum wage**. Despite suggestions to the contrary, international and New Zealand evidence suggests that increasing the minimum wage does not increase unemployment.""",1644526533.0

It’s always disheartening to see working class people simping for abuse. 

I also noticed that where I work (union shop), we’ve been getting letters in the mail from the “freedom foundation” urging us to drop the union. I’m wondering if other union members are also getting those and maybe it’s all related (freedom foundation type actively trying to urge people to drop their unions while sending trolls to places like this or maybe I’m just paranoid).

If you're not familiar with environmental or engineering consulting, we are required to hit what are called utilization goals. These goals are the percent of your 40+ hour work week are ""billed"" so a Client's project. My, and most of environmental or engineering consultants, have to hit 90% utilization, depending on the Company. I know of others that do not have 90%. 

So basically it means that our employers only pay for our salaries 10% of the time. This is usually charged as Admin. If you get sick, have to do some training, have to fill out safety sheets, etc. all of that goes to Admin time. If you go below 90% you get fired. 

 To me, this is inherent exploitation because our employers don't even really pay us. We have to depend on other companies to give us work, or we are fired. I know some of you on here will begin to explain that this is because we sell our labor and not a product, as if I didn't already know this.

Told me through an email.,12,0.88,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spg3pa/update_boss_cut_my_base_pay_in_half_told_me/,2,"[You can read the original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sbcmr8/boss_cut_my_base_pay_in_half_told_me_through_an/)

First off, many thanks to all who commented, gave me encouragement, and schooled me in the term constructive termination. I wrote my boss an email later that day and quit. She was not surprised, and was not planning on rehiring for my position. Knowing that I had a bit of a landing pad through unemployment was really huge. I had been thinking of changing career fields for a while now, and it encouraged me to apply to a couple of graduate programs doing something that I think is positive for the world and people, versus what I was doing, which was wringing money from local businesses to line my boss's pocket.

There were many questions about base pay vs commission. For anyone who's worked in sales, the base pay is usually a fraction of what you normally make overall. This is what I was expecting when I was recruited last year to do this job. In reality, the boss lady kept cancelling magazine issues (I sold advertising) after I had sold into them, which lost me money and clients. The base pay was just enough to cover my kids' childcare and allow me to break even. The commission would have been what I made on top of that. So, after the email that she sent me that cut my base pay in half (and said she would cut that in half again the month after), I was also seeing emails about her cancelling more issues. This was a poor business plan on her behalf; her competitor across town (and ex-business partner) was doing the opposite and increasing distribution and continuing to publish. Ex-partner was KILLING IT and taking all our business, while my boss was freaking out. In a company of 8 people, 5 (including me) had quit in the past 8 months.

 When I took this job, I signed my kids up for childcare, which meant a 10% nonrefundable deposit and a contract through the end of this June. So, within one month, I knew that not only would I be making substantially less, I also would no longer be making enough to even cover childcare, let alone my bills. I couldn't get out of the contract, so I really felt like my boss had screwed me over pretty hard.

Unemployment will be substantially less than what I make, but will still cover childcare while I change gears and get out of the cycle of work/spend and make a living doing something that's actually net beneficial for our society and environment.",1644524578.0

Just finished the first trimester and have needed some time off from work to go to doctors appointments and ultrasounds. I was originally pregnant with twins and one isn’t going to make it. Needless to say it’s been tough on me and hard to process. Right after I got that news, me and my 1 1/2 yo got diagnosed with Covid. We were so so sick and since I WFH my manager expected me to just work through… until I specifically asked if there was someone I could talk to about taking time off to get better for me and my kid. They gave me 5 days and on the third I was threatened with losing my job because I didn’t say “ I’m still sick “ every morning to my manager. That was a couple weeks ago. Fast forward to yesterday. I requested half the day off to attend another doctor appointment for my pregnancy. Things went BAD, surviving twin is trying to send nutrients to non-surviving twin and now I have to go see specialists. Of course my manager has been getting on me about missing days of work/sales goals and how it counts against me blah blah blah. So even though I’m distraught I sign into work to sell fucking life insurance while I’m dealing with losing one child and possibly the other. By the grace of god my internet went out, preventing me from doing my job. I get a message from manager, this is a no call no show now and more points added on and blah blah fucking blah. This company only allows medical time taken off if you’ve been with them over a year which I haven’t. They’re not offering maternity leave and they give me an issue anytime I need time off even though I’ve shared more than I’m comfortable with about my situation. 

I say all this shit to say. There should be more leniency for medical situations and things that are out of our control as parents. Of course, we have a job to do.

I think at that point, even they knew how ridiculous it was getting. And my boss at the job I was trying to leave thought there was something seriously wrong with my health, given the seven ""doctor's appointments"" I had to leave the office for (pre-pandemic) in the span of two months.

I think it would benefit the general narrative if you, people from countries other than US, could share your perspectives, your grievances and your problems that led you to becoming curious in the antiwork movement.

Guess I'll start?

I'm a young (gen Z) office worker from CIS country where the usual monthly pay is around 400 to 500 USD and GDP per capita hovers just below 10k$. The minimum wage in my country is essentially 150$ a month, and people actually live on it here.  I got lucky as I was born to a well-off family and could get a decent education, even had opportunity to travel abroad extensively, and now have nice career prospects. For most of my life, I have been fed with two equally misleading promises: A) working hard will get you an even better life, B) you shoud focus on migrating to the West (especially to the US) if you wish to reach the paradise. As you might guess, reality hits hard. 

Things started falling apart when my family fell out of grace with authorities and we had to cut our spendings by a lot. I've started working since first year into university to pull my weight and that's when I started to suspect something is not adding up. I now make roughly x3 of what a median worker makes, and I have no idea of how to get back to even the fraction of life I had with my parents as a child. My mother, bless her heart, had the opportunity to show me the world when she made roughly two times less than I do now. I dread the prospect of moving out of my parent's place. If I'd wanted to buy the flat I live in right now, I'd have to save *for 24 years straight without spending a cent* (that is considering the prices don't go up any more)*.* Suffice to say, not even my parents can now afford anything within the city. The official inflation rate the govs pretend to see is around 7%, the real inflation for just the past 6 months surpasses 40%. The food on the shelves becomes more expensive each day, the quality keeps diminishing. The universal healthcare praised by my country is so bad I'm literally afraid of going to a local hospital (I can't blame the staff though - they often have to survive on 300$ a month). The payment inflation adjustments are literally nonxistent in the majority of companies I know of, mine included (and I actually love the place I work in as I get full health coverage and plenty of benefits). Getting another education? Having kids? Moving out? Having a car? Might as well dream of owning a phallic rocket. 

Then I encounter this subreddit. At first, I'm livid. ""They must be mistaken"", I think, ""They must be lazy pricks who do nothing in life and want everything for free"". I was promised the American dream. I was told life would get better if I just made it to the other continent. If I was lucky or smart enough, or both. I have to admit, I hated this sub and every little post made here. I couldn't accept the fact that my dream was somebody else's nightmare. Still, I stick around, I read more, and with each post, each comment thread, I become more and more infatuated with the ideas spread here. I start normalizing common things like labor condition discussions and payment discussion in workplace (actually helped my colleague to negotiate a better deal not so long ago), I start standing up to my parents, who continue to preach their outdated capitalist mantras while steadily ruining their health for the sake of staying afloat, I start to indulge myself in political and economic discussions with my friends again, start re-reading Marx, Weber, Kant. 

I feel helpless, I feel derailed, I feel as though I'm denied a fraction of hope I had up to this moment, that somewhere across the ocean there is the perfect paradise for future rich hardworking me (ha-ha-ha). Turns out, it sucks being just a normal person no mater where you go. At the same time, I see that I'm not alone. I know I'm not mad, lazy or stupid. I know there is a big community of people who share my disdain with the rich and the powerful running this helltrain down the cliff for a quick buck - no matter the country you name. Most of all, I feel that this desire for change that unifies me with more than a million people across the world keeps growing and keeps getting stronger. 

Whether intentionally or not, this sub has become more than the sum of it parts. I'd like to thank each of you for making, keeping and growing this community. For saying out loud that we are not alone. That would be all from me.

My company was never really a remote work type of place. I won’t go into detail but most folks need to be onsite. That said, once the old pandy hit, the majority of people went remote. Because we hired a lot of folks during the pandemic we didn’t have desks for them full time combined with a work from home guideline for safety. Even after more departments started coming back, I’d say about 1/2-2/3 of the company is still remote, at least part time but most full time.

soubi3,Opinion: The modern American higher educational system is equivalent to the miner's company store of old,10,0.86,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/soubi3/opinion_the_modern_american_higher_educational/,18,"First and foremost I am not anti-intellectual and I am not anti-education. Very far from it in fact. I just believe that the quality of education in America is on par with the food provided at a public school.

College education has, especially for the last two generations, been treated as an absolute necessity to have any hope of living a financially stable life. The thing is, many statistics show (please feel free to correct me if I am wrong here) that less than 50% of college grads find a job in their studied field. On top of that student loans are the only type of debt that cannot be discharged under any circumstances except for death (and they'll still chase your estate if you have one). All signed up for by 17 and 18 year old young adults with absolutely no real concept of the working world and surviving on their own, as the system leading up to high school has taught them little of common life value like how to plan for and properly pay taxes, how to manage a personal budget, or any other necessary life skills. Certainly not how to manage tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that will literally follow you to your grave and beyond.

If you can think of a better way to prime a working class (lower all the way through upper middle) to accept sub par working conditions and wages I'd love to hear it. Many of the posts in here are merely symptoms of a system of coerced labor. I say the current educational model is one of many direct causes of the sickness of our system.

The craziest part to me is the professors who spend their days convincing these impressionable minds that they are being oppressed from every angle and then drive home in a Mercedes literally paid for by turning teenagers into debt slaves.

Again, I am not anti-education by a longshot. I love my tech and I need people smarter than me to keep making cool stuff so I can do cool stuff. And genuine open minded philosophical pursuit has driven mankind forward in ways that cannot be truly measured. I am not making character judgements on any individuals who are employed by the educational system. In fact, people very dear to me are teachers and I immensely respect the amount of effort they put into their work. I am simply making an observation about the current structure of the educational system.",1644458155.0

the two ems companies i have worked with have been awful. there were a lot of bad aspects of the job i was willing to deal with, but what really got me was management at one telling a room full of emts about two of our coworkers that were running nonstop calls for 24 hours and fell asleep at the wheel. they died and all management could say about it was that it was an act of god and couldnt have been prevented — “the crew did everything right; they did everything they could to keep themselves awake, but these things just happen”

ambulances never got the maintenance they needed. one of our rigs’ brakes failed while a crew was pulling into a children’s hospital. no one was hurt but the crew had been asking for maintenance to check it out for weeks and it wasn’t taken off the road. so many preventable safety hazards happened because the companies were managed like shit

The ""work"" of an employee is their product they sell to the company they work for. That's what the worker is to them. A product. 

And in capitalism, you should shop around and know the prices of the product you're selling.  And the prices in your area (office). 

But, they don't want people to share their wage information.

But you can't negotiate well if you don't know your local prices. And that's for any product in any business.. apples or labor. 

If you're selling apples, but they say you can't look at what all the other people selling apples are selling them for.. that's quite a disadvantage. 

In capitalism, you can gather your buying power to get better prices, like Walmart using all their stores to negotiate a lower price. 

But, unions are the same idea, gathering their product, labor, together to get a better price for the worker. 

They want capitalism for them, but not for the worker.  They want to close and control that market for labor as much as they can.  

This is just another reason why the system is fundamentally unfair.",1644520556.0

It appeared to have landed in my inbox as if by magic. I hadn't sent in a resume or crafted a tortured cover letter. None of the usual stuff. For once, someone had approached me.

I briefly talked to the recruiter on the phone, and little by little, I allowed myself to get my hopes up. The job most certainly wasn't a scam, and it would have been a huge step up, pay-wise, from what I'm doing now. For a brief second, I felt like I could breathe, like I might wind up doing something I could be proud of, the kind of job you'd assume an educated person my age would have.

I surmised that I had failed their editing test almost immediately after I sent it in. It was in PDF form, which I was unfamiliar with, and I spent half the time scrambling to figure out how to work the software, so I couldn't focus on the actual editing. When I looked at my responses after I sent the document back, I caught a couple of errors that never would have escaped me under normal circumstances. In this field, there is no margin for error.

I knew the inevitable ""thanks but no thanks"" call was coming, but I still held onto a small kernel of hope that they might be desperate enough to fill the position that they'd overlook those small mistakes. At first, the recruiter's voice sounded cheery, but when she switched to a ""thank you for taking the time to apply"" tone, I knew my instincts were correct. This is the closest I've ever come to a solid, decent, well-paid job in my life. Everything I've done up to now has been glorified slave labor.

I don't know how I'm supposed to keep living like this. I'm an intelligent person, but it means nothing because I don't have the funds, spare time, or mental energy to expand my skillset. I wish I were dead.",1644520511.0

No expressing any concern for my injury which was bad enough that I left work early the day before.  I'm the kind of person who NEVER calls out unless I'm in a hospital.  

It hurt my feelings a little but he's been much less personable and less empathetic as a boss.  It doesn't help that the owner of the company is a sociopath in my opinion.  She talks in a high pitched happy voice, as if she's praising a dog.  But stand up for yourself once and she lets her true colors show.

I have chosen to work for this company because COVID hit the former industry I was involved with pretty hard.

I absolutely love what the company stands for and has to offer. Securing a new job during these unprecedented times was really important to me.

Upon applying I didn’t necessarily ask for a bigger wage than what I was earning back then because the work-life balance and the extras provided made up for it. I figured I would just work hard to earn any raise I would be asking in the future.

Fast forward to one year later : my evaluation was the best I have ever gotten, I am meeting or exceeding all expectations and have also successfully taken over some extra responsibilities (which I am happy about in order to further develop my skills and help build my case).

When I requested a raise (without mentioning a figure) my direct manager fully understood why and told me he’d speak to HR (as it appears such things have to run through them).

Their feedback went along the lines of:
- Wth he is already asking for a raise?
- Does he know he can earn some extra money on a monthly basis based off his performances (note:it’s like 20$ max)
- Does he know his salary will be slightly raised on a regular basis?

This made me so mad because they are absolutely clueless about what I do in my job, how well I executed it, the added value I bring and the additional responsibilities I have taken over.
They are literally hiding themselves behind excuses to not look into it at all and are indirectly telling me: work as hard as you want, there is no such thing as rewarding hard working people around here. Be average at best, we don’t care.

I am now exploring two options:
- GTFO and never work for a state-owned company again
- Wait a bit for the COVID situation to improve even further, work on my skill set as much as possible and look for something else later this year",1644519253.0

First Thursday rolls around and my manager asks me if I want to work on Friday, I say no and he says you should expect to work every Friday for the next two months at least.

On what was to be my last day, we are wrapping up a Wednesday when the owner, as he walks out, tells the manager that we have to stay until everything is done (about 2 hours more work) and we have to wait around for a new shipment to arrive before we can even get started (being vague on purpose to not implicate things...).

Turns out not a single employee has worked at the company for longer than one year and they all told me stories of being verbally harassed by the owner.

I’ll do my best to not make this a rant, but in the 8 months since I’ve graduated I have applied to hundreds of jobs. For context, I have a bachelor’s in writing and have been applying to any job that corresponds with my degree. Most expect 5+ years of experience, most don’t bother to get back to me, and of the two jobs I landed I was let go from one due to budget cuts, and the other is refusing to negotiate fair wages after a messy hiring process. 

I signed a lease two weeks before I was let go from the first job, and with a minimal amount of savings and student loans starting in May, I’m beginning to worry that I won’t have a place to live in the next year. Everyone close to me who I speak to about this tells me not to worry, that things will be okay, that a job will come. It won’t. Nobody wants to pay a reasonable wage, and before you question a writing degree, jobs are very abundant— there are clear expectations of what I should be paid, but nobody wants to pay it. 

I’ve always wanted to edit and write books, but these jobs hardly glance at my application before turning me down. I’ve revised my resume again and again, and I know that there isn’t anymore I can do but wait for someone to finally take a second to consider me.

I immediately left the class that I was in and went to get tested on our campus. Luckily I tested negative, but since I know there are cases where people may not test positive until a couple days after you get exposed. With that in mind I decided to self isolate in my dorm and test everyday for the next 5 days. I informed my professors and bosses that I would not be going to class in person and I would not be going into work. One professor did not respond and the other gave me the zoom link for class. Both of my bosses said that if I tested negative I would be able to go into work, however one boss said that they were short staffed and that I would need to come into work. The other boss said that it was alright and wished me better health. 
I tested negative again today, but I decided to wuit my job with the boss that told me I needed to come in and took more hours at the other job. 
I quit for a multitude of reasons, that boss does not wear a mask in the market I work at, does not treat their workers well and always blames the night shift(I have problems with her before and her boss was no help), and I could already tell she was going to fire me if I did not go into work today. 
I did not think it would have been wise to have me work in the market, with no gloves, touching all of the food, when I could just be self isolating as a precaution.

Only real ones don’t support working. You see work is pretty much paid slavery that is exactly what it is and it is not right. Work is a offense and a spit in the face of freedom. Everyone should not work and find real meaning in their life not some fake meaning in life that is forced by slavers/employers.

spd0zj,Taking our solidarity to the next level with mutual aid,9,0.91,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spd0zj/taking_our_solidarity_to_the_next_level_with/,9,"I'm really happy to see the sub growing so much and all the well placed anger that's leading to positive change but I feel like there is still more that we can do. 

I really love the push towards unionization that I've been seeing lately, as well as the solidarity with strikes, but I still feel like we are missing a massive opportunity for more positive change. I know this sub is about combating work and improving working conditions and rights and unions and strikes do work to achieve that but there's still much they don't do.  

Workers can't have a successful strike if they don't have goods at home. They will faulter and return to work to survive. I know unions have strike funds for this purpose but also I know that the majority of union funds go to hiring lawyers for contract negotiations and other strictly wage and benefit side campaigns. [source](https://guide.unitworkers.com/union-dues-explained/)

That's where I feel mural aid organizations can come in and help for a multitude of reasons. 

1. Mutal aid can fill the material gap for successful strikes and unionization efforts:

""In organization theory, mutual aid is a voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions"" [source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory))

Mutal aid can take many forms, from community food banks, funds for eviction protection, bail and medical costs, to community gardens and offering someone a place to stay in your home[source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)). All these things can be very helpful ways in supporting union and strike efforts. Because resources are the main thing preventing people from successfully striking and unionizing. 

Let's face it as much as we hate our jobs in this horrible world we live in we need them to survive. That's why many people are afraid to try to fight for better working conditions because it threatens their work and their survival. But with mutal aid we can take that fear away and make unionization and striking easier. 

If people know their community will supply them with food when they might get fired for forming a union they will be more willing to take that chance. If a employer is being stubborn and not bending to union demands and the strike fund is running low mutal aid can keep the strikers supplied and starve the employer before the workers will breaks. If an employer tries to aquire desperate lower class people to work as scabs mutual aid can provide those desperate people the things they need so they won't scab on the strikers. Mutual aid can kill a lot of the dangers workers face with kindness. 

Mutual aid can be the vital support unions and strikes need to be more successful. If unions and strikes are the spear head that slays the dragon capitalism, mutal aid is the spear shaft that pushes the strike home. 

2. Mutual aid can help make allies, build a base of power, and enact equity:

This I feel is the major opportunity we are missing. Everyday we can see things getting worse. Inflation destroying saving, rent rising, massive and unnecessary debt keeping people from living good lives and a hundred other issues keeping the majority of people down. 

People need help but the systems that be have refused to help them and instead chose to capitalize on their suffering. This is where we as a community and as a movement can use mutual aid to provide people with the things they need and sway them to our cause. 

Because in all honesty lofty ideals, and sweet promises of a workers utopia won't change the minds of those who have had anti worker propaganda pounded into them since birth. The way we change their minds to our side is by helping them when no one else will. If we can show people that we can help them and provide for them when others dont, they might think differently about the left and the workers movement and might join us. They also might not and they might simply take our help and continue to hate us or refuse it all together. In my mind that's an acceptable outcome as even if we help someone who hates us it's still one less person suffering under capitalisms apathy and that's a victory in my book. 

Next building a base of power. The more we help people the more people will join us and make it easier to help more people. This is how we build our base of power to enter into the political game and try to make large scale change. 

Because again ideals and promises that get obstructed as soon as they hit the law makers floor won't change anyone's mind. We need victories and laws to change but we are facing obstruction from every side so we need a strong base of support to elect more radical representatives and be an undeniable voting block that demands change. 

With the obstruction we face we can't try to force people into office and be upset when they fail in a broken system. We need to start by building a base of power and then getting more people in office and gets our demands met. To that end we need to change people's minds by providing for them.

Lastly equity. There's a saying we hear a lot: that no one is free until everyone is free, and I strongly agree. This movement is still plagued with the individualism that built this sick capitist world. Every day we see stories about ""MY job sucks"" or ""MY boss sucks"" or ""I left MY old job and got a better one."" We have the right idea but we and stratified and disorganized. Quitting our jobs and asking for better things as individuals when we should be doing this as a movement. I still don't believe we have a concrete set of terms or demands as a movement. 

So it is great that we are trying to free ourselves here but we need to focus on freeing everyone especially those that can't free themselves. I'm talking about people who through generations of systemic neglect, or racism, or poverty, abuse and a thousand other things are trapped in horrible situations and places with little or no safety nets and forced to fight their neighbors out of desperation to survive. These people can't help themselves because they have to focus on surviving today. You can't make a better home or fight for worker rights when everyday is live or die. 

With mutual aid we can support the communities that need it most. We can have the solidarity and altruism we seek. Imagine if a head line read ""Flint's lead pipes fixed through the resources gathered by the anti-work mutual aid fund."" Can you imagine how big that would be? We would not only help those people that need it most but also show ourselves to the world and to the people that we are more capable and caring than the government and any rich person. 

Not only will it be good press but helping those on the lowest rung of society will make build new allies and loosen the chains capitalism has on us all. The lowest class of people are unfortunately a living threat to everyone above them. A sword hanging above our heads proclaiming ""stay in line or the suffering you see over there will be inflicted upon you"". By improving these people's lives and making safer, and healthier communities the threat evaporates and creates a new class of people no longer restrained with the effort of surviving everyday. With their needs met with our help they can also join in our cause of organizing and fighting for better conditions. 

When they are freed they can fight along side us until we are all freed. 

3. Mutual aid can create an alternative supply chain and aid in a general strike. 

With the broad and flexible definition of what mutual aid can be I see no reason why it couldn't be an effort to create an alternative supply chain. With mutual aid communities could pool their money and collectively buy the supplies they need. Better yet they could go to suppliers of food, medicine, clothing etc. And buy it from the source, whole sale and redistribute it to their communities. For enough money any supplier will take that deal. It could even be possible to build alternative supply routes with volunteers working as distributors of goods, traveling around their communities, or between communities to deliver, transport and aquire necessary goods.

Alternatively if funds are an issue communities could work to supply themselves internally. With community gardens, individuals working to preserve food that is grown, others working to build homes, furniture or devices that someone might need, others working as distributors. With the right organization any community could accomplish this. 

Either option would be beneficial for multiple reasons. First it would reduce the need for people to work to survive as their base needs are being met. They can instead focus on fighting for better working conditions or ceasing to work all together. Second it would reduce the reliance on capitalist supply chains that are exploitative and destructive as with a mutual supply chain there is no need for profit as the only goal is everyone is supplied which is a much more sustainable goal. Thirdly an alternative supply chain can improve the success of a general strike.

I've seen the idea of a general strike been tossed around here a few times, with a day set and then nothing to show for it. A general strike without organization and more importantly goods will always fail. Firstly because if no one agrees or let alone knows on what the plan is for a strike there can be no strike. With mutual aid networks a general strike can be coordinated more effectively as the people participating in the mutual aid network can be more clear about their needs and the needs of those they serve and given this information set a date for a strike would be most effective and most doable. 

Second an alternative supply chain can give people the resources they need to complete a general trike successfully. We've probably seen the idea by now based on the CDC new guide line that a 10 day general strike would shatter the economy and allow us to demand anything we want in order to return to work. However not everyone has the resources or access to 10 days worth of supplies. 

10 days is enough to kill people especially in the event of a general strike where food won't move, people won't be able to pick up medicine, people may be evicted, water or other utilities may be shut off from lack of payment or cruel retaliation, violence may be done. We can't count any injustice off the ruling class' table in order to break our will and end the strike. 

But with mutual aid and an alternative supply chain we can supply people with the things they need for the time necessary to succeed in a general strike and achieve the change we want to see. 


Hopefully you read this far and agree with what I wrote. I hope I laid out my thoughts in away that is understandable and convincing. I don't mind what's happening on the sub at all. There's solidarity, theres advice, there's support. But more direct action needs to be taken to make the changes we want to see. So I would thank you if you considered joining a mutual aid society, donating to one, volunteering, or making your own. In addition I have an idea for a large scale online mutual aid network similar to gofundme where people can donate directly to causes or fund they believe in. It can be a good place to organize and have funds in one place without capitalist interference but I don't have the skill to accomplish it so if someone wants to talk more about that please let me know. Thank you all and I hope you have a good day. 

Tldr; I believe for multiple reasons such as helping unions and strikes, making allies and helping others, and creating alternative supply chains for a general strike, that mutual aid(the collaborative and communal redistribution of willingly given resources) can achieve the changes we want to see.

I was recently hired for a remote position that requires a background check. Everything cleared except the prospective employer did not hear back from my university (US institution) while trying to verify my degree. I then requested a transcript myself, only to find out that apparently there is a hold on my account from the Bursar's office. When I contacted the Bursar's office they notified me that despite paying my tuition in full, there was a ""late payment fee"" of $100 from over 12 years ago. As a result, they aren't releasing my transcript. I was unaware I still owed this fee, furthermore employers in the past have contacted this University to verify my degree without issue. 

At this point in time I am unable to make this $100 payment. My bank account currently sits under $20. I lost my job due to the pandemic and having been surviving based on the generosity of a few friends over the past year or so. I am in Canada and we are still under pandemic restrictions. It is difficult to find employment at this time and this remote position is actually in my field with a liveable wage. I have explained this situation to the Bursar and Registrar and they are unwilling to budge. It's amazing that a university institution is working against me to obtain employment over a $100 ""late payment fee"" from 12 years ago. It always about the profit in the United States.

I got a new wage that was better than anything I've ever made and everybody thanked me for my work and treated me with respect. Now I am starting to see the problems. The ""for lifers"" in the plant all seem to think that they are the only ones worth a wage, and often like to gang up and put down those who are new and from other places. And whats even worse to me is what is often said behind these peoples backs. I have found out recently that they talk about me as well and It makes me feel very betrayed.

spcu8r,I work in a bar where we are now forbidden to eat meals.,4,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spcu8r/i_work_in_a_bar_where_we_are_now_forbidden_to_eat/,14,"Okay, so context: I work in a bar that has a restaurant attached to it. For the last two years we’ve been allowed to have one free shift meal. However, we’ve never been given meal breaks to eat this meal and have to do it in about 5 minutes as a barback watches the bar so we can go back to working our 6-13 hour shifts. Staff has always just put up with this because free food and the tips at this place are really good. 

Recently, however, we were notified that we cannot ever eat behind the bar during our shifts. (This makes sense as it’s a health code violation, but my coworker got in trouble for eating a jolly rancher when the place was empty.) So the jolly rancher has now led the owners to decide that not only are they going to take away our free meals from the restaurant, but that we are not allowed to EVER eat when we are clocked in. This means for shifts that range from 6 to 13 hours, we will not be able to eat anything. We will not be able to eat food we bring in, have delivered, or even pay for a meal at the restaurant we work in (because free shift meals have also been eliminated.) We are not allowed to have our legally required 30 minute meal breaks either. 

So I just wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any advice on what to do about this. I know what they’re doing is illegal, but I’m in NY, where filing any complaint with the department of labor has taken 1.5-5 years to even be addressed (I’ve filed two complaints against prior restaurants in the past and neither have reached a resolution yet.)

Also, none of this has been put in writing. All employees are having verbal meetings with management about the new policies. So I’m really at a loss as to what can be done. I actually really like my job and the money is great. But I will be damned if they expect me to work 13 hours without eating a thing.",1644516423.0

I shouldn’t have to ask “permission” to take time off when I need it or want it. I am perfectly happy to notify my employer that I will be taking time off as a general courtesy to them, and work on a plan to ensure tasks and projects run smoothly in my absence. I am also happy to consider tweaking my plans if it puts significant strain on the team. But submitting a request to take off the time and await approval is patronizing and disrespectful to us as human beings. We’re not peasants working for the lord of the estate.

I work so that I’m able to do the things that are meaningful and enriching to me and my family, and to support the things I love. My life isn’t my job. My job is a means to live my life. I’m renting my time and skills to my employer. They do not own my time and decide how I spend it.

Also, you can take more than 2 or 3 weeks of vacation per year. Just because you’re employer only offers 2 or 3 weeks of paid vacation doesn’t mean you are limited to that time frame. That is insane. You can take more than that, it’s just unpaid. Employers need to stop thinking they own your time and have the right to dictate how and when you spend it.

Can we start calling these Time Off Notices? And can we start being more firm on telling our employers that we will be taking the time when we choose? And also give ourselves permission to take more than 2-3 weeks of vacation, even if it is unpaid?",1644516169.0

Second elephant, minimum wage, R$1.005,00 per month, something between $170~190 american dolars... It's very low, this means that if you don't have a degree, you are going to strugle to find something far from the minimum.

Third elephant, average cost of living can vary a LOT depending on where you live, Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world distributed mostly vertically acros the globe, this means someone up in the north may have a life style completelly ALIEN to someone in the south and vice-versa, as I live in the south, I can only speak about it, I have no base whatsoever to tell you about cost of living in other states rather than mine... 

Rent of a small cozy house on a developing suburb in a small city can cost you R$500,00 ($70~90), that alone got you down to half your money... If you want a car, banks will gladly make you a loan, assuming you got a shitty old car for R$12.000 ($2.000~2.200), your bill by the month could be somewhere between R$400 to 600 ($70~110), and there is the other half of your minimum wage...

Most people I know earn something about R$1.500 and 2.000 ($300~400), wich make living a lot easier, but not a bit fancy, you just get by with this...

BUT

A very strong point about Brazil is that you have MANY more rights as a worker than in the US, Brazil is actually know for how well it protects the workers, OF COURSE this isn't a general rule, but the laws exists and those who know about their rights and didn't screw up somehow WILL most likelly have it done, here are some of the main rights...

13th salary, here we are paid by the month, but at the end of the year EVERY registered worker have an extra salary, essentially making your 12th month pay double.

EVERY worker have 30 paid vacation days.

Maximum 8 hours daily at work, anything over that, you have a bonus payment of 50% by the hour on week days or 100%(!!!) on holidays and sundays OR you can have a think called ""hours bank"", where if you work an extra hour today, you can work a hour less tomorow.

Paid weekly day-off, mostly sundays, your boss is paying for that.

Unemployent plans, if you haven't been fired by just cause, you have that

Garanty fund by time worked, essentialy, the company you work on HAVE to make an deposit of 8% your salary (not taken out of it) every month, if you happen to be fired but not just cause fired, you will have all the amount stored PLUS 50% as fine.

Among MANY others, I cound't possibly make a full on workers rights on a Reddit post in one day...

And also remmember, healthcare here is COMPLETELY FREE, yes, I know this is a whole new other topic, but to summarise, it can be awfull in some places and absolutelly fucking great in others

But anywhere in Brazil, insulin costs nothing

There have been jobs my husband and I have taken (not together) where once we started, we learned that the company doesn't give references.

It also means that you can be a giant tool and they won't tell anyone. Most large companies hire this task out to 3rd party companies. You can find out their reference policy by calling HR.

I used to manage a small boutique and we have very limited staffing so I wasn’t always able to finish certain tasks when I had to be on the floor. It was holiday season so things get kind of crazy especially in a retail setting. I don’t have much experience and I had only been working there for a month, but when my boss offered me the position of assistant manager I was ecstatic and accepted immediately thinking that it would be the perfect opportunity to grow professionally (since I do not have a degree I’m really starting from the ground up). 

An important piece of the story is that I have had a very rigid experience with anxiety, depression and ptsd so at times I would be very anxious about getting my tasks done. I also have had a hard time finding access to medication so it’s very intense for me when it’s flaring up. Honestly looking back on it, I probably would not have accepted the position if I had known my anxiety would be so bad during this period of time. But anyway this particular coworker of mine, we will call her Sarah, is someone every one gets along with and is someone you would definitely call “the life of the party” and she is usually at the center of the conversation. We were friends at first and she seemed cool, but sometimes she would take little jabs at me in different ways. There were times I did my best not to take it personally, but then she started telling me I was in “crisis mode” when I would be visibly frustrated or anxious. That’s how it started. It was once in a while starting out but then it became a running joke for her any time I was uncertain about something. That and she would constantly tell me that I’d be over thinking while I go through my creative process. Sarah would even tell me I was in crisis mode if I commented on the fact that I wasn’t in love with my outfit that day. It became especially  frustrating to be around because she would occasionally do nice things for me like give me a ride home or the time she gave me a beautiful fruit danish on my birthday. I started to feel very conflicted about whether or not she was really being dismissive and rude or if I was just taking it the wrong way. My boss is really big on being all inclusive with staff and making sure everyone has a voice which I really respect, but Sarah would oppose me when I would ask her to do simple tasks or make suggestions as a manager. She makes sly comments about my personal performance (honestly going down the toilet at this point because my insecurities were really getting the best of me) while she really half asses a lot of her own projects and looks for ways to get out of doing work. Sometimes I’d have to come in on days I would be coming down from an anxiety attack/ptsd episode and claimed she understood and even knew people who also had ptsd but would continue to act dismissive toward me like I was making her uncomfortable by being there. 

Also an important side note about my boss: She and I were also growing closer around this time because I was spending a lot of time working for her outside the boutique. She was extremely easy to talk to and believed that we (her staff) should  always create space for one another to share how we feel and communicate about it in an ethical way. This would later become a problem since it’s a small boutique with only women working there lol. 

I began to feel extremely anxious at work when I started to notice that it was viewed an inconvenience for me to go into the office to work on managerial duties rather than being on the floor. It would take me a while to get things done sometimes due to me being easily distracted, but I explained to my boss and my coworkers many times that this has always been a struggle for me and I am doing the best I can with what I have. 
At a certain point I was so stressed out from the work load, my boss’s tendency to remind me that I’m only the assistant to the manager but then treat me as if I am the manager (she’s a Gemini btw), and the regular jabs from Sarah that it began to affect my mental health even more than usual. I wasn’t taking care of myself at home and I dreaded going to work. My heart was breaking because I genuinely loved my job at first and I thought it was a perfect place to be creative and grow professionally, but as holiday season was coming to an end I decided to step down as the assistant manager. 

Once I told Sarah the news she of course began to go on about how it’s really for the best and she’s so happy that we will all get to work on marketing together (this was my ONE JOB). She seemed to care at first and would ask me how I’m feeling about it all, but she wouldn’t stop talking about it even after I had asked her if we could talk about something else since I was pretty bummed out. She would occasionally bring it up off and on to other coworkers about how much better everything will be now that I have stepped down. She would always claim that other people felt the same way she did when we would have conversations about why everything went downhill but I just couldn’t believe her. Idk why. 

After about a week of me being back as an associate I came in early one morning to clean (I had permission to do so) and when Sarah and the new new manager came in I had told them that everything was ready for opening and if they would mind doing the daily display we create every morning so I can run upstairs and do my make up really fast — big big mistake lmao. My manager came up to tell me that I was not allowed to come in early any more since I have already been going into overtime, and I can’t put on my mascara on the clock because “it’s just not right” LOL. I understood and that was that. Throughout the day I kept my head down and stayed busy. I wasn’t interested in talking to Sarah and our new manager who had become friends almost immediately (shocker). I felt grounded about it and didn’t want to put off any weird vibes but I did pretty much stay quiet. This job is kind of weird like that. When you work in retail they expect you to be bubbly and talkative to each other and the customer 24/7 at least in my boss’s mind. It’s girl world over here and I was in the process of checking out. But later that day Sarah decided that she wanted to have a say in what apparently happened that morning. She proceeded to scold me saying that she couldn’t believe that I would have the “audacity” to ask them to create the display so I could do my make up, and that me coming in early to do extra tasks (because I never had time when I was a manager) was “weird” and me choosing to stay quiet was “weird.” I didn’t even hesitate. My response was “are you fucking kidding me?” I was furious. She has been disrespectful to me for months and I chose to be passive because I thought it wasn’t that big of a deal but now that I’m not the manager anymore she is really going to treat me like a problem? I was belligerent. I didn’t hold back but I did. I was tearful. Completely unprofessional. But I had had enough of her. 

I went to my boss later that day to ask her for help and have a moment of honesty with her about how I reacted. She agreed with me that I had every reason to be upset but told me I needed to work it out with her because we can’t coordinate schedules so I don’t have to see her and she will not have a toxic work environment. I went to Sarah and apologized for how I reacted. I literally gave her the benefit of the doubt. Since then we have had a couple more rigid interactions with each other and now all I can do is keep my head down and just take her bullshit. I talked to my boss a couple of times about finding a different job but she has expressed that she needs me to stay. I just don’t see how I can continue to let myself stay in this toxic situation. And finding another job already has me freaked out because I have had such bad anxiety and this whole experience was a nightmare.  I want to stand up for myself but I know it won’t go over well.",1644515311.0

This friend and manager have constantly had time off pulled away from them, not seeing a day off in likely several weeks -- And the effect is definitely noticeable.

Long story short: I, the only full-time 100% remote person on my team, finally had the opportunity to speak candidly to a fellow team member about our boss's abusive behavior. I had no idea any one was experiencing the same thing I was. Our boss is a fake southern nice person, who regularly belittles us and since she has decided she doesn't like us both has essentially stopped giving us work but little ""projects"" that are pointless and regularly leave us with no feedback or results from our work. My team member called to ask about a project that he's working on that I essentially completed last week. So I sent him my final project but that led us to talk. Our boss displays clear favoritism, he's confirmed that everyone (including those she favorites) hate them, and that he's also suffered verbal abuse from them. The only difference is when they did it to me via email and slack, I gave them a freaking tongue lashing over zoom and reported them to HR. they haven't been outright rude to me in awhile because of it. So he's suffering a little more from that than me. They tell us consistently that we should look at other companies and jobs too. But we also figured something out, they love trauma dumping on us. All the personal issues they are going through and regularly tells both of us in our 1:1s, and mind you most of their bad behavior happens when they are interacting with us individually and is a little (but not much) covert when in a group (I guess they consistently tell my team member in meetings that they knows he's afraid of them Infront of other people under the guise of a ""joke""). I told him to do what I do and just do what's asked and not a thing more and keep collecting that paycheck. He was in shock but I pointed out I have been with the company longer than most of the team including manager. I also told him to send all his notes on their interactions to HR because they already have a few complaints thanks to yours truly. 

But my real question is, since they keep regularly trauma dumping on us and doing other toxic behavior, could we tell HR that we fear they are  not mentally well enough to continue leading the team since they keep taking it out on us and mistreating us a clear result of their ""issues"" both at home and in the workplace?",1644514686.0

When asked about the paycheck expectations I said 2 500 - 2 600 bruto, but now that I think about it more, I want to ask for more. Why more? Here are the reasons: they contacted me (even though they knew that I live in the Netherlands), I would have to move several countries away, job is in microbiology field and a quick Google search says that average salary for that field in Switzerland is around 3 000 euros, somewhere I even saw 4 000 euros. It was a fairly quick notice and I didn't have too much time to do some research amd prepare before the phonecall, but they suggested that we will remain in contact and even organise a video meeting.

My question is are the reasons stated above good enough to ask for that much money? I don't know what's the normal salary for that field, because I originally come from a shitty country with low standards, and I want to match Swiss standards.

The big problem was that they had us very specifically orientate the labels and a specific way because they were 'twisting' as the labels were applied, order of them being done one then two made no difference.

After doing almost 300 of them the leads came back and said that they were done wrong and that they were twisted. My partner and I were doing them exactly as directed and they were coming back wrong.

The one exception was when I left a manufacturing job to work for FedEx because they were offering $3/hr more than what I was making at the time but after two weeks I couldn’t handle the mental and physical toll it was taking on me.

So I guess my point is I’m noticing a correlation that the jobs where employers are doing nothing to make it more efficient for their employees are usually the ones paying as little as they can get away with.

“On May 1, 1886, 350,000 workers staged a nationwide work stoppage to demand the adoption of a standard eight-hour workday. Forty thousand workers struck in Chicago, Illinois; ten thousand struck in New York; eleven thousand struck in Detroit, Michigan. As many as thirty-two thousand workers struck in Cincinnati, Ohio, although some of these workers had been out on strike for several months before May 1.

The purpose of the May Day Strike was to bring pressure on employers and state governments to create an eight-hour workday.”

“On the morning of February 6, 1919, Seattle, a city of 315,000 people, stopped working. 25,000 other union members had joined 35,000 shipyard workers already on strike. The city's AFL unions, 101 of them, had voted to walk out in a gesture of support and solidarity. And most of the remaining work force stayed home as stores closed and streetcars stopped running. The city was stunned and quiet.”

Industrial unionism was proving its mettle, and unions used audacious tactics, including sit-down strikes and roving pickets. When bosses compelled local governments to launch crackdowns or even summon the National Guard, many workers, both employed and unemployed, came to the defense of strikers. It was the ferocity and tenacity of those fighters that pressured Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, establishing the collective bargaining rights that so many are trying to preserve today.”",1644512793.0

As of 2018, 50% of Americans in the workforce had a net income of 32,000 or less, including contributions to retirement plans as part of that #.

If you're wondering why we're in such dire circumstances, there's your answer.

Also, it appears that 71% of Americans made less than 52,000 net, including employer contributions to retirement plans as ""income."" 

There aren't 75,000,000 ""better jobs"" for half of America. Sorry.",1644511931.0

spb0ln,I was fired to preserve a coworker’s ego,2,0.67,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spb0ln/i_was_fired_to_preserve_a_coworkers_ego/,5,"For ~7 months, until last Thursday (technically Monday), I worked a 12hr shift factory job. I would love to name it but they only have one plant in my state and I’d rather not doxx myself. Like with every job until now, I became the well known “yes man” there, and the one to push all extra tasks onto. There was never a complaint about me and I never complained about anyone else despite being borderline harassed by all around terrible people.

I had coworkers who snuck off the bathroom to do drugs. One ended up breaking her arm on shift and refusing to go to the hospital just so she didn’t have to do a drug test (it was honestly pretty impressive). A coworker who watched porn while working machines. A coworker who openly bragged about baby trapping a minor. A coworker who cussed out another coworker over not being allowed to borrow a broken fan; she was simply moved to a more well ventilated area. A coworker who split her arm open because she wasn’t wearing safety gear and was rewarded with a promotion to “Head of Safety”. 

Towards me, I was constantly taken advantage of by coworkers who belittled me. I had to leave early Once because my brother got in a nearly fatal car crash. When I came back the next day someone asked what my emergency was. I told him and the guy said “my brother died and I had the common decency to finish my shift. Now come ‘ere and break out my girlfriend we need a cigarette”. That guy and another lady I’ll call C (the one whose ego I was fired to protect) forced me to go in a machine that wasn’t locked out once because they “didn’t feel like waiting for maintenance”. Him, C, and ~5 other people are all friends from the same class at the local high school who still haven’t realized school ended 20+ years ago. Most things are set to cater to their group. When C is mean (all the time), 6 other people are ready to jump in to say “she’s just like that it’s just the way she is”.

Well, last Thursday, I was put with two new coworkers (their 3rd day, my first working with them). One was C’s daughter. The other was some girl (B) who looks like she belongs on a white couch with a couple teal pillows. She openly refused to follow ANY rules; she must have sucked a dick or brought proof of a DNA match in management to get in because even the shift supervisor folded after a couple minutes of trying to get her to follow protocol. Just said “fine, do it how you want just for today” and walked away. 

She was already rude, which in itself whatever, but she took this as “I am above you” and started acting accordingly. There were two stations and she chose to work with me just to be able to push my buttons. She was snatching stuff from me, ransacking my work station, calling me a bitch, and at the end of it didn’t even get anything done. As always I kept my head down and worked… Until the last snatching straw (4th time) where I told her to get her own station if she was gonna act like a bitch in mine. 

It was the first time I’d ever snapped at work so I went to step outside and then give C a scheduled break. I was ~15 minutes early for it so I briefly explained with “sorry, I got a little heated at my station and came to see if you wanted a break”. She went OFF on me about “you better not be talking about my daughter, that [other] girl’s my daughter and I don’t want to hear a single word” etc etc. I just said “oh no no, I don’t have a problem with her. I had a little problem with the other one but it’s fine”. C said “you’re being way too argumentative, I’m going to tell the supervisor about your attitude issue”.

As always, her 5 minute break was a 20 minute and lo and behold at the end of it, the entirety of upper management comes to walk me to the offices. I’m sat down in a conference room with B and C. C straight up LIES about what I said to her (“oh she came over cussing up a storm” … I didn’t use any profanity with C). B sugarcoats it to shit kicking it off with “first of all, I am so sorry you guys have to be dealing with this so early in the morning. I hope you can continue to have a relaxing day soon”. I gave my side of the story and C even said “… well yeah, that does sound pretty accurate. BUT I didn’t like the attitude. I don’t know, I don’t care what else happened”.

They said they would look into the issue, had me write a statement, and sent (only) me home. I was told I’d receive a call with their decision the next day (Friday). I was supposed to come back Monday at 7am, so on Sunday when I hadn’t heard anything I texted my boss to ask if I was good to come back. She said she’d get in touch with the plant manager as soon as she could. Monday at 10am, I get a call. They say they “think it’s best to relieve me from my assignment, but I’ll get no bad recommendation from them and I’m a great worker who they’re sure will have no problem finding another job”. 

If I’m such a great worker, why fire me? Using profanity once? Then why not fire the girl who used it first on top of refusing to follow any of your precious protocol? Why not fire the lady who cussed out an old woman because she couldn’t borrow a fan that ended up being broken? Firing me was the only way to keep C happy when she claimed her ego had been affronted, and still haven’t ruled out my earlier theories about B’s employment. My boyfriend still works there and said B and C were transferred to work together. 

Either way, they were willing to risk two people’s entire livelihood on preserving the ego of one terrible employee and another good but consistently very rude one. I’m now jobless because my company bent over for someone who openly refuses to follow rules and someone else who pretends to be incapable of basic human decency/throws a temper tantrum if they convince themselves someone else is acting the same way. 

But hey, I get a good recommendation from them. Lucky me.",1644511773.0

spafm3,Talking about unemployment/underemployment,0,0.5,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spafm3/talking_about_unemploymentunderemployment/,4,"Hey everyone, I'm checking out this subreddit for the first time. After reading a few recent posts, I thought I'd post something and ask if anyone else has had similar experiences.

I graduated from college five years ago with a music degree, and I have been chronically underemployed ever since. That's not to say I haven't been busy in that time, quite the contrary actually. On top of internships and other short-term jobs, I've gone to career counseling, I've stayed active in the communities I've been in, I've been making a lot of music (writing, singing, and performing, etc.), and I've done my best to make as many connections as I possibly can, and I legitimately think I've done a good job of all of that up to this point.

After managing to live alone for two years, I had to move back in with my parents a while back, which in itself isn't too bad, except for that they sometimes make snide, condescending comments about my lack of employment. I often find myself having to basically defend honor from accusations of laziness or lack of willingness to work. Even when I tell them stories of the BS I've come across in the process of job hunting and how I've been putting in the work to try to make something work out, nothing seems to help.

And it's not just in the home either; I've noticed that just about everyone treats me differently when they find out I'm unemployed (pity, condescension, even anger sometimes). When the topic comes up, I often tell people that I'm looking for work, but haven't found anything yet, and they usually scoff my supposed lack of work ethic and how it's my fault for not just taking any of the jobs available. After all, there are pLeNtY Of jObs AvaiLAblE nOWaDaYS, and WhY diD YoU geT a MYoÖsiK deGREe iF YoU waNt eLECtrICity AND a rOof oVEr YoUR heAd??

But when it comes to types of jobs I'm looking for, it's not just with the goal of moving out of my parents' in mind. I'm also an expensive guy to keep healthy, and I often have to spend over $1000/month in medical and therapeutic costs just to keep myself functional (gotta love the US ""Healthcare"" system), so it's like I have to pay rent twice - once to keep a roof over my head and twice just to live in my own body. 

Honestly, I wonder if it's worth moving abroad to try to start over in a place where I can afford to live and function and where my talents and experiences would actually be valued.

I guess all of this is to say, I'm having a really hard time navigating this world as a young, underemployed person, and I don't know what all I can do about it. It feels so hopeless sometimes. Honestly, I don't even know if I'm writing this for advice or just hear others' experiences or whatever, I just thought I'd write this to see what everyone has to say, because it seems like I'm not alone.",1644510229.0

I was written up for these abcenses, told I would be fired if I continued to miss work, and didn’t recieve our monthly bonus because of it. Is that legal (USA)?

Full story:

I have severe chronic migraines. I’ve been seeing a neurologist for a few years now, and am trying to figure out how to manage them. Without treatment I was having headaches everyday with 3-4 migraines a week. With treatment I currently see ~2 a week. They typically start in the morning right before I wake up or 2-4pm, and more sporadically if certain triggers occur.

Because I’m new I can’t qualify for FMLA. So when a migraine occurs on a work day I miss part of the day but do work some that day, but rarely the full day. The time I’m miss is to migraines or dr appt is unpaid because we don’t have paid sick leave and minimal PTO.

When I’m out I notify my work before I need to be out, and let them know updates on when I will be coming in. My supervisor is not very understanding of this. I was asked if I would be willing to share health information so they could know what was going on. I offered to get written documentation of my condition and explained what migraines were and the medication I take to help prevent them.

They asked what could be changed to help reduce them. I mentioned that the office lighting was a trigger, I also said that a flexible work schedule or hybrid option would be beneficial. I noted that at a previous job being remote during COVID lock downs helped reduce the time I was out for migraines, and that integrating work from home days may help. My job can be done fully remote (and has been when coworkers tested positive or if weather is bad). When I’m in the office I almost never talk to others in person, almost all communication was on email or virtual meetings. The most interaction I have with people is passing them on the way to the bathroom. I asked if I could have a later starting and stoping time (30-60m later), or if I could possible work from home on migraine days to cut back on time on time that is spent on getting ready/commuting.

They asked if my doctor could make any treatment changes. I explained that limitations my current medications have and said that I could talk to my doctor about it but I couldn’t get an appointment for a couple of months because of the health backlog.

They said that a different start time wasn’t an option because the office is strict with its work times. They mentioned that I could possibly still work later in the evenings if I had a late day, but never followed up with getting me the security information I would need to stay. They also said that work from home was not preferred because of how our department is viewed by the rest of the company due to its traditional culture. They mentioned possibly having a single day at home until my appointment but that never fully happened. The bought a cover for my cube. They said that we’d check in after I met with my doctor.

During that time between my supervisor was very persistent in their concerns about me being absent. They asked if I had considered getting a piercing to help my migraines or if I had told my doctor how many migraines I get. They said they were shocked that someone as young as me could be this ill. They said that my absences impacted what we could achieve. They said my work quality is great and what they need but they want me to do more.

I disagreed about on my productivity, but didn’t say anything. My work has been consistent with deadlines and delays presented to be from my supervisor or other coworkers. Many of these delays come from my supervisor due to either poor communication from them or lack of response altogether. Issues that my other coworkers also have with this person. I told them that I understood their concerns and would have an update after my doctors appointment like we discussed.

My doctors appointment happened and a week after I was pulled into a meeting to see if there was improvement, and to also let me know that I was being written up for the amount of time I had missed because it violates the companies excessive absence code (that’s nonspecific about time). I was told that if they didn’t see a significant decrease in absensses within 30 days I would be terminated (which means no healthcare). Again they mentioned everything I did was great, they just wanted me in the office more. I also did not get our monthly bonus ($100) for the company hitting above sales estimates, because a write up dissqualifies you for that month.

I’ve talked to my coworkers about it and that they disagree about it being an issue, saying that it had never been an issue for them and that I’ve always been available when they needed me, and that I always get them what they need. They mentioned that they have also been having issues with supervisors expectations and critiques.

I’ve been at my job for almost 2.5 years (minus the month I was laid off at the start of covid 🙃). Some background: I’ve never gotten benefits, pto, insurance, etc. and have always felt like I’ve been underpaid. I get paid hourly and have gotten a total of $3/hr raise since I’ve been here. There’s also been times where I’ve been very much overworked and felt extremely burnt out, with no pto making it really hard to take a break for myself. I slowly started job hunting a few months after starting but with my mental health not being in the best place it’s been very challenging to work and job hunt full time. Over the past year I’ve always started up an Etsy shop while wfh which has started becoming pretty successful. 

All of those factors finally lead me to deciding it was time. I gave my notice yesterday after a long day of nerves and expectedly they’re now trying to do anything to get me to stay (except of course give me any sort of benefits 🥲). My boss told me how talented I was, how I was a part of their long term plans (which I haven’t heard until now), and how he’d love to try to adjust my salary to account for insurance and pto (which I guess I would still have to figure out?). I stood my ground though and told him my last day. My other boss emailed me this morning with a similar sentiment saying how they all really really don’t want to lose me and I would always be welcome back. 

SO In my mind they realize they fucked up by not paying me my worth and are trying to scramble now.

spa37s,I did an online interview for Amazon a few weeks ago.,8,0.75,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/spa37s/i_did_an_online_interview_for_amazon_a_few_weeks/,7,"I have no choice as I'm currently unemployed and beggars can't be choosers. I have no savings, no insurance. But one thing struck me.

During the interview they asked me a total of SIX TIMES if I do more than I'm paid for.

The questions basically made 2 statements and you have to choose which one you agree more. So they'd say ""You set achievable and reasonable goals"" VS ""you are motivated by challenges"". Stuff like that boils my blood because it's basic brainwashing. 

They stated it six different ways. I can't remember all of them but one was ""Do you regularly go above and beyond your duties?"" and another was ""Do you set high expectations for yourself?"" and another was ""Do you always try to do more than what is expected of you?""

I counted the same question six times and my answer remained the same every time.

Amazon. No one ever works for more than they're paid for unless they're forced to. That is called wage theft and it's the reason Bezos has a 430 million euro yacht while his employees are dying in his warehouses.

The hours sucked but the work was somewhat relevant to my field. Currently I am taking 19 credit hours and simply did not have the time for the job anymore, the hours were overnight and evenings on the weekend. 

I sent my notice in on Sunday, the upcoming weekend I was scheduled to work overnight, I could not do this as I have two projects due the following week, I told my manager this three weeks ago and he decided to continue having me work that shift. He did not want to be flexible so I quit.

Fast foward to this monday, I receive a call at 7am. The managers boss calls me and starts to berate me, ""What you did is so dissapointing."" Also, ""This makes me question your character as you can't be reliable."" I have not seen this man since I was interviewed by him. He went into how he did ""22 credits a semester while in the military."" I don't think they even allow that. He also wanted to tell me how I had ""an obligation"" to continue working there. I am not under a contract and told him I could leave at any point, I have no obligations and my only obligation is to finish my degree this coming May. 

I have worked here for a year and half, shown up to every shift, done extra shifts when people have quit without any notice but I am unreliable. They only hire students for this position and can't find students who would even want to work overnight. I fought back on the phone and as soon as he knew he couldn't bully me into staying, he wanted to end the conversation.

My main concern in this situation is that I used to use the manager (who I like and he has been a good reference in the past), and now with his boss telling me how poor my ""character is"" I don't know if this can be considered a good reference anymore. I'm fairly concerned with even letting my future employment oppurtunites contact them. Thoughts?",1644509085.0
sp9yvk,"Unsure if my work conditions are fair or if I'm being underpaid, plus unsure what to do about work agreement",1,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sp9yvk/unsure_if_my_work_conditions_are_fair_or_if_im/,1,"I guess I should start by saying that when I was 16, I had basically no self confidence, self worth, or anything of the sort due to many issues from childhood caused partly by my dad and partly not

When I turned 16 and I could officially work, my dad asked for me to work in the family business, so he  thought up an agreement that he'd be able to choose my wages and in exchange I'd obtain the business when he retired which we agreed to verbally in front of my mother (Back then I would've agreed to anything he said due to the above)

At first I just worked 3 hours on weekends without pay, which became around 11 hours, per week when I was 18, and 19 hours since I was maybe 20, all but 3 of those hours being during the week

When I was 18 I was paid maybe $19 AUD per hour until around mid year (maybe 4 months) where we started struggling due to the time of year (by then it was about August which is late Winter here) so he asked if I could go without pay until we started picking up again

I was still in the same mindset as above at this point so I agreed, but even though we started picking up again in October (2 months later, I was 18 1/2) he didn't start paying me again until I was maybe 21 (about 3 years ago)

My new pay became $400 per week (about $21.05 AUD per hour) along with some other benefits (like a company car that costs less than $5k, health insurance, car insurance, registration, and sometimes petrol) and I was still living with him, so all bills were paid, but this meant he also wanted me to do a ton of stuff for him at home, both business related and personal, so I didn't have much time to myself given others also wanting my time. 

I do live with my mother for now but I pay her 1/4 of my weekly wages ($100) to help her with the bills, plus she uses me as a buffer, so if she ever can't afford something she can lean on me for support like a lender that doesn't charge interest since ""I don't spend my money as is"" (because I was saving for bigger things, like a new computer, a loan to buy my own home, etc. And we're not talking $50 here, $100 there, but she owed me about $10k at one point total)

However, a few months later our secretary left to work at a different company, but instead of hiring a new Secretary, he instead put all her responsibilities on my shoulders along with my old ones, but didn't even pay me a cent per week more

Now I no longer live with him, which means it's down to just the car and health related bills he pays for, yet he still asks me to help him with a lot of stuff outside of work hours which are both business related and personal, and he only pays for my health stuff because I'm under his health cover, which will end in the next 12 months since I will no longer be a student (I do Uni)

For what we do, it's mostly customer service, filling out paperwork, inspecting cars (checking numbers and taking photos), and signing paperwork that comes in the mail. Some days, however, can be so busy that we don't slow down until 3:30 pm, with no breaks during the day, while other days can be a bit slow, so he goes out the back to work on his personal projects while leaving me to serve people as they come, so I keep myself occupied between customers. For me, I also have to do emails, talking to customers, businesses we purchase things from like Officeworks, his accountant, his lawyer (A lot of people don't like him because of jealousy and my mother having been a whistle-blower from 25 years ago), I also deal with filing of receipts and such and also deal with other bookkeeping responsibilities (I've done an accounting course so I'm qualified to do so)

Some of these things I do outside of our normal business hours so I don't get paid for that stuff

He's also threatened to restrict my wages further due to making a couple mistakes, even though he has made a ton more that he has also put on my head in the past (which he says is common in other workplaces), he's also threatened to sell the business whenever he gets mad, which completely goes against our agreement, and I'm concerned it may not just be a threat one day

Finally he has spoken to his accountant and they both agree he shouldn't retire, but instead give most responsibilities to me (Including having to be ready to answer phone calls 12 hours per day, where he can have 100 calls per day some days, meaning I won't ever have any time where I can focus on other things without constantly being disturbed by calls until 9pm, even though he said we do this so I can afford to have the lifestyle I want, which I won't be able to have at that point), and he hasn't said anything about me getting a raise anytime soon

For those wondering, he says I can ask him for things whenever I want them, but if he doesn't approve of it he will always deny my request, so I never ask for stuff since I know he'll always decline

So overall I want to know at what point (if any) it has become unfair, and what I should do in terms of if I should stay or leave. Any feedback is helpful as I genuinely don't know how fair this is, and for reference the minimum wage for retail as of June 2021 has been $20.33, so 72c less than I get",1644509001.0

i chose to limit my availability because my boyfriend and i have made a point to set several winter weekends aside to spend time together and go on little trips. we live an hour away from each other, and due to the seasonal nature of both our jobs, we’ll have quite limited time together in the warmer months. 

anyway, i made sure to tell the boss up front, and he said that was fine, they were desperate for help. and yet, every time he makes a schedule, he bitches at me about not being available friday/saturday nights, tells me i’m making things really difficult for him. he has a bit of a temper, so i’m refraining from saying anything sassy, but i REALLY want to ask him, well would it be better for you if i quit? i’m sick of being made to feel guilty over things that are truly not my problem and could easily be solved by better management. besides, i know for a fact i’m the most reliable and efficient worker he has right now. sorry not sorry for prioritizing other aspects of my life over work, dude. figure it the fuck out.",1644508701.0

I’ve been a lurker of this sub for a while and never really considered posting anything because my job is not too bad and I have almost nothing I can complain about it — At least until now.

I work for a staffing company that provides personnel to a Resort for a plethora of roles, my work consists of finding the best people I can and get them to work. Sounds easy, right? Well, I can’t say it’s exactly difficult, but dealing with people isn’t always a walk through the garden. My bosses make more money the more employees I get for the hotel’s operation, so I’m basically my bosses’ face at the hotel.

Anyways, Last year a huge group of my staffing decided to leave all of a sudden. I didn’t really mind losing them because this specific group of about 10 people weren’t the best at their work, usually called off and most of the times they came To work on a hangover. But they have no notice, no nothing. Just one day they didn’t show up again. When I called my bosses to explain what was happening they said “well it’s up to them, let them know that if they leave like this, they’re never coming back.” And so I did. They said they didn’t care, they had better options now.

So fast forward like 6 months to the present, I managed to form a solid team, and everyone’s getting ready for summer when work gets to it’s best season. Morale is up. These deserters that left abruptly last year now want to come back to which I replied “No, you all messed up thing big time last year and I warned you all this was going to happen”. I was confident my posses would back me up, I have a lot of people trying to get a job here waiting in line for a vacant, there’s no way they’re coming back. Right?

Well, wrong. These guys called my boss directly and told him they were back and they brought more people with them, so he could make more money. My boss called me and said “Do whatever you can to convince the hotel to accept them back” to which I replied “Look, they made me look like an idiot last year, the hotel manager yelled at me for all the trouble they caused last year and I just don’t feel comfortable having them back, also I have plenty of good people waiting for a chance to work, I’d rather give it to them”

He agreed with me that one time, but a couple days later he called me again to say “Look I know you don’t like them but I want them working ASAP.”

At this point i just wanna give up on this and let him handle things the way he wants. It’s a pretty good job and the pay is great, but this kind of bs is just too much for me.",1644508610.0

To All;
    It is with great pleasure that I tender my resignation today from ****** Enterprises and remove myself from the ranks of the ***** Windows and Doors sales team.  As an individual with over twenty five years experience in home improvement I am appalled at the lack of integrity of the brand and the gross inferiority of the product. The class action lawsuit only scratches the surface of the flaws throughout the catalog.
    The way this company from Iowa on down treats its sales team is a complete joke.  Sending out mailers with deep discounts that the commissioned salesman have to ‘eat’ from their commission or ‘negative discount’ is sham and lacks any form of integrity.  Demanding that we LIE to the homeowner about the class action lawsuit and tell them the suit only entitles them to a ‘25% discount’ (also chipped right from the salesmen’s commission) is a clear violation of the lawsuit guidelines.
       On a franchise level the owner B*** is a seven foot tall man child and a bully. Personally telling the Buffalo sales team that “he didn’t give a fuck about our kids, our family arrangements, or evening plans” and telling us we are HIS “six days a week, five nights a week and three Saturdays a month” was the clearest indicator I needed to see how much of a pile of heaping rosy cheeked shit he is.  Then came the buzz and talk throughout the company of the multiple lawsuits he is embroiled in, including sexual harassment and the fact that **** Corporate is planning on yanking the franchises out from under him due to them.  This is why the Buffalo sales team and countless others have departed since I joined the ranks. 
     This franchise has nearly a hundred people supposedly working in its offices to support the over all sales of the company.  Other than M*** H****, A**** W*****, G**** W****** and small handful of individuals  I have never felt I had support, only adversaries. G*** W****** did a great job training me on company products and options but had little she could educate me on with PQM.  
    I was sent to Iowa for two weeks where I was drilled with sales technique and how to ‘one call close’ but very little to no training on PQM or how to actually submit an order once it sold. I wasn’t educated on processing deposits or even explained that I would be the one processing them. With a supposed support staff of this size it makes little sense to saddle the 100% commission sales rep with bank related matters.  The list of incidences of ‘passing the buck’ are countless. The atmosphere of ‘cover your own ass and screw anyone else’ is systemic throughout the company.  Most are more concerned about not pissing B*** off or basking in the ego their little job title gives them than actually servicing the customer.
    Which brings me to two individuals particularly that I would like to address.  T*** S****** is mediocre salesman turned IT guy who lives by the mantra “Its not my job” and wants his little ‘service tickets’ that do nothing but satisfy his ego and delay the resolution of problems. His smug and arrogant attitude could be laughable if it weren’t so annoying…and he is a tattle tale.  
The worst sniveling petulant child in the company has to be J** “respect my authority” W*****. His petty and melodramatic behavior is also a joke. This is a man who will stop a job in its tracks over the most trivial detail. His only interest is to make a hundred keystrokes to point out a problem via email rather than making four to correct it. He is one of the root problems in this company in terms of customer service. He is widely known throughout the sales teams as a thorn. He cares very little about satisfying the customer; he only cares about satisfying his ego and not getting demerits from the ‘executive management’.
Am I perfect? Nope. I have made my share of mistakes and own them.  I have no doubt that I was set up to fail at this company simply by working with cut throats, tattle tales, buck passers and people who flat out have no interest in participating in a team atmosphere. To those who have treated me kindly I offer you the best of luck and bid you well

What I did discover is that they sell variety packs, which are one of the cheapest options, and when looking through the cupboards I find a ton of the less than desirable flavors IMO (proof below)

Now call me a conspiracy theorist but I think they are WANTING me too go through the overstock of other flavors before they order more. To save literal pennies vs ordering the one kind.

If it were not for the abusive and exploitative nature of the job, I would not post this question here! I think this may be the right place though.

I was fired in November from a daycare + preschool center where I taught very briefly.

It was a toxic work environment -- even our handbook said that we are required to work scheduled and unscheduled work without pay, must arrive 15 minutes prior to the start of one's day, must believe in God, must believe in the constitution, and must say the pledge of allegiance every day. Now, educators work for free ALL THE TIME, especially ones who really care about their job. It's sometimes something you accept as part of the job, especially with younger age groups. Hell, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some of the after-hours crafting I've done for my classrooms and students. This employer, though, absolutely pushed this beyond any acceptable limits. As hourly employees, we were not to be paid for conferences, meetings, events, etc. We could be talking 2-8 hours of additional work following regular work hours on any given day. As for God and the constitution, I'm not sure of the legality. But making preschoolers say the pledge? That's just a big ""no"" from me LOL

The owner of this center is like a classic MLM ""boss babe"" but extra scary. She dropped out of law school to focus in her business. Not sure how else to describe her. She always called me a ""Karen"" because as a worker I'm optimistic and friendly, I'm big on gratitude and communication. She had a major habit of ridiculing and pushing employees to quit and/or leaving threats to fire us if we displayed positive qualities that she did not. Threats usually took the form of very threateningly written letter reminding you that she can and will fire you for any reason or conduct she sees fit; she even announced in a staff meeting that she would do so even if she ""just wanted to."" We were reminded over possible wrong turn, mistake, or something she deemed threatening in demonstrating team-oriented behavior (as it was ""undermining"" and ""gaslighting"" her) that we are at-will employees. Anyway, she'd label and personally deliver the letter to your mailbox. Coworkers seem too comfortable/willing to talk to you? Letter. Too many appointments scheduled and TO requests? Letter. Unable to complete the inhuman amount of work she sprung on you last minute, in addition to the inhuman amount of work youare required to do daily? Letter. Voicing a workplace/safety/logistical concern? Letter. etc. etc. etc.

When she hired me, it was on the spot. She told me about her other staff and personal things like their divorces, etc. during the interview lmao. I was desperate so I accepted the position. She told me she was so relieved, as she had gone through 48 staff who had quit or been fired in matter of one year and can never find anyone ""normal"". This is a school with 6 teachers and 4-6 TAs on a typical day. Huge red flag. We didn't even have custodial staff. In the few months I worked there. about 4 were hired and quit. We took care of the custodial work and building maintenance, usually during nap time, after work, or literally whenever we could. If she saw so much as a scribble of crayon on a desk, it was a threatening letter and a meeting with the entire staff discussing YOUR error. So we spent a lot of time running around with magic erasers and spray bottles when we should have been engaging and teaching. My first staff meeting at this, in fact, was really her verbally attacking her employees while giving us slices of pizza -- insulting, telling us we should be grateful for all that she does for us. ""I had to take out a loan on my Mercedes to do payroll this week. And you think I do nothing for you."" like WHAT??!!! I don't own a car or know anything abt loans so I don't know what this means, but it sounds like a HER problem. She liked to name names during meetings, but she would also do a very dramatic stare whole saying things such as ""SOMEONE has been..."" or ""I was told SOMEONE said..."" or ""does SOMEONE have anything to say for themself?"" At that same fiest meeting she handed out worksheets and we had to calculate all of the expenses, etc. that she has to manage as a business owner. Then she said ""you should be thanking me.""

Anyway. One one particular day, I had more than I could handle. She was making her usual rounds and doing her usual thang and critiquing teachers and their classrooms. She happened to see a project I was working on with my students and was very upset that their handprint christmas trees made with paint were made with their hands facing up like this✋🏻 as opposed to the other direction, facing downwards. They would not make for good advertising as they were done ""incorrectly."" We were required to do about 6 complete projects daily and take 200 pics of each student per month for online advertising -- THAT was our curricum. Mind you, I was assisting e-prek infants and leading a class of 2-3 year olds. She told me to find time to scrub the acrylic paint off of the cookie jars, start over, and have them completed by dismissal that afternoon. This was the last straw for me lol. On my break, I told her I was overwhelmed and felt that I could never reach her ever-shifting expectations. I then ran a few minutes late, after running it buy her, on my break as I needed to stop crying before returning to work. She then told me she was disgusted and disappointed in me, and that I ""endangered the lives of the children."" I was fired and not welcome to retrieve my things. After some texts and emails between us, she told me not to contact her. her business, her employees, or her students' families, and that once I returned my key to the building, she would give me my final paycheck and my classroom materials. I taped her key to the door of the school and the next day received an email that my check and belongings were in the parking lot for me to pick up, which I did.

Not sure if this is all context, me venting, or both. 

Anyway, I worked there from Oct-December 2021 and I have not received my tax information from this employer. Normally one should contact an employer for this info or get it through a payroll service. She asked me not to contact her and she does her own payroll -- so what do? Is it appropriate to skip the reaching-out-to-her step? lol

I feel like noting that this is not a Christian school, there were many ways in which the program was unsafe as a result of the owner's policies and choices, and that the owner is from the same community of origin as me (lower income, small, and relatively diverse community in the county we are currently in) -- which led to a very weird, classist and somewhat racist disdain for anything ""ghetto"" in the work culture. It was weird. A lot of school faculty/administration can be a bit Karen-esque but this employer and her few loyal employees were over the top.",1644503142.0

I am a decade long hr middle management lady and for many reasons I love this group.

I see posts of two kinds here:

1. How to work the system with HR
2. How to politically as organized activists  systemically fight back

In terms of effectiveness I think it’s worth acknowledging and strategizing these two prongs. We are capable of doing so. I believe this.

I suggest:

Some system of dedicated Qs where HR middle management ppl like me and other labor professionals can respond with strategy to help the individual worker and I would be absolutely GLEEFUL to help beleaguered workers with advice from my perspective having now worked in HR for a long time (and most of my contributions here come from that perspective) and knowing how insurance works and how labor laws work. Dedicated professionals working to workers is desperately needed and I am here for that (we used to call those unions but that’s a decimated strategy so we need new language and reworked strategies)

AND Another system dedicated to organized big group activitism so that we can lay the bones for a true general strike which is historically super effective but we’ve been so tamed in America we don’t know how to do it anymore and we just fight over other (often extremely legitimate) things instead

I strategically want  my life’s work to be about bringing down this trash glorified feudal system. 

Please for real let’s do it.

I’m down. Let’s be clever and supportive of each other and remake this shit because it’s absolutely only getting worse and I say that as someone who works for nice billionaires and overhears their convos and they are actively preemptively strategizing how to repress workers more so it doesn’t hurt their 5 exotic vacations a year while the world is literally on fire and we HAVE TO fight back.",1644501490.0

My base pay is around $48k US and I get anywhere between 10%-15% as bonus on top. My monthly rent + food + utilities total to $650 US. My health insurance as well as life insurance is paid by the company (low payout but it's free and health insurance is only 10% copay). I have a mortgage for an apartment to be delivered next year, I currently pay just the interest on it ~ $400 US. Full mortgage with principal will be around $700 US when I move in next year, the rent I save will offset the extra burden. I don't have a wife or kids. Taxes after averaging for progressive levels, is around 25% after accounting for deductions. Inflation here is 8% officially, real inflation is probably close to 12%. Our version of 401K gets another $300 with both me and the employer contributing half.

All in, I spend about $1200 US including leisure spending like eating out, Netflix/Spotify/Amazon Prime. My internet is paid by my company ($15), I have a work laptop from the company and when offices reopen in this country, the company will provide commuting on its fleet of cabs as it has for the past 15 years I have been here. It's an industry standard where I live regardless of who I am employed with.

I can comfortably save $30k US per year and pay off my mortgage ($72k) in a couple of years easily. I also get around a month in PTO/sick/statutory holidays.

I was recently offered to apply for a similar role in our US offices (Phoenix). Dollar converted pay is better but so are the expenses I believe. They're offering around $90K annual before bonuses and deductions/taxes.

Should I be even considering such an offer? On paper the pay is much higher, but my expenses here are cents compared to what I have read in many of your posts. I am saving almost half of my pre tax earnings in my 3rd world corner of the planet... I doubt I would be able to save that even with the 2x wages I would get if I take the job.

Only when the rich and poor go through the same experience in terms of consuming basic things then only everyone will develop empathy.

When managers would spend atleast 50% time working in the same role as their reports then only they would understand the pain and effort.

When rich will live in the same amount of space and eat the same food as poor then only they would advocate for improving the basic necessities.

Apart from it people should be allowed/encouraged to splurge like go travel in first class of air travel but at the end of the day you will sleep in same room as everyone else and eat the same quality/quantity of food..

Because this would come up, only one and only variety of every food should be sold (by government) like everyone gets same quota of chicken and rice (same quality and same quantity) maybe for few things quantity cap can be removed (like rice) but rest all should remain the same.

We all had to get hired on with a new company or find new jobs. I and other employees suspected our checks were short for many reasons (worked OT but check was a normal one, worked Christmas but check was a normal week, was supposed to get a $500 bonus that also felt like a normal week) but had no way of verifying them. We have direct deposit, and the new company claimed they were “hacked” and could not access pay stubs. This lasted a month. The new app they got to replace that crashed before you could log in. 

So I filed a complaint with the DWD, citing Labor Standards. This whole time I’m emailing HR trying to get my pay stubs, but it’s an excuse every time. Two months I’ve been trying at this point. 

FINALLY, our useless HR person sent me a “history of pay” for 2021…only my rate of pay isn’t listed anywhere. I replied to her email pointing this out, to which she explained how to do the math. I know how to divide, I just don’t think I should. I have never seen or heard of a place that asks you to do your own math on pay stubs. Theres the issue with OT, Holiday, and this new company does things like “work 8 hours without a break, get one hour of straight time added to your wages”. 

Back to the DWD complaint. They got back to me yesterday, and forwarded the company’s response to me. The company forgot to mention their app and website were inaccessible/inoperable every time someone tried to use it. The DWD says I have until the 17th to say I’m satisfied and everything is fixed. 

I feel like my employer lied by not sharing that everything was down or crashing…for over a month. I’m also very hung up on the rate of pay thing…can I hit back and say I still don’t have the correct information listed on my pay stub? Is that even true of me to say? 

Do employers by law have to have specifics listed on your pay stub, like how much your making per hour?

I’m in Wisconsin if it matters.

I should’ve added this the first time: on the “history of pay” for 2021 it did list my total deductions for each pay period, but didn’t specifically list them. So it’ll say total deductions: $xxx but does NOT list how much of that was dental, LTD, 401k, etc. This is also weird to me as I’ve always seen it itemized.",1644499465.0

I live in India which is a ""3rd world country"" according to Western Media. People in India always dream about moving to the US and working there because we have an idea that there is no possible better life. A few of my friends who have emigrated have told me how everyone outside thinks India is an absolute shithole and no one would ever want to come here. 

Looking at all the bullshit you guys are facing absolutely flips that narrative. I currently have infinitely better working conditions than the average American. 

For reference:

1. I'm paid $28K base per year with covered insurance and pension (after currency conversion). Now this doesn't seem much but my living expenses are so ridiculously low - $320 per month rent and another $30-$40 in utilities. The company provides a laptop and allows work from home. If I'm needed to come into the office (Which happens \~5 days a month) Uber cost $1.50 one way so around $15 for transportation for the month and I spend around $130 on food for the entire month. 
2. I get 15 days Paid leave, 12 days of sick leave (Need a doctors note for 3 or more days consecutive), and 6 national holidays + 4 individual specific religious holidays (This is because India has millions of religions so people need to take different days off)

Granted with my Salary I would struggle in most places in the US but for when I am located I live comfortably.

Also, healthcare can't even be compared. I go for checkups for various things (General, dental etc) every 3-6 months because it costs barely anything. I'm 25 and fairly healthy without any co-morbidities so my out of pocket health expenditures are minimal. My father is a Type 1 diabetic and his insulin costs \~$75 per month. 

I had a dream to go to the USA for my masters and work there after. Now I'm really really considering otherwise. You guys need to fucking riot.",1644494178.0

Idk if this has happened to anywhere else but the AM unironicaly ran the store like a branch of the army: referred to himself as the ""commanding officer"" and ""first officer"" multiple times, demanded we referred to him as ""sir"" or ""captain"" (not a single person ever used that one), he wanted us to kinda stand at attention when he passes us or walked into the room, he renamed the things we did as part of our job as ""orders"" or ""commands"" or ""duties"", we had a briefing every shift change which left the entire store empty of staff meaning the store stood still for about 30 mins where he would throw his weight around (one briefing he called my shift ""soldiers"") and tell us how he has received ""orders"" from ""central command"" ( the GM) before then giving us our ""orders"" being moved to different sections was labelled ""redeployment"" and called the backrooms where the office was ""ground control"". He would spend what seemed like 50% of his time standing and berating us all for ""disobeying a DIRECT order"". 

Worst part was, a lot of staff went along with this - called him sir, did the stand to attention thing, didn't piss themselves laughing when he shouted at them. 

I have a ton of stories from this job if you want them but this is just an introduction to this guy.

For comparison, 50 pills of Ibuprofen 400mg (no prescription necessary) cost 5€ as well. You're covered anywhere inside the EU.

Edit: My employer pays the same amount as I do in taxes. So 50k before tax equal around 32k after tax (take home) and my employer actually pays 80k. If I don't have a job and am not qualified for unemployment pay (recently let go) however, the goverment pays everything and I am still insured and get the same medical attention.

sp4lyg,New commune initiative in Europe,5,0.7,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sp4lyg/new_commune_initiative_in_europe/,4,"We (a group of 7 currently) would like to create a commune somewhere in the southern Europe (Galicia looks like a good place). I suppose this initiative may be relevant for people here.

The commune is to be built on the following premise: recreating society based on the scientific method, principles commonly accepted in science and open debate in order to maximise fulfilment and wellbeing of a human life.

The above-mentioned premise is the only thing that commune members should agree with. Everything else is to be derived from the premise. However, a commune member should also be open-minded as decision making is based on respectful debates. So be ready to debate on the topics of egalitarianism, antinatalism, veganism, anticapitalism, environmentalism, etc.

The reason for wanting to make a shared value system based on the premise is that one of the reasons why communes fail seems to be heterogeneity in values. With the proposed method we expect to solve that issue because people tend to do things that they find to be right if there are no obstacles. The reason why we have many different stances on things is because people may think that their stance is correct or someone else's stance is wrong because they based it on a different premise, have different information or a fault in logic. We took into account those three.

The currently proposed government/economic model aims at reducing the amount of work we need to do, so seems relevant to the subreddit.

**Government/economic model**

No money or private property (to a sensible degree) in the commune. A non-profit organisation (NPO) with commune premise as its goal will be established that is going to own all assets and handle monetary interactions with the outside world. Commune members will be voting on all expenses that are going to be done by the NPO. The vote should be unanimous. If not, an open debate will be held until everyone agrees.

For-profit companies (FPCs) will be created in order to get money from the outside world. FPC should not require members to leave the community (or at least they must agree). The work that has to be done will be kept at minimum (no 40 hour work weeks). Members vote on what FPCs are established and how they operate. Example: a software development company (or some other remote work company), where commune members volunteer to do work. Instead of hiring workers, companies can hire our FPC (no need to pay social tax, multiple people instead of one).

Members are responsible for ensuring prosperity of the commune. Required jobs will be agreed upon together and posted for anyone to perform. Every member decides themselves how much they work and what they do.

By doing some calculations it seems that each member will have to work to earn money only for 8 h per week when all required assets are bought taking into account an equivalent of a median salary brought by each member.

He has 3 people that no one in the organization trusts because they're incompetent as the people he thinks are the most competent and trustworthy.  He follows that up by heavily implying that if I want further advancement in the company I need to be in his inner circle and I can achieve that by spending off work hours doing off work things with him.  I'm now looking for a new job.  FYI, I was in the quadrant that is competent but not ""trustworthy.""

Everything is going great, I'm learning a lot and the work isn't too bad. The hours are 9-5, so pretty standard.

I also share an office with one of the co-owners, just me and him, and we get along great.

However, this morning I was caught off guard.

I got into work at 9am and sat down at my desk for 9:01. 

5 minutes later, the employee that handles the payroll and whatnot comes into the office when I'm on my own and says ""Hiya, can you make sure you get in for 9am every morning"".

So I said ""Yeah that's fine, no worries"".

And then he said ""it's just because you were late this morning""

(Remember, I was sat at my desk at 9:01)

I honestly thought he was joking, so I gave him the laughed I thought he wanted.

He wasn't laughing... He was deadly serious.

So I looked at him and said ""Mate, I was on time. I got in at 9AM, say down at my desk for 9:01 and it's now 9:06, you can't really get more on time than that."".

Then he went on to say ""oh it's just (enter owner's name), likes to be structured.""

I gave him a concerned look and said ""yeah alright no worries"".

Then he left.

I don't know if this guy doesn't like me or something, but something doesn't seem right.

What would you do if you were me?

Like I said, I like the job and I don't want to lose it, so what's the best way to go about this?

During this time they have screwed me out of a good salary for so long with a promise that it'll improve in time, 2 potential redundancies which I successfully fought against and a non-existant work life balance.

Some of my colleagues have moved on to the other roles and are doing well for themselves while I'm still here. The workload has increased tenfold and the company is not offering any type of support even though I've been crying out for some help for a while now, their excuse is always ""it's good to be busy, think of the commission"" but I can't think of the commission when I can't even service every client properly. I'm so very behind it's not even funny.

I've asked for 2 pay rises and I've been shot down both times, even though I personally paid for exams to take on more responsibilities. The pay I'm getting is waaaay below industry standard. I feel like I'm being taken for ride.

I've just been offered another role with a slightly higher base salary, less responsibility and more support however it's very specialist compared to the open ended nature of my current role (which can potentially lead to other opportunities in future)

I'm about to have a meeting with the CEO to inform them of the offer. I'm the only one within the business with the qualifications required to complete 'regulated business' so I know he will offer me the same salary as I've been offered to stay, but I don't know if I should tell him to go fuck himself, he had his chance, or should I take the more pay and suck it up for a few more years.",1644487282.0

Edit: I don't want to post the video and its transcript because my contract includes a sort of confidentiality clause and I would have to take screenshots of our ""Wokrplace"" (facebook version for corporations).

Officially all CS employees (that is France, Germany, Spain, Lithuania, USA x2 , Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea) are having their contracts transferred to another company: Majorel.

We (Booking employees) have been working with them for some time and since about 1,5 year ago, regular employees job was mostly fixing what the outsourcing fucked up (not individuals fault, Booking denied them access to any of the internal resources).

The problem is, with the new company itself. The working conditions will be maintained for the first 6 months only. Afterwards they can do whatever they want with your contract and the only thing you can do is to resign which means: no severance pay, and (at least in my, French case) no unemployment benefits. Besides, many of my colleagues don't work at Booking by chance. The company used to have very high employment standards. The new company (Majorel) does not and they can assign you to work at CS of different companies each week. Today you work for DHL, tomorrow for Amazon. They can also tell you to move to a 'cheaper' country, cut your benefits and your salary by 70% to match the local minimum and that's it.

Beale: I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.

We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!

We all know things are bad -- worse than bad -- they're crazy.

It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, ""Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.""

Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.

I want you to get mad!

I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.

All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.

You've gotta say, ""I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!""

So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

This is a great sub, I've learned lots and appreciate everyones contribution! Hopefully mine fits the bill. 

I work for Uscellular. A regional cellphone carrier that competes (kind of) with Verizon att and TMobile where we have home service. 

I've worked here for 10 years. During that time i needed to meet a sales quota. The first couple of years it was only new line activations. Then a few years later it was that and an accesory quota. Then a year later they added a prepaid (pay as you go) activations quota. Fast forward to around dec 2020 they have now added the following metrics,
All metrics and quotas are monthly requirements 

Hyla (phone trade ins).                           17% of sales
HSI (CAPPED cellular home internet).  2 activations
Dp+ (phone insurance).                          70% of sales
BIR (new lines with a business).           2 activations
Plan mix (sell more expensive plan)    70% of sales 

Now don't get me wrong, as a sales associate I'll sell the products and services the company wants. It's my job after all but It is impossible to meet all of these metrics. i can hit my 3 core quotas but i cant hit 8 combined metrics it's impossible. It's not a will issue. Where i live our hsi is shit. Maybe in other regions it works better but not here. Here you can get unlimited internet with spectrum(cable internet) for 60$ my work Internet is $70 plus the monthly equipment fee and it slows down after 160GB! We take trade in phones for store credit. But who on gods green earth is going to sell their near perfect condition phone 12 for 250$???? Best buy offers 450$ !! The list goes on. 

We have been given warnings that if these metrics aren't met we will be held accountable. After 1 written warning theres 3 write ups. On the third one you are fired. So if in the next three months i dont sell 2 hsi each month i will be let go. Thats ridiculous. 

To make matters worse we are being micro managed. I've been selling for 10 years i dont need anyone to look over my shoulder and literally dictate what I say. I dont need someone pushing me to sell home internet to a customer that uses a flip phone and could give two shits about wifi in their house. 

My manager prints out emails that we all receive and makes us read them and sign that it was read. Then she asks if i understood the email. Thats absurd! Of course i understand it, i read the same email 30 minutes ago before you printed it!!! I once heard my manager tell my co worker that she couldn't go to the bathroom until she helped a customer that walked in 2 seconds after she got up and started walking. Management gets a hard on the moment someone walks in thinking we are going to sell them hundreds of dollars of service. We take lots of cash payments to the exact same people every month. Why would they buy new shit every month? When we can't close a phone insurance add on we are supposed to get the manager. What does she do when she cant close it either? ask the customer if they can add it anyway and credit the cost for 3 months!! That's shady as hell! 

Is there anything i can do or has anyone been through this before? 

TL:DR
The company i work for seems to have gotten money hungry and has set unrealistic sales metrics that when not met will result in termination. Management micromanages us and practice shady tactics.",1644478984.0

The night before my first day of leave, I notified everyone I thought I needed to notify. I informed everyone that I would have to travel and help with funeral arrangements and I wouldn’t know when I would return until after we set a date for the funeral. My hope was to take the week off using my three allotted bereavement days plus two sick days. However, I was also aware that there was a chance the funeral wouldn’t take place until the week after so everything was very up in the air. I let everyone know that I would be checking my email when I could in case anything urgent was needed from me. I was stupid enough to think that people would show some level of respect and restraint though and just email me for emergencies and reasonable requests. Boy was I wrong.

I wound up having to do a few hours of work on my first day of leave. I was willing to write that off though and move on but it didn’t stop there. Almost immediately after offering his condolences, someone asked me to let him know when I would be available that week to discuss something that honestly was not as pressing as he was making it out to be. By the second day of my leave he had asked me about this multiple times via email and IM and tried setting up a meeting. Keep in mind that this was all while I was in the midst of trying to help plan a funeral and I didn’t know yet what day it would be taking place. So I still didn’t know when I would return.

Multiple other colleagues who were aware of my leave and the reason behind it reached out with lists of high priority projects that should have been routed to someone else due to my leave. Technically, these people were not even supposed to come to me directly and were supposed to go through a project manager. Knowing I was out, they CC’ed someone else who should have been able to step up and help but he never said a word despite knowing the situation. This left me struggling to come up with a response and attempting to assess project requests while crying in my grandmother’s favorite chair. Assessing these requests is not even supposed to be part of my job. A PM is supposed to assess and filter everything.

This took up several hours until I gave up around 2am and went to bed. Because of the high demand for my attention, I could not afford to take off a third day and logged in early the next morning to once again try to make sense of the things being asked of me. Things did not go well. By noon I had barely accomplished anything and by 1pm I’d had a mental breakdown in the kitchen.

It was my old project managers who saved me when they noticed I was online and asked me what was going on. By the end of the work day they had met with everyone they needed to in order to clear my plate for the week so that I could have the time to process and grieve. This is all stuff that was supposed to be done by someone else but these two really stepped up for me.

Thanks to them, I’m able to take my third day of leave. With the funeral being next week, I was going to use two sick days but I’m now considering taking this to HR and asking for their permission to take two additional bereavement days since I had to work during the time that I originally requested off.

I’m trying really hard not to take any of this personally but I really feel like I was kicked while I was down by people who are supposed to be my teammates.

CV and Experience - on paper - not a top candidate so very nervous for future prospects and have always thought I’m current in a position that is good opportunity.

However, I am a competent, reliable and talented worker that’s been unhappy in my current company and position for some time. Beleiving it would be difficult short term to fill my varied role. With training and time competent people could do this role. I trained myself in role.

I’ve found this sub and it’s helped me order my thoughts and give me some kind of viewpoint and perspective for what is and isn’t ok from employers.

I work for a small firm in specialist home construction and have title of manager after working my way up from labourer position. 

The issues I’ve had besides being spoken to poorly, laughed at and ignored by management are-

-Consistent pay mistakes not being acknowledged and taking months to resolve

-Expectation to use own personal funds to buy site equipment (I stopped this after reading through anti work) sometimes topping $5000 with no time frame for repayment.

-No safety equipment or mechanical aids for lifting very heavy equipment.

-Everybody else within the company getting a pay rise.

-Being left to explain things to customers while simultaneously being told I shouldn’t speak to customers as I’m not delivering the message correctly - for context the  customers only point of contact is frequently me as I go to their properties to install and or fix things.

-Not being included in discussions of planning for site safety and the discussion of problems that have occurred with the product.

-Zero chance of furthering myself while at this company even though I’ve asked  and demonstrated I’m capable of offering more.

-Need to value your own capabilities and realise if you’re not getting on in a position then you have to move forward.

Finally, I quit.

What if you have an employer that is bitter that you left, they don't necessary have to give a bad referral but they can just refuse to answer anything. Also what if you are looking around for options, many employers will refuse to give out details on the job such as pay, or benefits without going through the whole hr process. So you would have to make your boss aware that you are looking at other opportunities which can leave your employer bitter. It also isn't easy to just fake stuff, some hr departments will investigate the shit out of your references, and they will become insanely intrusive.

sozuam,Hi. I'm an employment law attorney. I see plenty of illegal shit on this sub. I'd like y'all to know basic worker's rights. Let's start with a common one: Pay Secrecy. (With links to sources that you can print out for employers.),8553,0.99,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sozuam/hi_im_an_employment_law_attorney_i_see_plenty_of/,267,"First, a disclaimer: Yes, I am an attorney but I am not your attorney so NONE of this is legal advice. In fact, NOTHING I say on reddit will ever be legal advice. If you need an attorney please contact your state bar association for a referral. 

Pay Secrecy refers to the practice many employers use to prevent employees from talking about their wages. Employers cannot forbid employees from talking about their wages because this activity is [protected concerted activity](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/employees/concerted-activity) under the NLRA. Fun fact: Concerted Activity is the only right all employees have under the NLRA regardless of whether they are in a union. 

Any retaliation based on protected activity is also illegal and actionable. Retaliation is any adverse employment action such as a verbal warning, a written warning, a demotion, etc. 

You should always report illegal activity! ""If you don't use your rights, you lose them"" and this is especially true in employment law where there is usually a statute of limitations attached. 

Remember: report to federal agencies as well as state (ex: federal DOL and your state equivalent)

How to report illegal pay secrecy policies:

1. DOL - https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/complaints

2. NLRB - https://www.worker.gov/actions/nlrb-claim/ (This site gives an overview of how to file a complaint with the NLRB and links directly to their online form. It also has a lot of other useful information.)

Other Helpful Links:

1. DOL fact sheets - They have a few covering different subjects and all of them come in multiple languages. The one covering pay secrecy is second on [this list and is titled Pay Transparency](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/workers/fact-sheets). Print them off and hand them out or post them at work. 

2. NLRB website detailing Your Rights ([including Your Right to Discuss Wages](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights))

3. NLRB [Employee Rights Notice Poster Request](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-publications/publications/employee-rights-poster) - It details your rights as well as illegal conduct for your employer and your union. This also comes in many languages (28 to be exact). Another good one to print off to hand out or post. 

Once again, none of this is legal advice.

edit: This is all relevant information to workers (note: not just citizens) in the USA. I encourage people from other countries to post any relevant credible links to similar information. Solidarity!",1644474740.0

Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or the Act), employees have the right to communicate with other employees at their workplace about their wages.  Wages are a vital term and condition of employment, and discussions of wages are often preliminary to organizing or other actions for mutual aid or protection.  

If you are an employee covered by the Act, you may discuss wages in face-to-face conversations and written messages.  When using electronic communications, like social media, keep in mind that your employer may have policies against using their equipment.  However, policies that specifically prohibit the discussion of wages are unlawful.  

You may have discussions about wages when not at work, when you are on break, and even during work if employees are permitted to have other non-work conversations.  You have these rights whether or not you are represented by a union.

Protected conversations about wages may take on many forms, including having conversations about how much you and your colleagues and managers make, presenting joint requests concerning pay to your employer; organizing a union to raise your wages; approaching an outside union for help in bargaining with your employer over pay; and approaching the National Labor Relations Board for more information on your rights under the NLRA.  

In addition, you have the right to discuss and engage in outside activity with other employees concerning public issues that clearly may affect your wages – for example, minimum wage or right-to-work laws.   You may also discuss supporting employees who work elsewhere. 

You also have the right not to engage in conversations or communications about your wages.

When you and another employee have a conversation or communication about your pay, it is unlawful for your employer to punish or retaliate against you in any way for having that conversation.  It is also unlawful for your employer to interrogate you about the conversation, threaten you for having it, or put you under surveillance for such conversations.  Additionally, it is unlawful for the employer to have a work rule, policy, or hiring agreement that prohibits employees from discussing their wages with each other or that requires you to get the employer’s permission to have such discussions.  If your employer does any of these things, a charge may be filed against the employer with the NLRB. 

If you have any questions about your rights under the National Labor Relations Act, please call us at 1-844-762-6572.",1644474182.0

 The person who ate at the dinner that was all for them ended up cleaning it too!

We stayed to clean and help our supervisor, then was rewarded with a what's ultimately a bite size brownie. It's wasn't much cleaning but it was a slap in the face.

It is frowned upon/not acceptable to have coworker relations but we transferred here from another state so it was fine for us as long as we're seperated.


At my husbands new location, he needs to communicate information to the General Manager(f) if anything goes wrong during the night shift. Anything missing, extra stuff, etc. Its never been an issue at any place we've been but the General Manager here is acting extremely unprofessional to the point where it's pissing him off every day and he goes home upset. The GM ignores what he says, doesnt respond to questions, and when she does its in a sour tone. I've experienced this first-hand. We've been told shes ""not a morning person"" but if part of the job is communicating what the GM needs to know to operate the store that day, she should probably be paying attention to what we have to say. 


At first I thought we could just deal with it, but we got some gossip from another manager that the GM has been sleeping with one of the store employees and is scheduling them together exclusively. Not only that but she has allegedly taken pay-outs to buy the two of them food, stealing ""more than a thousand"" of the companys money. Another employee said the GM has been leaving before rush hour, so the employees have to fend for themselves. Not a cool thing to do to a crew who are already stretched thin as it is. 


To top it off, I'm pretty sure she is treating us like crap because she thinks we're new, when really we've been with the company for 3 years as consistant and reliable employees. I take my work pretty seriously and am respected for it at my store, so it makes me sad and angry to see my husband be treated like this 5/6 days out of the week. 


I dont know if I should try and put in an anonymous tip to do an investigation on the store, to check for missing money. The company I work for has a reputation of shuffling investigations under the rug when it comes to franchises, and I dont want retaliation for my husband and I. Do I drop this and just try to ignore the GM or should I take it further? Any serious answers are appreciated but jokes would help too honestly.",1644473542.0

I have been here since the store opened. I've got a good rapport with the employees. We stay out of each other's way, and there have been very few issues. I generally write my own schedule, and part of my job description is that I'm supposed to act independently and adjust the order of tasks as needed. One of the interesting things about my job is that each task has an ""estimated completion time"". So I might have a 4 hour, two 2 hour tasks, and a couple 1 hours in a given shift (I work 10 hour days by choice). 

I'm lazy. I don't believe in working hard, I believe in working smart. I was very clear about this when I interviewed. I look for ways to make my job easier and more efficient. As a result of this, my store has one of the highest on-time completion rate. 
But here's the secret. If a task is supposed to take 4 hours, and I finish it in 2, I take the next 2 hours to mess around (my Switch sees a lot of use). It's not like the store or my company loses money, they've already agreed on the rate/time. And I see no reason to push myself beyond the scope of my assigned tasks. I'm not looking for a promotion (I'm finishing college and have ZERO interest in moving up in the company), so being an ""exceptional worker"" has no value to me. I do what I'm contracted to do, no more, no less.

My previous manager got moved to a store closer to home, which is great for them. Im genuinely happy for them. The new manager sent out an email this week that basically read ""I'm going to write the schedule. You WILL follow it. If a task takes less time than projected, I expect you to accurately report it."" There was more, but thats the pertinent bits.

So, okay. Guess what? No task is ever going to be finished early. All you've managed to accomplish is make me dissatisfied with you as a manager. I cannot comprehend why managers think insisting on thus sort of thing is ever going to have a positive effect...
Also, I'm not going to tell you that your schedule is doomed to fail, as you've failed to account for certain store conditions. Store conditions I could have informed you about had you consulted with me instead assuming you know best. You'll have no one to blame but yourself when things don't work out. I'm sure you'll try to blame me, but that won't work. My record shows that I do just fine on my own.

It's going to be an interesting week...

TLDR: New boss is a micromanager. Now instead of being innovative, I'm going to make sure every task takes exactly as long as it's booked for.",1644470022.0
soyd7t,Am I going crazy? Crazy Boss (Recently Licensed Attorney Horror Story),6,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/soyd7t/am_i_going_crazy_crazy_boss_recently_licensed/,14,"Graduated law school last year.  Got a job as a law clerk after I took the bar exam in August with a part time professor I had at his firm doing a mix of criminal and civil and family cases.  Started off great, he was very supportive and friendly and complimented me a lot and said I was doing great.  Even said he wanted to train me to take over the firm in 10 years.  Said that after I pass the bar I'll get the associate attorney job.  I find out I passed the bar in mid November, and I get business cards with associate attorney on them, and boss tells me he's got an offer letter coming my way.  December comes and still no letter, ask him about it, says he will get to it after this big criminal trial he's doing.  All this time I'm not hearing anything negative about my performance.  Getting no real help from boss or only other attorney, they have me doing cases that involve areas of law and topics they've never even touched before and I have to figure it all out.  End of the year no offer letter.  Not hearing any negative critiques.  

Ask again in January about the offer letter, says he'll get to it next week.  Beginning of February, still no offer letter.  Nothing has changed, still no negative critiques or anything aside from a mention to remember to save the research supporting my citations in a research folder.  All this time I've been working more than 8 hours a day every day, some days working between 12-15 hours.  I don't get any overtime.  Just get paid for the 8 hours a day.  He charges the client $185 for an hour of my time and I only see $34 an hour.  It's a new firm with only me and two other attorneys (including boss) and our secretary. 

This week our secretary has been out and he asked me to handle the phone.  Earlier this week, Tuesday, boss gets pissy with me about a document I prepared (an Answer to a Complaint).  Asks me why I included some defenses.  I explain that I've done like 6 of these since working there and I've done what he's complaining about each time I've written these and have never gotten feedback to not do that.  He even had me look up a few weeks ago about whether there's a problem with pleading a bunch of affirmative defenses, and I explained based on research that there's no real downside and he said okay and we submitted the Answer.  Now, all of a sudden he's pissed about it for some reason.  I say it won't happen again and I'll make sure it's done the way he wants it.  He also goes on a rant about: 

1. I emailed a client last week based on him telling me to email her, during a meeting two weeks ago, after receiving a letter we were waiting for.  So I emailed her and he immediately emails me saying why did you email her? I wrote back I emailed her based on our conversation where you asked me to email her.  So he brings this up yesterday, Tuesday, and says I would have never told you to email her, and says it keeps him up at night that I did.  

2. Including short memos with my Answers to complaints so he can see how I'm coming up with the defenses, and saying that I never do that.  He's never asked for this before, I always file a memo with all my research and analysis in our folder, but they're typically more than a few pages because of how in depth I get.

3. Giving him an update about a conversation we had on Monday about a client.  Says don't work on stuff I don't tell you to do, all while I simply noticed an email from the client from last week that changed part of my analysis and wanted to update him because I felt it was important to the client and our success on the case.  

4. Says I spend too much time on tasks.  Has never brought this up ever before.  As mentioned above, he has me working on complicated property, contracts, etc. cases that the two attorneys there know nothing about.  It takes time for me to research and learn, and I ALWAYS get my work done and submitted before it's due.  Couldn't ask for more information about this or comment on 95% of what was said because he was talking the whole time and then said I need to go to a meeting and left. 

5. Ranting about how he has to cut the time I'm billing to clients and that he's having to cut so much that it's effecting his bottom line.  He has never brought this up before.  I try to ask him about this and what he's cutting and how I should be doing it differently and he tells me to look at the bills and my logged hours, compare them and figure it out. 

Fast forward to today.  We meet.  He asks me what my career goals are and what areas of law I don't like working on.  I say I'm interested in criminal defense and that I was hoping to do more of those cases.  He starts talking about how I should go find a public defender job, very clearly suggesting he wants me to leave essentially.  Says he wants to give me a good reference but he can't ""misrepresent"" me and essentially says that depending on how I perform in the coming weeks I would either get a bad review or a good one. 

He then starts ranting about how I submitted another Answer with too many affirmative defenses last night.  Yesterday, I spoke with the other attorney at the firm, who is overseeing the case I submitted the Answer for, and explained boss's criticisms with my complaints, and said I'd like to make some changes to.  I asked him if he reviewed it and what he thinks about the defenses in there.  He says to keep them all.  I explained to my boss today while he was ranting about it that I had that conversation with the other attorney (same age as boss and same experience) and he told me to keep all the defenses.  Boss starts practically yelling now that I needed to tell the other attorney that he was wrong and that I should have convinced him to let me make the changes, even though he's the main attorney on the case and said to keep them.  After yelling some more about how I'm making his life difficult he says something along the lines of: I'm going to replace you as soon as I find someone. 

A few hours after this conversation he comes to my office and starts shooting the shit and makes some jokes about going to teach the class he teaches at the law school.  Boss is oblivious.  Thinks we're pals still after that.  

Now I need to find a new job.  All while my medical bills are killing me because of our shitty insurance (I have some medical problems).  Feels really shitty.  I feel like I did everything right for the firm and worked my ass off every single day and worked way over the hours I was paid for.  Now I feel betrayed and like a fool.  Wish me luck on the job hunt while I stare at a wall tonight trying to make sense of this.  Bay Area, California.",1644469897.0

The assistant manager wanted me to work off the clock for this customer. I refused. The customer was following me screaming at me. I asked repeatedly for the manager to stop her following me and diffuse the situation.  After about 15 feet of her following me screaming in my ears I finally turned and screamed at her.
Afterwards I spoke with the store manager, who is actually great and is the kind of manager that makes you want to work and do your best, about the situation for about 30 minutes.  He chose not to do more than give me a verbal warning, and said he was going to speak to the assistant manager.

This also isn't the first situation I've had with this assistant manager. His first day, he called me a disrespectful little girl, and young lady. Thursday he threatened to fire me for saying  ""yeah?"" When he hollered my name from 10 ft away instead of ""yes sir?"". Friday he threatened to fire me because a customer had to wait 6 minutes  while someone brought me a helium tank up.



So. Sunday, while the store manager is off, 2 hours in to my shift he calls me to the office.  He tries to suspend me for the entire week. Despite the fact that I don't have even a write up or written warning on file. He refuses to let me have a union witness. He says some really fucked up shit including that I'm replaceable  and unnessicary  to the store and everyone.

Monday morning the store manager called me FREAKING out.  He tells me he's gotten the  DM involved and this sham of a suspension is canceled, write up is thrown out,  and that he's so sorry i had to deal with all that and to come on in.

Everyone is coming to me telling me what happened after I left Sunday, that he was speaking about me loudly with other associates, spoke about me on he phone with someone, and then immediately changed hi story to that I was actually really stealing and he suspended  me as a favor going easy on me.

He's off Monday and Tuesday.  So today, Wednesday,  he comes in at noon as in getting ready to head out.  He and the deli manager stop in front of my desk. He asks her ""do you think (my name) just doesn't know  what suspended means? You know she's a high school drop out right?  In her file it says she got her ged in (year I would've started junior year)""",1644469452.0
soy6ld,Boss denying my schedule alteration for no reason,3,0.67,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/soy6ld/boss_denying_my_schedule_alteration_for_no_reason/,8,"Where I work, we have limited Saturday hours and work a partial crew. There is a schedule posted and the supervisor assigns the work schedule based on pretty much her own whim. It varies how often in advance this schedule is done up ahead of time, usually several months.

The rule has always been that you can switch Saturdays with another coworker if you need off, so long as you have coverage. I can't ask off, but I can compromise with a coworker and swap.

I need next Saturday off. It doesn't have to do with the weekend, but the people I'm scheduled to work with (same supervisor is a raging bully, and she ropes in her favorite subordinate to help - both of whom make my life a living hell). I didn't want to make waves, so I elected to switch instead.

Today I get a text saying that I'm not allowed to make that change and that I'll have to work as originally scheduled. I was given no reason as to this change. If my supervisor were normal, I'd ask for a reason why. But any time I've tried to talk to her in the past, I get a round of parroted responses and make no progress. I have worked here nearly 3 years and no one has ever been denied a Saturday switch before.

I talked to her boss earlier this week about this issue, and she suggested moving it up the chain to the business owner. That's precisely what I plan on doing tomorrow during my shift. Before anyone asks, I also plan to leave in the near future but for financial and insurance reasons I need a job to go to before I can break ties. I also need to be able to go to work in a non-hostile environment.

Anyone have any tips, ideas, suggestions, or comments?",1644469310.0

I am currently on disability for mental issues, and they don’t give me much at all to live, so I figured I would try to work an under the table job to try to make a little extra, to survive, and keep my insurance so I could stay in therapy. I got lucky because an old acquaintance/friend of mine, has a family partaking in running a business, and I Had worked for them before. 

When I started things seemed to be going well. I had laid out how much I can work because of my disability and number of appointments, and everyone seemed understanding, first two weeks flew by. 

Week three my friend says she’ll be going on vacation to Florida with her step brother, and is leaving her sister, who was supposed to be “supervisor” in charge to work with us. Making 4 of us left behind. 

Not even the first day she’s gone, her sister calls out without warning, leaving us without work. day two she informs us she’s in the hospital, and leaves the three of us behind, and the biggest jerk of a person in charge. Immediately, there are issues, the two others that are left are a mother and son, both drug addicts, whom actively showed up to work, visibly altered, one coked out, sometimes, others sluggish, we’ll call him Kyle, and his mom, nodding off standing up constantly, we’ll call her Jane. 

Kyle shows up to pick me up for work one day, and is swerving on the roads, Almost driving us into a guard rail twice. This was the first offense I tried telling my friend about in Florida. She asked me to hold out until she got back. 

The following days, they are asking me to come in more, because the sister is still out, leaving just the two of them and me, come to find out, she’s in the hospital because she smoked weed again, after knowing she has allergic reactions to it. I show up, and called off a few appointments, to try to help out but explain I can’t miss too many or I will be charged out of pocket.

 It started out at 9hrs a day, but soon progressed into 14 hour days, as the two of them were slow, one nodding out most of the time. we were cleaning 4-5 sites in the morning and 6-7 sites at night. I started getting burnt out, and was passing out from having only 2 hrs of sleep and one 1 hr break, and feeling nauseous. I had to call out, one day. I woke up to to texts from Kyle bullying me, and blaming me for leaving him and his mother on their own to do so many sites. 

I apologized, but expressed frustration, as the “supervisor” was still missing on the start of week two, and was supposed to be not only running the business, but covering for me during my appointments. In the following days I dealt with an insane amount of verbal abuse from Kyle, criticizing everything I did, coming into places I was cleaning and taking cleaning supplies from me and “doing it for me better” and going over things I’d already cleaned to near spotless conditions saying I trashed them, and I need to be paying more attention, because I missed a literal finger print. 

Today I show up after another long day with no sleep, and make it through the whole day and half the night, when our occasional night guy, james, shows up. Jane walks up to me and tells me to put my mask on when he came inside, but wouldn’t tell me why. (I don’t usually wear it when I’m alone on the opposite side of the building.) 

I nervously, but jokingly walked up to James after I found him coughing up a storm, with his mask half hanging off and said “what do you have Covid?” And he said that he did. I started freaking out because I have people in my life who aren’t vaccinated, (I am) and a young step son. I nervously started keeping my distance, and questioning to myself if I should leave knowing the belittling I would get if I did. 

Kyle walks up to me, and says all Agro, “if you’re uncomfortable you can leave” so I ask, if I do, if he’ll be pissed, and he passive-aggressively responded essentially implying he would tell the boss I bailed again and I might lose my job because I left them to struggle. I flipped my top at this point after so much of his bullying. And I stormed out and left. 

My friend/other supervisor is asking me to come into work tomorrow night, or Friday, when she’s back and I literally want to tell her to fuck off. I messaged her as politely as I could telling her I was done with kyles bullying, and that if it didn’t stop I was done, and that I draw the line at Covid.. 

None of this feels ethical, but I feel trapped because I can’t afford my life without this job.

Unfortunately, I contracted  Covid last month and had to be out of the office. On January 19 I got tested and it turned out positive so I followed protocol and let my boss know.  They sent it up the chain and because I started showing symptoms on January 16 they did the 5 day quarantine rule from the day symptoms started vs when I was diagnosed and informed me that I was to report to work on January 24.

My son also goes to the same school district I work in and he also had Covid. (lucky us) However for the kids the quarantine time is longer and they mandated he stay home until January 27.  As you can already tell this makes absolutely no sense. Any who my boss was like you can use Covid leave for the 20 and 21 but for the other days that you have to be out you will need to use your own leave. 

I was super pissed because the school basically has staff and students on completely different quarantine schedules.  Keep in mind, I am a new district employee so I don't have tons of time built up, so I was like I'll just take unpaid time for my days out.

Every since this incident, my boss has been acting pissy at me. I mean it is not my fault the district administrators have a shitty covid policy, I mean what do they expect, for me to leave my kid at home alone  or blow through what little leave I have accrued.

I recently began an office job on the west coast.  I quit after 3 days.  Why?  Hear me out and let me know if I was being unreasonable.  

Day 1: On the first day, I showed up on the front door.  I had to call my manager as no one was at the front desk.  My manager kicked the door open (lifted his foot and pushed the door open toward me with his foot).  This was the second time ever meeting him (first was during an in person interview pre-Omicron).  

Anyway, later I am taken to ""my office"" which was a nice size office, but was full of shit.  There were 3 coffee mugs with caked/dry coffee on the bottom.  An open container of oats, a gallon of water, other odds and ends.  Anyway, the whole office was dusty and there were dead flies all around the inside perimeter.  I was left in my office so I started cleaning it.  As I'm cleaning, I am thinking to myself ""Gee, they could have asked the custodian to clear this out or at least have it swept and mopped"".  

Toward the end of day one my manager asks ""Did you get started on reviewing those reports""?  I answered with ""I haven't had a chance, I have so much 'administrative' work"".  

I inquired about COVID-19 protocols and I was told to just wear a surgical or N-95 mask.  A quick one sentence response.  

Day 2:  I am summoned up to his office where I am told my shift starts at 6:30am and ends at 4:30pm.   I was never asked how that would work with my schedule or what my family situation is.  It wasn't a discussion, I was told (this is for a salaried position).  The day went on, and I spent most of it cleaning my office and on Teams meetings.  Toward the end of the day, my boss drives in to the office and sends me a message to ""come upstairs"" when he gets in.  I go up and when I get there the person he wanted to introduce me to has already gone home.  I asked about their policy for working from home.  He basically said in one sentence ""if you can do your job from home, you do it from home"".  I was expecting either a written policy or program or something more formal.  

Day 3:  More teams meetings from 9am to lunch.  After lunch, I was messaged on teams to ""come upstairs to meet so and so"".  I'm ok with meeting people, but set a time and date.  We all have calendars.  I hike up to his office and let him know that another manager was introducing himself because he saw my door open and walked in because I was about 20 minutes late after his message.  Anyway, we walk over to the bosses office and we spend about 1/2 hour talking about what I'm supposed to do.  They discuss my start time again as if I wasn't in the room.  Before leaving, I got a chance to talk to the admin assistant alone.  She began telling me that the whole building went WFH due to an outbreak of 40 cases (the offices only house about 50 people).  The outbreak had happened 1 1/2 weeks prior to my first day.    

Day 4:  I wake up at 4am.  Think about what I am doing and decide to send a short email saying the job was not a good fit.  

Does this sound like I overreacted?  I felt like I wasn't being seen as an equal and the whole COVID pandemic was getting played down by my direct manager.",1644466580.0

I am only 20 years old and I am not having kids. But with this I realize what is the point of living, if we are essentially just working to survive as well? Why work towards our financial freedom just to get thrown out of society with a whole bunch of money, but as an old geezer with barely any life left? Why is the education system so useless and doesn't teach anything of actual value to society like money management, relationships, taxes, debts, loans and other important stuff? I would care about school if they actually made about 95% of it actually useful. 



 Why are we indoctrinated since birth to always play by the rules as a kind person, respect our elders and to always put society above ourselves only to realize it isn't going to matter regardless? I feel like I am sane and that the whole world is insane, accepting this shitty working cycle and putting that strain and irritation on future generations to deal with for *""LeGaCy""* purposes. I can't believe I have to do half a century of this shit before I croak. My job pays less than $15 an hour and my mother charges me $100 a month just for living with her and I am a college student as well. 




It's all a recipe for disaster and I am tired of it. I wish jobs would pay better. I wish they would recognize the fact that none of us asked to be here to deal with life and that they are willing to make exceptions. I wish Universal Basic Income was normalized so that we can guarantee our financial security to put aside slave labor in favor of following our true passions in life instead of working our lives away just to pass away with nothing to show for it.

&#x200B;

I work for a local funeral home and we recently got bought out by a corporation, the owners were just tired of running the business, wanted out, kids didn't want to take over, so had no choice to sell. one day we had a meeting and I honestly thought we fu\*\*ed up somehow and just didn't know, we went into the chapel and all of a sudden were informed of the takeover by our new corporate overlords. at first everything seemed fine, but more and more of their corporate goons lurking around like occupied france and keep showing up, things have been feeling different and the incentives we've been getting for 1. first call removals after hours, 2. holiday bonuses and other small incentives are out the door because they aren't ""compliant with labor laws"" which I can guarantee you is grade A sneaky corporate bulls\*\*it for they don't want to pay overtime. now the ones who were there for 10 years plus and since the funeral home started have left because the new regime didn't want to prorate their tenure or vacation time (surprise surprise) and now are just unloading all the responsibility on the rest of us of course with no new incentives. I can't stand it anymore I'm honestly one foot out the door and can't take it anymore, I came to this place to get away from the corporate big business b/s and somehow followed me there.

&#x200B;

this is the problem with the funeral industry, once nice kind, humble family/single location owned funeral homes are slowly being acquisitioned by big corporate giants and are just smearing their corporate feces, upping prices, funneling all the workload on care centers and embalming facilities and making funeral directors nothing more than used car salesmen with state issued licenses. it just sickens me that we have to work so hard, for a profession that's so demanding and yet watching what made it good slowly being snuffed away. I almost want to call it quits completely for the funeral industry all together but I really do enjoy embalming and restorative arts.",1644465232.0
sowtbw,Knowing my worth,7,0.9,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sowtbw/knowing_my_worth/,3,"I had worked for a law firm for over a year. I started off as a file clerk and helped other co-workers around the office in the beginning. Because of my journalism background, they assigned me to talk to every client to get their narrative about what they had gone through in their experience in wildfires. I really did love this job. I was helping their clients cope with the loss they had experienced in wildfires.  I worked overtime and tried to show that I was a hard worker, that I was capable to handle any assignment that my boss gave me. Eventually, I was promoted and was told by my boss that he wanted to extend my employment longer than we had agreed. 

A year into being employed my boss retired and had his daughter take slowly take over. We got along just fine (as a boss and employee should) and I had no issues with the transition. I continued working, taking in new assignments under deadlines all the time. 

Finally, after working there for over a year, the necessary work that needed to be met was completely finished. All of us that had been working so hard to get this work done finally got to celebrate and relax a bit. 

The next day, I received an email from the daughter's secretary that my time with them was coming to an end effective immediately. To say that I was angry and upset is an understatement. I couldn't believe that I was being let go, let alone in the form of an email instead of over a phone call or in person.

Fast forward a few months later, I got a phone call from her asking if I would be willing to come back. 

My response effectively was ""I would love to come back, but I have to say, the way you handled letting me go in an email was disappointing. If I do come back I'd prefer you tell me straight on instead""

It's small but I learned that you need to know your worth in the workplace. Standing up for myself in that way made me feel so much better at the end of the day. I know that what I've experienced is nothing compared to what I've seen on this sub. I was lucky in this situation to have a decent boss that listened and understood my issues.

I think everyone here does want to work including myself, but people want to get paid a living wage. Restructuring the name to something positive such as ""pro worker"" would be taken much more seriously by the public. Once you gain the eye of the public, telling the stories to them will come naturally. We tell each other stories on here and it is great to brainstorm, but those ideas need to catch on to the cashier at a 7-Eleven in the Bronx. They need to catch on to a retail clothing worker in Central Florida. They need to catch on to agricultural workers in the central valley of California.

There seems to be some organization within this subreddit, but not enough to start a real movement. A real one needs to start with a positive mission statement. If everyone thinks we are just lying around and desire a work-free life, no one's going to take us seriously. Perception is everything.

sowpc7,Oh how the turn tables,14,0.86,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sowpc7/oh_how_the_turn_tables/,3,"When I was finishing up college, I got a graveyard shift waitressing job at a casino to support myself. I let my boss know up front when she hired me that I was a student first, and as long as she respected my availability I would work the hardest-to-cover shift every day that I came in. It was good money, and I did exactly as I said I would. I even picked up holidays for other employees cuz I wanted that sweet sweet holiday pay, the tips were amazing, and it's not like I had school on the holidays.
   
  
  
After about a year of this, it became apparent that my boss was sort of a bitch as well as a big time power tripper. She tried pulling some bullshit like demanding we all show up to meetings with <48 hours notice (typical ""this could have been an email"" stuff). A couple times these meetings even interfered with my school schedule, but I did my best to make it work. Well, eventually she did this and it directly interfered with my plans to view an apartment with my partner at the time, not only that but I ended up getting her notification less than 24 hours before the meeting because I worked graves and went to school full time and therefore didn't constantly check my email every hour. I politely let her know I couldn't make it because I had a preexisting commitment and I didn't have enough time to reschedule it, then I simply didn't go to the meeting.
   
  
Two days passed and I got called into her office. She called me a liar for saying I got the message at the last minute, and then she told me I needed to come to work when I was supposed to be there. I respectfully informed her that I wasn't lying, and reminded her that I had other real life obligations and couldn't put everything on hold for last minute meetings at a job I'm only working to put myself through college. Shocker, she didn't like that. She also wasn't used to it since most of her employees were immigrants and depended on their jobs to keep their visas. She couldn't push me around the same way. She developed a vendetta against me. 
  
  
Months went by, and I dealt with a lot of toxicity and verbal abuse. Finally my last semester of school rolled around, and I let her know about the changes to my class schedule. Over time she'd made it harder and harder to adjust to this. At first, all I'd had to do was tell her my schedule. Then she wanted a printout of my schedule the following semester. This time around she wanted an official schedule from the registrar. I sent her an unofficial copy of my transcript instead, because I didn't want to drive all the way to my campus before I had to. She did not like this. She chewed me out. 
   
  
Around this time I had split up with the person I had moved in with, and had started dating a man who worked surveillance at the same casino I was working at (that man is now my fiancee). She also hated him for many of the same reasons; he respected himself, wouldn't be bullied, and didn't kiss her ass. We were pretty open about our relationship, and even greeted her together at the company Christmas party. Apparently it took her and her lickspittles a good long while to figure out what we were flaunting for all to see, but when she did figure it out she fired him for fraternizing despite there being no policy in place to prohibit it.
  
  
I did not like this.
  
  
She also decided to stop respecting my school schedule, and notified me of this by calling another ridiculous meeting in which she publicly shamed me for being lazy, sitting down and talking to other coworkers (at this point I had stopped sitting or chatting with anyone any time I wasn't on break despite others being permitted to do so because she had already been accusing me of these things), and then informed everyone that we were all replaceable and she didn't care if we were students, had kids, or were trying to partially retire;  we had to come in to work what we were scheduled for. She said she just didn't understand why no one wanted to work. She also took the time to put me on blast in a meeting with surveillance saying that I was trying to manipulate my now fiancee into helping me steal from the casino, and that I was using him. 
  
  
So when she posted my schedule for the week I started classes, and none of my coworkers picked up the one graveyard shift I couldn't work, I simply worked until the day before classes started, then dropped off my badge and letter of resignation, played one hand of blackjack (I'd never gambled there before), tipped my dealer a fattie, and left forever. On my way out a coworker who had refused to pick the shift up for me begged me to stay, but I just shrugged and said that I'd already dropped my card, and that kind of help would have been a lot more usefull a week prior. I heard from those who still worked there that the boss went full nuclear when she found out I'd quit, and started getting very paranoid that others would do the same without notice to the point that she actually fired an army reservist before he could quit. It still warms my cockles to think of how many rent free hours I lived in her head. Shortly after this, they had to stop offering service after 11pm because i was gone, other unhappy employees left as well, and then the pandemic forced them to close. They have since reopened in a new location.
  
  
I fully plan on sending her an RSVP to our wedding, except the only checkbox on her card will be;
  
  
✔NO
  
  
TlDr; boss was rude, disrespectful, expected me to prioritize my waitressing gig over my academics, fired my boyfriend and told everyone I was using him, and told me I was lazy and replaceable. Then when I quit without notice to prioritize my academics it mentally fucked her up and majorly interfered with the functioning of the business.

I’m a tech worker in my 20s and fully support the anti-work movement and proud be a part of it. My partner and I have regular conversations about stuff happening in this sub and recently we had a rather interesting train of thought. 

We were talking about what an ideal income structure should look like and wondering if gig type jobs like waiting tables, driving cabs, delivering food etc. were designed to be part time activities that you can do for extra money but they are not designed to be full time jobs that can help you fully support yourself/family. Agreed that companies like Uber exploit labor and something should be done about that. But going back to the original argument, how would the society change if all jobs no matter the skills/industry pay a livable wage with which you can fully support yourself? 

For example, imagine you’re a waiter who’s being paid fully livable wages, that means wages of other professions would also increase considerably. (People would have less incentive to learn different skills : tech, healthcare, anything really. So the companies will start paying more and more.) Would that make things better in the society or would that just inflate the prices even more and the “livable wage” increases and we’re back to square one?

I brought this issue up with my manager, who up until recently I had a good amount of respect for. I was told that after being a technician for 1 year, this amount of work is expected. Again, I have only been doing this for a little more than 7 months. This is also paired with him weaponizing jobs that I struggled on, or did a poor job on. He throws these jobs that I struggled on in my face and saying that I need to do better. I even have told him that I don't feel comfortable working in the dark because we are given nothing for lighting, and I am told I just need to figure it out.

""Please note - there will only be time slots available for the month of February. If the times presented do not work for your schedule, please feel free to email me directly and we can work out a different time.""

*** Quick back story; I'm currently a stay at home dad of 7 years to two special needs kids that are school aged. Wife wants to switch roles. I've been building websites for 18 years on and off, but more consistently in the past 10 years. I have formal education, on the job training, self learning projects, agency experience, and had my own agency as a one-man show. I do all things WordPress from custom themes and plugins to just basic stuff. ***

The dates and times available in the week of the February 1st and 7th were too early for me as I was just waking up or getting the kids ready for school, or in the afternoon when my wife was working or I had to pick up the kids. And there weren't many options to choose from. The earliest I could do was February 15th at 9:30CST. (They were 1 hour ahead of me.)

Today, February 9th, I received an email that said:

""""Hi ME, Thank you for applying to the lead WordPress Developer position with EMPLOYER. At this time, we have chosen to go with a different candidate. Thank you for your time, and we wish you the best in all you do! Thank you, EMPLOYEE""

Huh...okay. So I reply:

""Hi EMPLOYEE,

You're welcome for my time as I find it quite valuable. I don't appreciate my time being wasted when I've gone through the process of applying for and asked to be interviewed for a job, just to then be told, ""Thanks but no thanks."" Great that you found someone. But I suggest next time you have an open position, be a lot more selective in your selection process or have the common courtesy of actually following through with an interview that you requested so as to waste anyone's time.

Do both of us a favor and remove my application and résumé from your system permanently.""

Look... employers...if you're reading this, take notes...

STOP WASTING PEOPLE'S FUCKING TIME!!!

If you schedule an interview, follow through with it. If the date YOU PROVIDE is too far out for you, and the applicant chose that?? Contact them to see if they can move it up. DO NOT FUCKING WASTE THEIR TIME. You agreed to a time, hold up to it. You do it to your employees all the time.

So Shout It Out Design, if you're reading this, do better...",1644458561.0

I was a single assistant though covid and the last 2 years. That means I did everything for the office from ordering to clean and all chairs work along with helping out hygienist and front office work. I was working 6 days a week and really loved the dentist I worked for. About 12 years ago I was physically assaulted by the front office lady. I called her a bad name and she slapped me across the face. Long story short we both still worked at this office, but she was at times very hostile towards me my family and some of the patients. She started having problems at home and she would have screaming, cussing phone calls with family while patients were in the office. The dentist would turn up the suction machines to make noise to cancel her out so the patients wouldn't hear. This all became too much for me to handle and today I called my boss and turned in my key and quit. I feel bad as I really enjoyed working for him. I thought as this woman is well past retirement age I could outlast her, but she is using his office as an escape from her home life.

This woman is a grade-A Karen who runs on abusive behavior and intimidation. She has threatened staff, insulted and belittled us, and has attempted to get multiple of my coworkers fired. We can't (read: aren't allowed to) do anything about her because it hasn't become physical or gotten to the point that we would need to call the cops. Apparently, that's not enough for her. She wants to work with us now. 

Several of my coworkers and I spoke to our boss about this woman. We clearly explained that under no circumstances should she be hired. We work with sensitive information, including peoples' names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and emails, and financial information. This woman should never have access to that based on her behavior. My boss replied that we're desperate for workers and we'll have to get over petty personal issues. 

My boss doesn't care because she won't be the one working with MegaKaren. Boss only sees a body in a chair and doesn't value the opinions of her staff who have worked for years here (boss has only worked at the business for \~18 months). She doesn't believe us when we raise valid concerns about someone we would be forced to work with unless we quit. 

It needs to be a team of us lower staff who decide who we work with. We would have a much stronger, more capable team. We would hire people who would have a better likelihood of getting along with us. Of course, that wouldn't happen because it would take away half of my boss's ""purpose"".

&#x200B;

Since 2017 I have been heavily involved in Twitch communities and made many connections. I have streamed on and off since 2017, sometimes for a year at a decent schedule, sometimes nothing at all. I absolutely love the being online, the networking, the content creation, the live streaming. It's something I've been extremely passionate about. I only have a HS Diploma, only worked blue collar manufacturing jobs. The job I have now, I make almost $35/hr. However I work midnight to 8am, have to sleep during the day, and i'm just extremely tired all the time. I've worked there for 5 years. Within the last year I've been strongly considering leaving and going headfirst into content creation and live streaming with the small community I have now and working hard as hell to expand it. I do have many ideas to achieve this, I just have to execute them properly. 

&#x200B;

Well I pulled the trigger, I left that job and I'm pursuing what I have been so passionate about. I love the tech that goes along with creating content. I was so sick of having to be at work. The last time I was at work was Monday and I felt like leaving that night. Sick of having to punch a clock every night. Sick of possibly getting forced to work weekends even if I didn't volunteer. There's much more. But now I can put all my extra time into content creating and doing what I love.

Sorry if this was terribly worded, my mind is all over the place and still have a lot of anxiety over this but I haven't been happier. Thoughts? Questions? I'll take criticism as long as it's constructive :) Thanks for reading!",1644461934.0

Back in March of 2021 I returned home from another state (moved there because of my now ex gf) and was looking for some quick work because I can't live off savings and my credit card forever. Just kind of applied for anything and everything I could. 

In July I was contacted by a company that assembled display items for stores. Things like grills, bikes, chairs ETC. Interview was over the phone, and I was told I'd be making 500-700 a week, basepay plus commission. I thought it sketchy but needed a job so i took it thinking i could just find something else later.

First week: Training, which means no commisions and I get a nice check of 440 (Min wage here is 11$ an hour and I only worked 40 hrs so no big deal)

Second week: Starting Commissions, I scan items as I put them together using their little app. Had to work a lil extra time too so I was at 50 hrs at the end of the week, didn't care cause I thought i was getting overtime. Got a check of 200 dollars.

Third week: My final week, I get yelled at cause apparently cleaning up the packaging from the items we assemble is not considered work. I didnt find out what my check was till Wednesday, I was not happy. Thursday I show up ready to work, 15 min later I text my manager saying that the pay isn't enough for me to stay/care and left. I get paid another 200. I sign up with a temp agency for laborers that same day.

A month later, I started working for a company that's building a solar site nearby. (Through the temp agency.) I am now the Assistant Superintendent. I now make over 1k a week and all I do is sit in my truck and watch other people work.

TLDR: My old job paid 200 a week for 50 hrs of manual labor. I quit and now I sit on my ass all day for 1k a week.",1644461087.0

Our last manager, for some reason, decided to get rid of the security guards. Sure, it was only one person a week (on Sundays), but at least it was something. And I'm sure they could always contact the company if they need security on another day of the week (preferably every day, but that's just my opinion). 

Recently, we've had a group of maybe 10-15 late teens/early 20s misbehaving. They keep taking the basketballs from one of the games, and lobbing them around (and at each other). A few days ago, they were playing dodgeball with them in the main reception area. They did something similar today, but much less extreme. It still sent me into a panic attack. 

Our current manager says he's working on getting a security guard. I'll be completely honest: I don't feel safe. Although I drive home, I still work until 1-2am most shifts. Although I'm almost never the only staff member out on the floor, I still do feel unsafe. We don't have many staff, and anything could go wrong. That group could corner me, or one of them could follow me round to the back. They could easily throw my walkie talkie away, and just as easily overpower me. 

I haven't set myself a time limit yet, but I can't take this for much longer. I feel bad for my coworkers, but I don't want to put myself in harm's way unnecessarily. If we don't get official security soon, I'm leaving. Does this seem like a fair resolution?",1644458100.0

It's now in the "" this must be an actual form of torture used in prison camps that administration found out about"" category. Without going into more details because I don't feel safe doing that on a public forum, I will say that they are  controlling our bathroom breaks and using loud siren- like noises played from a speaker( at top volume)  from a megaphone system to get our attention before making announcements on the intercom to make sure we're paying attention. The intercom system is faulty to begin with so often we will have feedback noises and the siren sounds stuck on a loop for minutes at a time, multiple times throughout the day. 

 I want to call out tomorrow because my body is reacting to extreme stress and my own PTSD has been triggered like it's never been triggered before ever since they started using the goddamn siren noises. I tried asking/ pleading with the administration team to stop using that sound and even revealed how it was triggering my own PTSD , which isn't something I ever talk about and theyre still doing it..

A number of other people are saying it's not as simple as that and, really, when have you ever actually seen it play out that way?

Hence my question: has anyone here ever been in this situation? That is:

- Discussed wages with a co-worker (as is your legal right)
- Threatened with termination for doing so
- Terminated
- Filed a retaliation complaint (and if so, with which office/dept., or was it a private lawsuit?)
- Won the case and received compensation

I'm also interested in more general stories where you've been fired, regardless of reason, and then successfully complained and won.

Accounts of this process working and specifically how it worked would be very useful to people here in understanding what's actually possible in practice, rather than just in theory.

Lead the department I am in an make $18/hr. Started at $14. Working as a painter using automotive paints, but it doesn't have anything to do with cars, just plain old manufacturing. 

The thing with painting is that there are many compatibility issues with various products, which means what works at this place isn't necessarily going to work at other places. As it stands now, I am the only employee who knows all the ins and outs of our process. Even bringing in another skilled painter would mean they would need training on a number of things.

**The good:** Flexible with hours, just need to put in the minimum of 32 hours. As long as you get your workload done you're good to go. They are very safety conscious, buy the best of the best in order to diminish the health risks, though you can't ever fully eliminate them all. Company pays for all monthly costs of health insurance. Dental insurance is paid by employee, but it's damn good. 

**The bad:** They hired a new guy to work under me last year when I was elevated into the role. Found out they got hired at $16/hr and got a $1 raise within six months. While it's good the company is beginning to offer better pay initially, I feel I deserve a wider gap with such an inexperienced worker. Being the person who knows our entire process, I now feel VERY undervalued. Was getting pretty tired of the monotony before finding this out, but now hate going in with every fiber of my being.

**The fear:** Don't have an alternate plan. Don't want to stay in the industry, so don't want to get an offer to leverage this place with. Just want out. 

Fortunately, due to VERY STRICT budgeting for the past several(4-5) years, there is a decent amount in savings. While it was hopefully going to be used for a down payment on a house, it could sustain me for two years if I stay as cheap and frugal as I have been.

After a lot of thinking, I have decided that I am work 40% more than I am making, because that's the amount it will take to afford a home, and I'm at a point in my life where I fucking deserve that. This company will NEVER go with an increase that high. I am confident with this, because the dude who's worked there 20 years doesn't even make that much.

sotisz,This is why there are no good daycare teachers left.,8,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sotisz/this_is_why_there_are_no_good_daycare_teachers/,0,"I'll start with that I worked in daycares for almost two years. For the moment, I will not name names, because the companies are really good, just specific locations gave horrible experiences.

&#x200B;

My first daycare (partnered with a bank), back in Texas, was absolutely amazing and the people were the best coworkers I could ever ask for. Even when we only had 4 teachers after we reopened after COVID, I was allowed to call off for a mental health day, because they were accommodating my depression, even though they really didn't have to. I was only getting paid 10.50$/hr, but I loved every second of my workday, so I didn't mind.

&#x200B;

Moved up to Iowa after around 8 months of being there, and just transferred locations since it was a big company (partnered with a hospital). Started at 11$/hr, and everyone was super nice, for the first month. After a while, comments kept getting made at me and behind my back, gossiping was out of control, and even though I loved seeing my kiddos (I worked in the infant classroom), I couldn't stand being there.

I often had to call out due to illness, and got turned down lots of times. ""I have an 100.6 F temperature right now, it's not safe for me to come in and be around infants."" They told me to take ibuprofen and come in, otherwise it'd be a mark against me. Left one day due to migraine and the constant need to puke. Got talked bad about. Called out because I was literally crying from pain and had to run to the ER. ""Can you come in? We have no one to cover for you"". I literally had to contact the regional manager to get her to make my management to start doing the required daily covid checks that they weren't, and still got told to come in.

I wasn't allowed to call out, but I had a coworker calling out during a teacher shortage, and I was made to pull a 12 hour shift, open to close, with just one, one hour break (That I'm pretty sure got cut short because the teacher breaking me was needed elsewhere?) Eventually started getting less and less hours, and for my health, got moved to the preschool room when I asked, because I was in tears one day, after a really stressful day of being made to work by myself. The comments got worse, not just for me, but for everyone. Once I had a week where I was only scheduled for 8 HOURS. During NAPTIME. So no kids to interact or play with. Turned in my 2weeks the next day for a remote position. My last day of work, HR started calling all the employees to ""finally meet them"", but really enough of us had reported our managers that they started investigating. (I was informed that the regional manager covered for them and so they were not removed from the positions.)

(Edit: I just checked, and the director and co-director of this center are actually gone! As are most the people I actually knew, but a lot of them were working on leaving when I was.)

&#x200B;

2 months later, I missed working with kids, so I looked for new daycares. Ended up at another big company, like my last one, but making 14$/hr, which was still low, but much better pay. The teachers in the infant room seems really nice... but I started looking for a new job after the first week. Despite COVID, teachers were moved between rooms like crazy, even in the middle of their shifts. My co-teachers started talking bad about me to my director, and complaining about my habits instead of talking to me about it. One day, we got no afternoon bathroom breaks in the infant and toddler classrooms. I quietly brought this up to the co-director as I was headed out for the day, and got scolded the next day for being ""assertive"" and ""disrespectful"". I later got told that ""no gossiping is allowed. That's what breaks a team"", and then my directors next line was ""\[A\] told me that \[B\] said that you..""

Since I'm not used to the cold, post-nasal drips have been very common since I moved, and so I brought it up during my lunch one day that I had one, and was promptly sent home and told not to come back without getting tested, which I guess is fair, except for the fact that I called and told the co-director that it would take maybe 10 hours for the results, to which she said ""We'll assume we'll see you tomorrow then unless you call and say otherwise!"" I got scolded the next morning as I tried to discreetly show my negative test to my director, and she said I was supposed to call and tell them I was coming.

They were in absolute disbelief when I told them that none of my other coworkers at my other two daycares have never had a problem with my behaviour and teamwork. They were the first to refuse to understand me and work with me on literally anything. Although.. they did say that they'd love to see me leading a classroom one day.. I am very confused about that still.

And one day I came in, after walking in the pouring rain, and left halfway through with signs of hypothermia, and they gave me a strike for leaving early, because I wouldn't let them call an ambulance and put me in even more medical debt than I was already in. When I turned in my ""week and a half notice"", they went ""We'd be more than happy to make it one week!"" And I took it because I wanted to be gone more than they wanted me gone.

&#x200B;

Now I'm working retail, and even though I do more physical labor than I did in the daycare field, I am much happier to be in a supportive place instead of a nightmare daycare.

&#x200B;

I also ran into one of my coworkers from the last daycare, and they said that most of the preschool room was quitting because they hate it there, and they have no idea how the center even passed re-certification, because the teachers treat the kids horribly too.",1644455871.0

If I was being paid the correct amount.

I started at this company 3 years ago, very junior but eager. Over those 3 years I've increased my qualifications and experience ten fold, to a point where I have become an integral part of the company, and alot of flights would not be able to go ahead without me.

Naturally I assumed my qualifications would come with a pay rise, and according to the law, it should raise my pay by about 10 dollars an hour.
Woohoo right?
well Humble reader, not woohoo, very far from it.

you see, after asking the HR manager about my now legally required minimum pay rate (that I've been entitled to for 5 months now), he told me to talk to finance, who then passed me back to HR who then told me to email the companies CEO.
I sent an email to him, asking him when I could expect the raise, he told me to set up a meeting with him
Fantastic! 
emailed back quickly asking when worked for him

and I've yet to get a response.
that was 2 months ago, I have since sent an email every Friday, kindly asking to set somthing up.
No response.
so it seems his tactic is to ignore me and hope I just give up.

Well I'm not, at this point I'm livid, I work 11 hour days (legal maximum) every day with barely a day off. I'm literally never seeing my family, I haven't gone to the gym in months and I have no time to enjoy any hobbies.
So I email the HR manager again, asking if she could pretty please help me.
Nope
all pay rises go through the director.

""For fuck sake"", I scream from 15,000ft in the air.

ok fine. I see the HR manager in person, she handles all the directors affairs, can she set up a meeting?
Nope
apparently he's now got covid and is house and bed ridden for days.
ok well who do I see then now that the director is literally bed ridden.

Apparently still the director.

but... he's bedridden and can't so anything

well he still handles it all, but I shouldn't message him because he's very very sick.

He’s the lead install man there. I had construction experience for the past 3 years so he wanted me for my tool experience yada yada yada. He thought I would be a good fit for the job. So I took it, and he started me off high in terms of pay hoping I would stay. This is beginning of January this year. My first week, I get bit by a customers dog while I’m carrying their refrigerator on the dolly. I’m on a blood thinner, so I go to the urgent care to get taken care of. From this point on, I ask if we can tell customers to please put their dogs away while we’re working in their home. I bring this up to our boss and he’s totally cool with it. Most people at this point agree with me that it’s common courtesy for customers to do this anyway. The problem is, the lead install guy who got me the job is a dog lover. He himself owns two pit bulls who he loves to death. He feels that it’s RUDE of me to ask customers to put their dogs away, and he refuses to do it himself. So I continue to do this since the boss is okay with it, and I’m not trying to get bit again by somebody’s 200lb mastiff. At this point my anxiety is high around large dogs. Weeks go on and he becomes visibly irritated by me asking customers to politely put their dogs away before we come in. Today at the end of the day, he tells me that he’s letting me go. His words were “it sucks man, you’re a good worker and you pick up really fast but I can’t have you be afraid to go into somebody’s house who has a big dog. I think that we are doing our customers a disservice by asking them to put them away.” I ask him if this is seriously the only reason he’s letting me go, that there has to be something else. He says yes this is it. I am honestly baffled by this. The only reason he can have me fired is because he’s the lead install guy and has been with the company for 7 years, since we were in high school. I don’t see the big boss much, he basically just checks in with him and tells him how I am doing. I thought I was doing quite good otherwise, considering I have experience with more tools and was picking up fast.

I pretty much “did everything right.”  I got straight a’s in high school played sports, did some academic extra curricular, got Eagle Scout with the bsa, and worked over the summers to save for college. I took a gap year and worked for a construction company and then started school the next fall. 

I graduated a year early because of some AP credits and community college program my high school had. That was spring 2020 and since then I’ve worked for a factory that had 12 hour overnight shifts that were hell, and then the same grocery store I’m at now that won’t give benefits even when i was working well over 40hrs/week.  I’m also working for a local construction company that contracts out to penndot, and according to most of the other guys it’s basically a temp position the first couple of years so I’m probably getting laid off in April.

From what I’ve seen it seems like my degree is kind of a joke anyway, but it’s still a stem field and I have my OSHA 40hr hazwoper and environmental specialist cert.  Ive been thinking about going back to school for an engineering degree while my parents are still cool with me staying with them, but I don’t like the idea of more debt, and although it’s not unbearable, and I’m grateful for having a place to stay, I’d like to move out at some point. On top of that I don’t know if going to school for another 3-4years is worth it for something that’s not guaranteed, but I don’t know what else to do. I never go out and pretty much just work , sleep, and sit around on my day off because I’m always tired.",1644454833.0

I only worked at this place for 4 days and my boss only came into the office on Tuesday which was my first day at work. She did not come in the rest of the days that week. My coworker told me, my boss's kids got Covid after my boss left the office. This was something that made me uncomfortable since I was sitting next to her when she was going through the employee handbook with me and taking off her mask to drink coffee.

I didn't have a strong feeling at that time but was just uncomfortable until Friday that week when my boss said she tested positive for Covid. This made me upset, uncomfortable and felt disrespected. So I sent an email to my boss about my concerns and feelings.

All I wanted and expected from her is just something like ""Thank you for your concern, I will be more careful and transparent about the situation next time."" Instead, I got this.

And he has Crohn's disease. I am a teacher and had saved my leave for years in case of an emergency like this. I took 5 weeks off back in September. My principal went through my records and put a disciplinary note in my file about not following expectations to record grades, even tho I was on leave. 

They also tried to say I didn't follow my department protocols, but my department chair is a duplicitous piece of shit who never says what the expectation is, so I was never told what to do. 

I took my union rep to the meeting because they lied to me about what the meeting was about. I did my homework. I had all the emails to demonstrate I was following expectations. He didn't care and put it in my file anyway. He blatantly interrupted me while I was trying to share my side of things (my union rep isn't very good), and  blatantly told me when I pointed out that I was answering his questions but that he kept interrupting and I asked ""do you want me to share my information with you""? He replied ""honestly, no. I don't want to listen to you read that word for word"". Not only that he tried to get me to not tell anyone else in the school about the situation. 

The last part was that I pointed out to him this was an incredible technicality to be dealing with since I have a spotless employee record. He tried to say that it was just standard practice on their end (it's not. I am well aware of teachers who break important rules and are ignored). I said, this wasn't how this had to be handled. And be tried to insist it was. That when I pointed out this is not how ""family"" works. 

He was visibly flabbergasted. He said at that point he had said all he had to say. 

Fuck that mother fucker. Fuck him. I have not once been disciplined at that job in seven years and he went back 5 months to find something that happened while I was on FMLA and would not even listen to what I had to say. 

Here's the kicker. A few years ago we worked in a different district at different schools. I worked at an ALE for kids who are struggling at regular school. I always took their stories with a grain of salt, because I know what it feels like to be an angry teenager. I believed them, but I left room for a different pov. Nope. Those kids were right to the letter. He is an absolute piece of shit and if he got ran over by a truck tomorrow, I would go out and get a beer to celebrate. He has hurt so many of my students just because he loves rules. That's it. I've tried to stand up for the kids. And that may be why I got punished. The kids like me. They told him as much. I get zero parent complaints. But he hates anyone who stands up for people who are marginalized. He wants kids to sit in their seat, shut up, work their ass off to get good test scores to make himself look good. We'll see how that works out. Lol

Teachers, quit. You guys need to quit. I wanted to save the kids and the schools, but this is what they always do. They hire someone like him to keep everyone beat down and following orders. Just quit got Christ sake.

Anyway, they'll be lucky if I finish the semester.",1644453870.0

**I'm already judging. No shame.**

I don't buy, I don't believe, and I never will, that increasing minimum wage is the solution to the problem,

**This tells me you've never seriosuly considered our argument, and you will never listen and try to understand in the future.**

and believe me, I am with you guys, there is a problem that needs an immediate solution.

**Yup, that people cannot survive off their wages. Just stating what I think you're implying.**

Consider that wage is an arbitrary number, no different than price, it's malleable and it often inappropriately assigns the incorrect value to a commodity.

**Ok, so what I'm getting from this is you believe a wage is just a number that isn't always the value of someone's work. It can be more or less, but you believe there is an ""absolute value"" (if you will) of someone's work that is not connected in any way to the money they make for that work.**

**If work has a value disconnected from what someone's wage is, what would that be? How would we calculate it?**

**For me, the value of my labor is priceless. That is time I am never getting back, time that I could be spending doing what I love to do, such as spending time with my family, being creative, or relaxing.**

Cost and Margins are real variables that define value, and I don't mean cost as a price, I mean cost as a real cost, expenditure of energy and the tradeoff of value.

**You believe that the cost of something is equal to the energy someone puts into a product (for example) combined with... whatever you mean by a ""tradeoff of value."" (Clarification here would be nice.)**

**So if my labor is priceless yet someone says they'll pay me $7.25 an hour for my labor and I accept (for whatever reason), that becomes the cost of my labor for the business, despite my evaluation of it.**

There isn't a subcontractor, or contractor, or supplier that hasn't sent me a letter saying that the cost of business is going up, and therefore, the prices are going up.

**So, none of the businesses have given a reason as to why they are increasing prices.**

It simply gets ""passed on"", the numbers, digits, and accounting all changes, but the value equation (The cost and margins) never do. That's why is gets passed on, passed on in this context also means, ignored and meaningless.

**You're saying that the representations of value (the dollar amounts attributed to products or services) are changing, but that they are meaningless because the actual value of the product or service has not changed.**

**Ok, so my labor is valued as priceless, so, according to your logic, that the dollar amount attributed to anything is meaningless, why can't I change that dollar amount? What if I say I want $13 an hour for my labor? It's still a great discount to the business because the value of my labor is priceless.**

Minimum wage is meaningless. What we need, is a value minimum.

**You're saying that because a wage isn't and never is equal to the actual value of a product or service, it would be pointless to force one onto it. You think we must legislate a fixed number onto what the value of something is worth.**

**Honestly I don't see the difference between setting a minimum wage and legislating a set value for labor. That's exactly what a minimum wage is. It is telling companies that their employees' time and effort is worth AT LEAST the dollar amount decided upon.**

**Right now, on the federal level, that is $7.25/hr, or 15k/yr if they work full-time. Anyone getting paid that is living in poverty in America. If you say there should be no minimum wage, you are saying that businesses should let their employees live in poverty.**

In the economic structure we have created, profit (not in dollars), but in margin, is how value is defined. We can change the numbers all we want; it can't affect the value of something. 30 cents on a dollar, or 300 on 1,000 is still 30%, the value of those two examples remains the same.

**You're saying because we can express 30% margins as 30 dollars for every 100 or 3 cents for every 100 or however else we would like to put it in numbers, that margins are the ""real"" immutable measures of value.**

**If I make 30 cents for every dollar I spend, and I make 100 dollars in gross profit, that means my net profit is 30 dollars. The profit margin, then, is 30%. Profit and margins are two different ways to represent the same figures.**

The price we attach to the value is just quick economic data produced by the market for reference (a function of quantity of goods versus quantity of money), it doesn't change the value in the long term.

**You believe that prices are just a snapshot of the supply and demand in the moment, but that a product's value does not change in the grand scheme of things.**

**If there is a lot of something, it is less valuable. That is why its price decreases. Milk does not hold some inherent ""value"" that is independent of supply and demand.**

You can't alter the value of labor by arbitrarily changing the price by compelled legislation. It's as ridiculous of an argument as saying ""We'll just pass a law that says Milk must cost 1 dollar a gallon""

Did that law reduce the actual value of Milk by 80%? The answer is certainly, no.

Forget about profit, it's just a number. On the flip side of the equation, you have Margins, that are a far more accurate representation of the value that business owners are extracting from their business.

**You believe profit and margins are different values.**

**As explained above, they are in fact two ways to represent the same thing.**

No matter what happens to the minimum wage, no matter what compelled labor price laws are enacted, the margin will remain the same, the economic data gets passed onto the consumer.

Economic data (prices) go up in order to ensure the margin, representative of the cost of doing business, remains the same.

**You believe that margins and value are the same thing, therefore, if the cost of running a business goes up because the minimum wage is raised by legislation, the margin, wanting to remain the same, magically makes prices goes up simultaneously, since the value of the product or service is the same as it was.**

**It's amazing how close you got and still missed the mark. We want businesses so make less profit. We want the margins to get smaller. That is how you can pay people more and not raise prices for the consumer. Don't pay your CEO billions of dollars. Don't MAKE billions of dollars. Make millions instead. Stop being greedy with your fucking money. That's the point.**

I think a better solution, is to look at ways to refine and distribute the margin side of the equation. Let businesses chase profits to the extreme but have a value sharing equation that distributes margins back to the employees. ""Profit sharing"" would not even work,

**So you want to distribute the margins back to the employees, but not the profit.**

**As said before, profit and margins are not 2 different things. You are in fact saying that you want the money made by employers to be shared with employees. That is profit sharing.**

because Ofcourse, profit is like minimum wage, just the other side of the equation and can be just as easily manipulated, you have to close the accounting loopholes that businesses would immediately use to increase cost and reduce profit, which they would do to maintain the value margins.

**So profit is something that can be manipulated to be higher or lower depending on what the business's costs are. To keep the margins the same with increased costs would mean less profit.**

**Exactly. That's what we want.**

The value margin can always be calculated after all the accounting tricks are done.

OfCourse, the other primary factor to be used is to increase the value of labor by reducing the supply. Organized labor is the solution here.

**So to increase the value of labor is to have less workers, and they need to be organized.**

**Well having less workers isn't an option, so organizing sounds like a good plan, and what would we ask for once organized?**

**A fucking minimum wage.**

Just some thoughts. TL;DR - Minimum wage won't help.

**TL;DR I really hope you're a troll, because this entire thing melted my brain with its stupidity.**",1644452063.0

John is a baker, Jim is a butcher and Joe is candlestick maker and they all get to meet in the town square of their local village to set prices and negotiate the value of their own labor. Sounds great, right? What could be bad about a system like that right?

Nothing really. Under those conditions and those assumptions, capitalism and free markets are one of the greatest things to happen to mankind. The problem is those conditions and assumptions no longer match reality in the age of technology and automation.

John and Jim have had their bakeries and butcher shops put out of business by grocery stores and now work for them directly with the value of their individual tradecraft marginalized by machines that allow for mass production of quality goods by people needing a fraction of the training once required. Joe, unfortunately, is homeless now, because there hasn't been a need for a dedicated candlemaker as an essential tradecraft since they became mass produced by factories. 

All of three of these people are examples of the philosophical change of companies which has been occurring over the last half a century. Instead of taking their profits and reinvesting them into the work force in an attempt to attract the most skilled workers to boost productivity and quality, companies are investing their profits into technology designed to increase productivity and quality while reducing the training and talent required by their workforce to perform said jobs. This has created a massive jolt in the productivity of the workforce while creating a stagnation in wages.

This divergence in productivity and compensation began in the 1970s and is often attributed to the dissolution of the gold standard and the beginning of unhindered printing of the U.S. dollar. While I don't doubt this plays into it, this is also the time period when computer technology truly began to take off with 1968 being the year of the invention of the first modern computer, 1969 containing the birth of UNIX, 1970 birthing the first DRAM chip, 1971 creating the floppy disk drive and 1972 presenting the first home game console.

Technological advancement and it's effect on the value of labor is now starting to reach it's crescendo with automation now beginning to replace the need for workers entirely instead of simply reducing the value of their labor. 

Is this a bad thing? No, it's not. A human being spending their life working on the floor of a Tyson chicken factory as a cog in a machine is an awful existence and it's better replaced by a new machine which can be the missing cog in the machine.

It is, however, a bad thing in a system which ties the distribution of resources to the common man as a function of his or her labor. Many will argue that the old jobs will be replaced by new jobs servicing the machines and working with the technology, but yet this is not a very realistic stance. If the new system was able to provide enough jobs working with machines in order to ensure our entire population had enough labor to acquire the resources they needed, it would defeat the purpose of building machines to do work for us in the first place.

Yet, despite this growing issue, we have only had one presidential candidate who made this a serious part of his campaign. That was Andrew Yang. His idea that was dubbed Universal Basic Income by the media was actually an attempt to redistribute the benefits of this increased productivity from globalism and technology back down to the common man who was finding his labor increasingly devalued in a system that required labor to acquire resources.

Despite this, he was considered a joke candidate by many and was ignored by many people who are participating in this subreddit today with their votes going to candidates who still don't even recognize this as an issue and maintain a view in which the value of labor was the same as it was in 1920.

The point of my post here to day is to shed light on this issue and to help people understand that mass striking and resignation of jobs to force wages up will only get so far in a system that increasingly does not need our labor anymore.

The old adage of ""Work hard and you will be rewarded"" doesn't work when all profits are going towards the creation of technology designed to reduce the need for hard work, the very thing tied to the distribution of rewards in the system itself.

In the next election, please consider voting for a candidate who is making this issue a central part of his campaign.

Thank you.",1644451418.0

I'm 23 and recently moved back to live at home with my parents, after having tried and failed to get a degree in engineering. 

At my work, I asked for more responsibility because I'm one of the people who's worked there the longest, and I know how everything works. I guess I thought I could help new hires with training and wanted to see what (low level) management was like. My boss gave me a $2 an hour raise after I took on some of these responsibilities. However, I've discovered I don't like the responsibility, and I am allowed to schedule myself more time on the clock to do these responsibilities, but I never feel like doing it because I don't have the external motivation of someone else checking on me. Another factor is the drive, it used to be a 20 minute drive to work when I was at university, but since I've moved back home to live with my parents, it's now 50 minutes to drive to work and I hate sitting in the car driving to work when I could be sleeping.

Anyways, I called in sick almost two weeks ago because I was depressed and wanted to go back to sleep after sleeping all night, and the next day I was supposed to work my boss called me and I told him I was still too sick. The day after that I was scheduled to work I actually went in, but left early because we were overstaffed so I made up some bs about having a migraine because I didn't want to be there. My boss is pretty understanding, but it's now been a week since the day I showed up and left early, and he wants me to call him today. What do I say? ""Sorry, I was depressed and couldn't get out of bed except to pee and eat microwaved food for a week""? My boss does employ some remote workers, I'm not sure if he needs any more, but I'm thinking about asking for a remote position or to be mostly remote and only go in person occasionally.",1644451359.0

Up to now it’s been a good job, everyone’s had a mutual understanding of each other, everyone was treated equally, flexible etc., but it’s changed since this growth. 

Over the weekend I fell over onto my ankle quite badly , by Sunday it was pretty obvious I wasn’t gonna be able to make it into work on the Monday. But it’s no big, it’s an admin job and I have a laptop with the system on so I can basically do the job from anywhere. I offered to work from home as other than my ankle I was fine, and got a bit of a begrudging “ok”

Informed HR guy, to which the first comment was “oh, were you drunk? If so it was self inflicted” first of all…it doesn’t matter if I’m drunk or sober. If I’m hurt I’m hurt? Tf?

So come Tuesday (yesterday) ankle wasn’t getting any better and everyone put the fear of god into me that it was broken, so was recommended I go to the hospital, I gave in and went to the hospital, work kept in the loop the whole time, was there a couple hours. Even IN hospital I was answering calls and emails from my phone, and carried on working when I got home

The hospital informed me I’d significantly damaged ligaments and soft tissue , advised 2 weeks of rest (no driving, sports, or long walking) and light physio exercises. For context I work in rural countryside an hours drive away, public transport isn’t really an option 

I then got a weird email this morning asking me “what I should be put down as” (basically wanted me to say off sick) and then got a text message asking me to call and discuss my unavailability this week. 

I called them instantly and basically immediately questioned the use of the word “unavailable”. I explained to them that me working from home doesn’t affect my ability to do my job, yes I’m injured, yes I had to go the hospital, but I’ve still been working, and available. 

And so HR guy tells me they’ve made the decision to not pay me for the day I went to the hospital because there’s “no way I could have been working in the hospital” despite them pressuring me to go so they had a better idea of how long I would be out the office for. They said this in the name of “being fair across everybody” despite me literally being witness to the fact that’s a bare faced lie MANY times 

It was never mentioned in my contract that this would be the case, and they always emphasise how “flexible” they are and how the beauty of the job is that you can do it from anywhere. They literally had this stupid bullshit seminar not long ago about us being open about if there’s anything going on (mental / physical illness) so they can always be there for us and support us the best they can. 

I’m furious. My family member also works there and ended up having a huge row over the whole thing (straw on the camels back though, lots of tense stuff, very toxic work environment) and has quit over it. Luckily I settled a new role but waiting for all the relevant checks to go through etc.

I come from one of the non-EU countries and work as a Senior Systems Engineer (IT) in one of the EU countries. Due to covid I had lost my job back in 2020 and struggled to find a job for 8 months as no organization was ready to sponsor me a visa. A year ago my current company had posted a job on Indeed stating the salary range would be €40-55k/annum which was confirmed by the HR as well. After I cleared the interview, the HR offered me €35k salary. I tried negotiating, also said this is not what it was mentioned by you or on the Indeed job portal but the HR said this is what we can offer you (their tone was like take it or leave it). The job market was on a turmoil and I needed a visa so I accepted it. Moreover, they did not sponsor me a visa but they gave me visa sponsorship letter which I'm thankful for and I paid for my visa.

I got a good manager and everyone in my team is supportive and fun to work with. I'm enjoying my work and there is no much work pressure. Also, I get some idle time too as compared to my old colleagues who are mostly on calls the whole day.

Now, I'll complete 1 year next week and will have my appraisal meeting soon, what I have heard is that the hike is around 5%. I'm worried/scared if I negotiate they are going to be upset and create a bad work environment for me. I have no choice of moving out until I get my permanent visa in 18 months. Should I talk about it or accept whatever hike they're going to give me??

- DO NOT advise them that what they are doing is illegal. This will only work against you

- If the warning was given via group email, immediately “reply to all” and announce what you are paid.

- If the warning was given over a group chat/text, immediately respond and announce what you are paid.

- If the warning was given in a team meeting, immediately ask to speak and announce what you are paid.

- If the warning was made directly to you in private, immediately use whatever communication tool listed above will be most effective in announcing what you are paid.

- Wait patiently to be disciplined/terminated. If legally allowed to do so then secretly record the meeting.

- Again, DO NOT advise them that what they are doing is illegal.

- Be sure that any documentation of your discipline or termination specifically states it was done due to discussing wages. If not then ask for it to be specified.

- Report the violation to the NLRB and any other local agencies you can.

I called her and told her I want it back, and she stole from me. She argued a bit and tried to tell me ""but you agreed to it"", which I did not. She reluctantly gave it back, but it was taxed again.

I have been getting away with things by using my lunch for interviews, but many of my interviews are long, like 1.5 hours, so I can only take them by taking time off. I suspect my employer knows I’m trying to get out, because almost every time I try and take a half day/whole day I get denied. I am required to ask for time off a whole 2 weeks in advance, which isn’t really acceptable when trying to work around someone’s schedule who wants to interview in a week. 

We are really short staffed right now, which is an excuse I keep getting to deny me time off. I feel like I am going to miss out on interviews to others who can step away during the day. I ended up calling in sick on a day that I was previously denied because the interviewers had no other time, and I got fucked up for it by management. Is there anything I can do besides quitting so I can get my interviews and move on to something way better than what I currently have? Is denying time off consistently even legal? Kind of at a loss of what to do without getting fired.",1644447570.0

These personality traits are extremely toxic in any environment, but the toxicity is amplified in an environment without privacy. An environment where the narcissist can overhear any conversation and involve themselves in it.

An open office not only removes all privacy for everyone, they give a narcissist access to everyone.

Set up the interview time and everything...and then she drops the bomb as the very last thing before ending the conversation: starting pay is $13.32/hr. I ask her about the Indeed posting saying $15, she says it was a mistake made by corporate.

So I call corporate. Or rather, customer service, who transfers me to employee services. I wait on hold throughout the process. I tell the service rep about the situation, she puts me on hold for a bit longer then comes back and [these two conversations ensue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i93ySvI2i-Q). (I didn't know how else to attach this video besides uploading to my personal YouTube channel RIP.) Bascially, corporate told me that recruiters are in charge of those things. So I call back the recruiter I spoke to and she tries to deny that the posting is even wrong or just avoid addressing it. Finally she says ""no corporate posts them"" and says they'll change it.

I doubt they'll change it but I will do my best to be a nuisance until they do so. I'll update this post if necessary lol but I doubt it will be.

I received requests from the company/ indeed for skills and aptitude tests but I didn't get around to them because of the holiday. I received another notification that the position was filled/company no longer interested. Today, I received an email for an interview with apologies for the delay. Is this a red flag?

This is in-fact false and the employers are telling you a lie. According to the **National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)** it is your **100% right** to discuss your wages at work, during break, etc. This is your right as an **Employee** whether you are represented by a union or not. 

> Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or the Act), employees  have the right to communicate with other employees at their workplace  about their wages.  Wages are a vital term and condition of employment,  and discussions of wages are often preliminary to organizing or other  actions for mutual aid or protection.

>If you are an employee [covered by the Act](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/jurisdictional-standards),  you may discuss wages in face-to-face conversations and written  messages.  When using electronic communications, like social media, keep  in mind that your employer may have policies against using their  equipment.  However, policies that specifically prohibit the discussion  of wages are unlawful.

According to the **NLRB (National Labor Relations Board)**, it is **UNLAWFUL** for the **Employer** to prohibit the discussion of wages at work. So remember, you have **every right** to discuss your wages at work and it doesn't matter what the employer policy states, there is **no law** or even at the federal level that prohibits the discussion of wages at work.

   To be forced to perform such duties for a measly $15 an hour ($13 and some change for the folks that are still underpaid at this current moment) that actually involves atleast 2 years of accountant experience just to make a difference and not ruin either someone's day or an entire company's pay for that check is not a cheap task that can be outsourced to customer service reps and IT techs that know how to talk to people. Lying to customers, ""faking it til you make it"", and constantly lying to the very face of the indiviuals who actually control the companies' image, reputation, succes, etc and expecting to pull this off with about 10 whole days worth of training in total can have some of the sharpest minds feel like mushy dogshit.

   If I were to tell an actual customer what we went through, I'm for certain than anyone paying for any level of this service would drop it immediately due to all the dishonesty and incompetence involved all the way at the top. 

Lastly, I leave this for ANY Upper management member seeing this:

I work as a Service Engineer in the semiconductor industry. I'm not paid super well, but it's a bit above average. Business is fuckin' boomin', and we are busting ass 12 hours a day, working extra days, taking half-lunches (30-minute instead of 60-minute), and pumping out work at record pace all year.

Anyways, I went into my performance review a couple weeks ago thinking I deserve 10%. I'm on fire. Got through all of the training in half the expected time. I actually get 2x the work done compared to my Senior-level coworker, and I know this because my rate of work goes down constantly when I work with him and have to explain how to do things to him when he doesn't know.

*I am absolutely killing it*, with zero negative feedback. I even asked if there was any feedback for improvement—""Nope! You've been here a little more than a year and everyone says you're doing great. Keep it up!""

With inflation and literal knee-breaking work being done so damn fast, with zero damage to equipment, I really think 10% seems fair. I didn't get a raise last time because I ""hadn't been with the company for long enough.""

Add on the company making record profits and profit margins and all that. But I knew from reading this subreddit and others, 10% was NOT what I'd actually get. No way. Yes, it's what I deserve, but they want more profit so they need my wealth I generate for that to happen... It'll be an inflation adjustment and that's it. So 5-7% sounds about right. I'll look for a different job in about 6-9 months and get my deserved raise then, depending how stock purchase plan goes.

What I actually got? A measly 3%... 3-goddamn-percent! Inflation means I am making less than when I started and I'm more efficient and effective at my job than my Senior-level coworker who gets paid more than me...

**Guess who's dipping when their bonus check hits the bank!**

**TL;DR:** I'm doing great work. Company doing great. Got a 3% raise that doesn't even cover COL adjustment, so I'm making less than when I started. Time to take their training to another company and get the 10% raise I deserve.",1644443208.0

I worked my last job as a graduate, promised if I started on the minimum wage (8.91/hr) part time, there was opportunity for me to get promoted/pay raise/ more hours. It was hard being minimum wage, especially as I was the only person in the company being paid that little.

When my review came along, my boss told me they were looking to keep me on minimum and reduce my hours. She wouldn't even concede to giving me a title only promotion. I was frustrated, but I said nothing and worked till the end of my contract and didn't renew. I legally, didnt even have to quit. My ex boss was mad, told me I could ""just"" work fewer hours and have the government ""top up"" my wages. She wanted me to believe that she genuinely thought she was doing me a favour. 

3 weeks later I landed the cushiest job of my career. In my field, a boss who doesn't crack the whip, salaried and up to 8 weeks PTO yearly. For the first time I have had actual financial security. I am saving money, looking at getting out of debt and bettering my situation. I am gonna cling to this job like a koala on a tree my dudes. This, to me, is what I've been working my young adult life towards.

Today my manager showed me the reference I got from my last place of work. It portrayed me horribly. My old boss detailed that I used up all my sick days in the time I worked there. I have a chronic illness and I wouldn't go to work if I was sick. And mentioned that I took a day off (it was planned in advance) to go to a Halloween party. She basically portrayed me as a dumb, inconsistent and unreliable worker. Which is bullshit because I consistently met expectations and exceeded in every deliverable when I worked there. My sick days cant have impacted my effectiveness at the job as they are literally still using my content even now. 

I was so shocked when I saw the reference. I know we didn't really part on great terms, but it was incredibly professional and I never did anything wrong. Now I just realise that my old boss was a big fish in a little pond, and she's mad that I went from being the bottom of her pecking order and in a matter of weeks, ended up somewhere bigger.",1644442309.0

Email from HR:

Your response was due to Covid, you were unable to safely return to work.  Today the State of Illinois has reduced Covid mask mandates.  This is due to Covid positivity numbers being reduced, vaccine booster/vaccinations increased and hospitalizations reduced, so we expect your full return to work.  We are asking that all employees working from home due to Covid return to the office effective February 28, 2022.  We will again offer the accommodations listed below.  Please ask your physician to respond to each of our offered accommodations, if you feel you are unable to return. 

* We can provide a desk that has a distance of 6 feet between desks (recommended CDC space for Covid) and possibly up to 10 feet between desks for you. I will need maintenance to evaluate the area and they are off until Monday.
* We are able to provide cubicle style walls between desks also for added barriers.  I believe the walls are 6 feet high as well.
* We can upgrade your monitor to a large size.  This will allow for the ability to have someone view your computer screen, but still discuss work with you.  You will be able to manage work discussions without being close to co-workers and still allow viewing of your screen. 
* We have plexiglass that we can install at your desk similar to what Personal Bankers have on their desks that you could utilize. 
* We have the requirement of individuals to wear a mask when working within 6 feet of other individuals or moving in common areas, so that will not change.  
* We are also willing to purchase an air cleaner that cleans air including Covid viruses up to 99.9%, if you physician recommends this.

At this time we expect your return on February 28, 2022, when the state downgrades the Covid mandates.  If you have updates regarding our accommodations offered for your safe return to work, please forward the physician responses to each of the accommodations listed above prior to February 28, 2022 for our review.  Any communication from your doctor can also be faxed to me at the number below.",1644441217.0

The average daily pay for substitute teachers here is around 116 according to indeed and 114 according to ESS the main company providing subs. So if I were lucky enough to sub every day of the school week I would only be making 580, which is 60 dollars less than I make pumping gas.

I'm definitely not saying that gas attendants are overpaid because it sucks ALOT, the smell of gas all the time, we never get to sit, we're at the mercy of the elements.

I would love to make a living teaching our children (even though subbing is more so glorified babysitting) and not have to deal with pumping gas.

I digress. ANYway...he is selling the company to a competitor in the industry and retiring. Good riddance.

I have been ready to ask for another raise since I got bumped up (+$3.00) from minimum wage a year ago. I'm aware that inflation keeps rising and I need a raise to keep up with it. I'm also aware that the company has lost employees over the years so now we're down to just 2 full-time employees that work under him. That means that I now do the work of 2-3 people on a daily basis.

I have been hounding him to settle the deal with the new owner so that I could then have a follow-up meeting and give an ultimatum: You give me a major raise or risk this company collapsing without me to keep it afloat. The company name is going to change with a new owner. I am under no obligation to work for this new company, and they think I am on board even though I have not actually consented or signed any papers.

We have a meeting in 5 days. Does Reddit have any guidance or advice for me before I go into this?

EDIT: Second Question: Since the company I really work for is moving to another state and the new guy wants to hire me on, can I just say no to his offer and collect unemployment?",1644438353.0
son0e1,Are there any good jobs for people who aren’t in tech?,7,0.74,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/son0e1/are_there_any_good_jobs_for_people_who_arent_in/,12,"So I have worked for many years in retail, then different positions in clinics like surgery coordinator, and now I work in what is supposed to be logistics but is really a lot of customer service. I change jobs fairly often because it is the only way to get a pay increase. I’ve gone from making $11 something six years ago to making $22 an hour now. 

The thing is all of these jobs are insanely stressful. My newest position is awesome in that I get to work from home and have flexible hours. However the stress is getting to me. I have worked overtime almost every day for the last few weeks and I am still behind. The place is a god damn dumpster fire. 

But…every place I have worked for the last six years has been the same. Horribly disorganized and you are expected to do the work of three or four people. At my current job, I put in my notice and they ended up giving me a $2 raise to stay. But it still isn’t worth the stress. 

I am so tired of trying for something better and having everywhere be horrible. I don’t have super high expectations, but I’m sick and tired of working my ass of and being stressed for the money I make. 

Seems to me unless you are an executive or some type of tech person that you are screwed. I would even take a pay cut at this point to work somewhere that had a decent amount of pto and didn’t give me the responsibilities of someone who should be much higher paid. 

Anyone out there not miserable?

Want to add that I’m not looking for amazing money. I have no education besides a semester of college. I’m not expecting to make a ton of money. I have picked up skills at each job that have allowed me to move on to better money. The thing is the jobs themselves just keep getting more stressful. 

I left retail 6 years ago because they started really downsizing and expecting us to do so much with so little staff. I couldn’t run a store by myself. Little did I know that this was going to be the new norm everywhere. All I want is something that isn’t so stressful I can’t sleep at night. I don’t make enough money to worry about things that those in positions above me don’t seem to care about. 

I plan on going back to get my degree in the fall, because it is important to me. But it seems like u less I do something in tech I won’t make much more than I already do.

I’m 38 and have had a ton of jobs in my life, because I often get bored around the 1 year mark. But the worst job I’ve ever had, and the most insane reason for being fired is one of those stories that even 20 years later it pisses me off.

I was about 16 years old and got hired as a front end cashier at a small local pharmacy. My training consisted of “stand here and ring people up, and keep stuff stocked.” I taught myself everything, and would often get yelled at for not keeping all of the items stocked, simply because I had no idea where the rest of the stock was kept. 

I’d been there about a week, when we had a family emergency. We got a call that my sister was unresponsive at her boyfriend’s house. We called EMS on the way over. When we got there, it was my sister and my ex-girlfriend (we’d recently broken up because she had been getting into heavier drugs, and I wasn’t about that life). They had both been drugged and raped, and were passed out naked on his bed.

EMS showed up, they were taken to the hospital. My sister was completely out of it and I stayed at the hospital overnight because I was worried about her.

While in the hospital, my work called my parents and told them I would need to work the next day (I was supposed to be off). My father called to tell me about the message but it really wasn’t my priority.

I ended up getting home late the next morning and fell onto my bed in pure exhaustion. I passed out instantly and woke up a few hours later, now late for the shift I’d been assigned without my consent. Called the manager to let him know what had happened, and he fired me over the phone for a NCNS.

This is after explaining to him that my sister and girlfriend had been RAPED and were in the HOSPITAL, and I’d spent the night there with my sister. I was holding my girlfriend’s hand while they did the rape kit. I had to fill out police reports and talk to the “sexual assault” cop, who didn’t even know what klonopin was or that it can be used as a date rape drug. I slept in a chair for about 30 minutes and hadn’t eaten in almost 24 hours. I had to argue with hospital staff to keep the rapist out of the hospital room, got into a physical altercation with him, and got kicked out of the hospital for it.

After all that, I got fired for not showing up for a shift I wasn’t even scheduled for.",1644438018.0

Awesome! I replied saying they can call me around 4:00 pm the following day. Most people have been giving me phone interviews because...everything. The replied saying that they will be having interviews next week and to schedule a time to come in. I thought that was kinda weird so I scheduled a time for next week.

Next week rolls around and it's time to go to this interview. It's a bit of a hike but no big deal, I get to listen to more of my audiobook.

I turn the corner and see a building with an ""Impeach Biden"" flag and I think ""Oh god, is that who I'm interviewing for?"" I look back at my GPS and I still have about 0.1 miles around a bend in the road to go. Whew! I keep going and then see another building with the same ""Impeach Biden"" flag. This time, it is the building I'm supposed to go interview for.

I made a snap decision and thought, ""Anyone proud enough in their capitalist, fascist views to wave a flag like that, is not worth my time, nor worth working for."" So I drove home.

No real moral of the story I guess, but I thought you would enjoy my close encounter.

Edit: Just so we're clear, I don't care who this company supports politically. I care that *they* care enough to make a definitive statement about politics.

I'm currently working for a really good company, possibly the best I've worked before. My office is 5 mins from home, it's quiet and there's hardly any stress. I've been in the industry for so long that it's quite easy to perform my duties (though some days can be challenging).

When I was hired, I informed them I was looking for Part Time work for personal reasons. I agreed on 35 hrs a week instead of 20 (because my workload is rather light)

I am the type who used to always look for more work if I wasn't doing anything. I'd get so loaded up on work and due to how obsessive and meticulous and disciplined I am, I could maintain larger workloads than my peers. However, every last employer that I busted my ass for has always come back with the usual reasons for not paying me accordingly.

This is one of the reasons I decided to look for PT when applying. My review was in the middle of January and they gave me a glowing review BUT they'd like to see me take on a little more work. Oh and also, they're only giving a 2.5% increase (even though inflation in 2021 was 7%, so essentiallyI'm working this year for less). I've been here for 3 yrs. I'm maintaining the same level of work (non sales duties) as my peers AND outselling them. Yet I've been asked to help out more because they see that I'm finishing sooner than others.

My question is... should I do as I have in the past and take the initiative to say ""hey I'm able to help"" and take on more responsibilities or do I hold out and force them to come to me to delegate it?

The boss character, Al Harrison played by Kevin Costner, keeps telling people that he's not going to pay them.

First of all when the Russians manage to get into space first and he says the 'how'd we come second in a 2 man race' line. After that he tells everyone that they will be working late and it won't be reflected in their pay packets, so they should warn their wives.

Then later with the IBM chaps he tells them several times 'I'm not paying you' because the machine isn't working fast enough.

I don't know if that attitude is true to the person that the character is based off of, and I know it was exceptional circumstances that probably aren't reflected in today's world what with the Cold War and Space Race, but it makes me wonder what would happen these days if a boss said that to their workers.

Also, if it did happen in that way, it makes me a little more aware of how boomers expect staff to work regardless of rate of pay or expertise, as that was the attitude they were brought up with - most boomers were in their teens or early 20s when this film happened.

My father has a neurodegenerative disease (it's somewhat rare, and might give me away if I mention it), which makes him physically handicapped, and unable to drive / walk on his own. He sees a specialist in a big city about 2.5 hours away from us. When he has an appointment, I must drive him to and from the appointment, take him in and discuss our concerns with the doctor. In short, an appointment is an all day affair which I have to use PTO for (sick family time).

I work part time in office and part time at home. My company is implementing a new software system for our business. This means that I discuss system requirements via Zoom meetings. These meetings take up about 75% of my workday. Considering the amount of appointments I take my dad to, my former boss allowed me to take these calls while driving, to conserve my PTO. I can participate while driving 100%.

So this conversation happened this morning between me and my boss: (paraphrasing)

Me: Hey, just a heads up, my dad has an appointment in Big City on Monday. (February 14th)

Boss: OK, thanks for letting me know.

Me: I have a bunch of meetings scheduled for Monday, did you want me to join them while driving in the car back and forth to the appointment?

Boss: Are you a main speaker at these meetings?

Me: Yes.     **rattles off list of 6 meetings and explains 1 or 2 reasons why I am needed at each**

Boss: Well, it's probably best if you just concentrate on driving and just enter PTO for the day.

Me: OK, I can do that.

Boss: If there's anything pressing, I'll call you and we can discuss.

I was employed at a non profit for about 3 years. It wasn't the best job or the best paying job, but I liked all my coworkers and I liked that I was helping the community. One day the marketing person is moving onto another job, this guy was old school, did things like put print ads in newspapers and actually recorded and put an ad on TV. I was excited because I thought I was a no brainer to take his place after he left. I have a degree in New Media and Graphic Design and have extensive knowledge in video editing software, animation and game design. As well I knew the in and out of the company. I had also gone above and beyond in my job, helping the marketing department with new media projects, getting videos on youtube, sound editing / cleanup, making an interactive training program in Unity, and more.

I put in for the job and an interview gets set up. Everyone on my team is excited to have me as the new marketing person! Everyone thinks that this whole interview is mostly a formality. I do my interview and even do a presentation on how we can modernize our business for little to no costs, how we can do work with VR to help our clients and excite donors to get more funding. The interview goes a full 2 hours over with the hiring community asking a ton of questions. It seems the hiring committee is excited about everything I was saying! Well everyone but one lady, let's call her Karen, a 40 something, rich, board member, who is just sitting there silently. I don't think that there is a problem, maybe Karen is just taking it all in.

Two weeks goes by and I'm informed by the head of HR (A friend of mine) that I didn't get the job. I was crushed, I had been working so hard and was excited to make the non profit the best it could be. So I ask HR who was hired?  She says, ""Well, no one actually."" Wait what? So it seems they offered the job to a Middle aged white guy, who after getting the offer turned it down because he got a better offer someplace else. So I ask well why am I not getting the job? Turns out Karen said that if they just keep me in my current position I'll still do all the work I was doing and they won’t need to pay me as much as if I got the marketing job. So I probably would never get promoted as long as Karen has any say in the matter.

So I say, F this and tell HR that I'm going to be looking for other work because I got screwed over hard and this is not cool. Then I tell my boss that I'm doing my job to the letter, I'm no longer going above or beyond, not helping any other departments with projects, etc. and I let them know that it's because if there is no room for growth and if I'm stuck in this job this is all the work they are getting out of me. I immediately start sending out resumes and taking vacation and sick days to go to interviews. After about 6 weeks of this I land a job at an amazing mobile game company as a game designer. The work is way more fun, takes half the energy and I get a x2.5 pay bump!

I talked to my HR friend a few days ago and Karen has been back from maturity leave for a few months now and shocker they can't find anyone to replace me in my old position, nor can they find anyone qualified for the marketing job. Everyone that worked with me is so pissed about the situation and still says things like ""Shame \_\_\_ isn't here to do that."" or ""You know who could have had this solved this in five seconds? \_\_\_\_."" or ""Does anyone know how to do this now that \_\_\_\_ is gone?""

This is not the state of things. Maybe in some industries, but as a whole, I don't believe it. 

I was comparing notes with a colleague. We discovered in our industry about 70% of all the ""employers"" out there hiring or fishing with hiring ads do NOT respond at all to applicants after the application has been submitted. Not an email. Not a text. Nothing. And when you call, they get so triggered they are like ""REEEEEE don't call here REEEEEEE REEEEE wear your mask on a zoom call reeeereeee"". 

This number would be closer to 76% if the applicant does nothing to follow up. I don't even know what to compare this to in business. It's just plain sketchy. Even the bank has to mail you something in 30 days when you apply for something. These companies should at least pay the price of one stamp or one minute of electricity and email used to respond to applicants. 

I spoke to a recruiter who corroborated that employers are ASKING PEOPLE TO WORK FOR LESS THAN LIVABLE WAGES. The recruiter even sounds disappointed at the state of things. Seeing that her job is tied to making money off employers actually hiring. 

The current state of job applying in the year 2022 is shady. It's sketchier than the glory hole in Second Life online game. It needs to be reformed. And at times feels like you are giving over all your personal details, life history, and work, only to receive a scratcher ticket with no numbers. 

Now, these employers are supposedly taking so many steps to be ""fair"" and show ""racial equality"" and blah blah blah. Yet we fork over to them all our information, address, race, sex, gender, vaccine status, personal custom essays, rounds of interviews, yet 70%+ of them do absolutely nothing even to confirm that they are receiving the applications and receiving the applicant's inquiries. 

There is absolutely no law that I see in place or confirmation of this occurring that all our data, information, gender/sex/race information is going into a secure file vault and being protected. And not be accessed by someone in their company with a felon on their record or someone doing nefarious things.

When I had first signed the contact, I signed on for a specific salary and for a 14 month term. Now having been in the role now for 9 months, I know that this position can pay a higher salary. My performance has been exemplary and I have grown their books close to 20% (which is pretty hard to do in my industry). 

My question is, given that this is a term position, am I able to ask for a raise if my contact was to be extended? Also being that the extension is only by 4 months, is asking for a raise justified? I don't have to stay with this company, I can choose to terminate my contact anytime I'd like. However, I do like the organization and the leadership here has been fantastic. In the end, I do have to look out for me and seek the best options for my success.

In my city there's an IT coop wich is kinda famous in the IT world for the open source work they do. There's also a very big and famous supermarket chain which is a coop. The milk, cheese, yoghurt, chicken and olive oil I buy are from coop companies.

In coops you get the fruit of your work (but you also deal with the consequences). In principle, it's a democratic system, although in practice I've seen that in most coops workers delegate the majority of decisions into voted managers, and they get meetings every  months or every year to decide important topics.

In northen spain the catholic church took the initiative with a lot of coops. Some failed, some are still today up and running. There's pretty much none of that culture left, but I wonder if people should think about this setup again, and demand better conditions for coops in general, as they seem to withstand crisis better and fix population better than regular companies, for what I've read.

This should perfectly viable in the US too. In fact, I know that there are many banking coops across the country, so if it's possible with banking it's possible with pretty much any other business.",1644432425.0

One of my coworkers had lost his wife and son in a car accident a few months before. It was beyond tragic, the poor guy was really struggling, as you can imagine. He took some time off to grieve but when he came back his work wasn't up to the company's standards anymore and after a couple of weeks they fired him.

He went up to the roof and jumped off our 12 story building. I was outside and actually saw him die. I was 19 years old at the time. A crowd gathered around his body and an ambulance was called to take him away.

I don't remember all the details because I was so shocked at what was happening but I do remember very well that after a few minutes my manager came outside to tell people to go back to work. He yelled at me to ""go clock in"".

I went inside and tried to start working but there was just no way to focus. Everyone else inside was talking about it. Turns out the person who was supposed to fire our coworker had refused to do it because they realized what a shitty thing it was to do that to a grieving husband and father. So they ordered an intern to do their dirty job for them. She was a college student in her early 20s. She ended up having a complete mental breakdown because she felt so guilty and ended up being fired as well.

A lot of people quit in the following weeks and the company ended up going out of business.

Whenever I hear bosses saying that the workers don't care about the company, I remember my coworker's bloodied body on the ground. I had nightmares for years afterwards because of it.",1644430508.0
sojzw5,Getting written up for missing work,5,0.79,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sojzw5/getting_written_up_for_missing_work/,3,"I called in to work yesterday. For every day you miss or are late you are given a ""point"". 4 points is a write up. I had worked an extra day this week and called off on a day where it affected nothing as there was enough coverage. I had personal reasons to need work off. 

I tried to drop my shift on our scheduling app the night before my shift, because if it gets manager approval I wouldn't have gotten a point. But it was ignored so I texted my manager and asked him to approve it and he didn't reply so I called and that made it a call out. He starts asking me how many days I've missed and this has to be 4. I don't keep track so I just said I don't know. When I call out it's because I'm sick. I've come to work sick as dog before and my manager knows that. One time I was late because working late, commute times, and working early the next day gave me 4 hours of sleep and I slept passed my alarm. I had told my manager I was barely going to get any sleep if they kept the schedule as is those days and he didn't care. 

On the phone when I was calling out yesterday he said he'd look it up if I've missed 4 days, took my reason for calling out and of course had the ""it's your funeral"" tone of voice.

I texted my manager and told him to tell me the dates he is referring to for the points he's tallied against me and to just tell me straight up if he is going to write me up. I don't really care if I get written up and it won't stop me from calling in if I really need to. I think this manager has been waiting for a chance to write someone up. I missed work for a doctor's appointment and he asked for a doctor's note in an accusing way, as if he was going to catch me in a lie. People have been calling in a lot because we are understaffed and people are tired. However no one has gotten in trouble for calling out yet. It's time to set an example. 

Does it really matter if I get written up? What are other people's experience with stuff like this? I'm worried this will open the door for him to use my attendance against me and to be up my ass",1644430345.0

Been reading a lot lately about anti-work situations. People not putting up with BS at work just because it's expected of them. Retail workers quitting on the spot because management won't have their back against rude customers, people leaving because their HR will screw them over if they complain about hostile work conditions, that kind of thing.

I've also heard from a lot of people who would love to stand up for themselves, or for the defense of others, but they simply can't afford it. Teachers who want to stop bullying they see, but can't because they can't afford to get fired with the meager salary they have, for example.

So a thought occurred. Why not get one of those jobs and tell people to fuck off, if they deserve it? Fast food customer berating or putting their hands on one of my teenager employees? Get ready to be put on an arm lock and thrown out. Kid bullying others at school and parents or other teachers don't do anything? Time to put my pinch grip strength to good use and drag them by the ear to the principal's office and make sure the principal knows it's in their bones' best interest that they discipline students properly

What are going to do? Fire me? Sure, go ahead. I don't care. Sue me? For what, preventing assault? Defending someone else? Everyone is too broke to sue anyone else for petty reasons nowadays. Besides, we all know threatening to sue is like getting a death threat on the internet: sounds scary but no one ever really follows through with it.

I sent an email to our CEO on the way out.  The job market is good out there folks and make sure you advocating for yourself.  Anyone have the odds on this guy responding?  I put them at about zero.

Hi CEO!
 
After 8 years, today is my last day at **Company Name**. Before closing the books on my time with the company, I feel compelled to share a brief reflection with you. Thanks in advance for the time and attention.
 
Leaving this company is bittersweet for me. I’ve worked for multiple business units, multiple brands and all across the country (from **A to B to C to D** where I’ve spent the back half of the pandemic). Throughout this journey, one of key tenets **CN** and I shared has always been to prioritize doing the best work and putting the best product on the table.
 
As we define our new post-pandemic reality the insistence on a office approach is one that I believe is leading to employee dissatisfaction and attrition, especially across some of our top talent. As I watch the ever-growing list of **CN** alumni, I would like to personally encourage you to revisit this policy.
 
There will always be certain roles where being office based will be impactful, and it’s hard to argue against the intangible benefits of camaraderie - when the whole team is in person there is no better feeling. My team is spread out across the world (the benefit of working for a global company) and our team meetings and 1:1’s will be on Zoom regardless of where my desk is physically located. Irrespective of that, **CN** has insisted on locating my role within an office, directly leading to my choice to exit the company. For me, being able to visit offices frequently adds that spark to keep going but being connected to family is what starts the fire, and I know I’m not alone in adjusting my priorities over the past 2 years. 
 
The intent of this note is simply to share my story, as I think it’s useful for leadership to see examples of how their policies impact individuals throughout the organization.  Although I’m always open to a conversation, I’m sending my story with you simply so that you know it. I wish the best of luck to **CN**. I’ll be a customer for years to come and I hope for the success of this company that gave so much to me.
 
Thanks for your time,",1644429702.0

I started as a simple assembly operator, moving up into quality positions, set-up positions, and final inspection positions. I admittedly love my work. I love the fast pace, seeing how things are made, learning new things. I have worked my way into a pretty well paying job for my area.



But today, I left my job. No notice, no goodbyes, nothing.



I left, because at only 30 years old, I am facing spinal surgery.  I have dealt with back pain for the past two or three years. Brushing it off as ""all part of the job"", ""small price to pay for the grind"", or whatever other bullshit line people have been fed for the sake of capitalism. Finally, two weeks ago I was bringing in groceries, when my back sounded like a shaken up Yahtzee cup, and my legs gave out from under me. A trip to the ER, and two doctors appointments later, I learned that I had stress fractures running along my T1-4 vertebrae, as well as all of my lumbar vertebrae. Apparently they finally just caved and snagged my sciatic nerve with them. The first thing doctor asked was what I did for a living, and when I told him, his response was ""yes, well, you won't be doing that anymore"" 



At first, I was heartbroken, and also really scared. I have worked in factories and warehouses for a third of my life, almost my entire adult life. How will I pay the bills? I don't really know much else, so what will I do to survive? But then, I got angry. Angry at myself for not being more careful, and for letting myself get sucked into the never ending wheel. Angry at every boss I ever had for always pushing for bigger and better numbers. Angry at these companies who will literally milk a human body for all it's worth, taking it all the way to the break point, and have the balls to complain about laziness, lack of work ethic, and missed days. 



So, I walked away. I left a simple voicemail for my boss, letting him know that due to a medical emergency I wouldn't be returning. That I had quite literally broken my back for this company, even showing up for a couple days after the initial emergency visit, just to get chewed out for missing 3 days out of the past almost 4 years. My husband was kind enough to drive over to turn in my badge and keys, since I am heavily medicated and not exactly in a position to be driving.

I am a 27 year old female based in England, UK. I have good academic qualifications, the highest of which is a 2:1 in Law. 

I have worked from the age of 16. First 2 jobs were in retail alongside my time spent studying. 

First 'professional' role was as a Trainee Law Costs Draftsman with an 18k salary working 40 hours per week. The role itself I didn't mind but the environment was awful and my contract was terminated after 6 months after i declined to work through my lunch. All other Trainee contracts were also terminated. All termination of contracts was explained as being due to not meeting targets.

I then began working as a Family Court Clerk within the civil service. I enjoyed the role but the environment was toxic. I was working in excess of my full time hours all of the time, rarely had a lunch or even opportunity to go to the toilet, the demands and requirements and responsibilities of the role would change at the drop of a hat. The entire department was incredibly disorganised and HR just didn't exist. 

I left this role at the end of Jan 2022, and accepted a higher paid role with the DVLA to start in March. The issue is, I don't actually want this role. I don't want to work with other people anymore and I definitely do not want to be in the office 5 days a week. I am tired of roles with no employee benefits or even basic rights. I am a hardworking person who has always worked. Its not that I don't want to work but none of these jobs are desirable to me and offer poor quality of life. What can I do?

Every morning as part of my job I need to send out a series of stock emails. The system is clunky and tedious for no apparent reason. This takes 30-45 minutes out of my day, time I would much rather be napping, scrolling Reddit, or wasting my bosses time in other ways. Worst of all, my pay is heavily metric dependent and these emails are not part of those metrics. This is all time spend that essentially SUBTRACTS from the incentive portion of my pay (which is probably why they don’t spend money to fix it, because the we would also produce more and get more per unit pay.)

The system works as such, we use Salesforce (the most basic version) to compile customer emails. We then have numbered lists in sales force for each day since the customer was created and stock emails for each list. So I have a day 2 list and a day 2 email. I must manually, copy that list into an excel sheet, reformat it to correctly line up to excel (because that doesn’t happen correctly most times), open a word doc with the stock email for that day, create a mail merge, link that mail merge to the correct day in the excel that contains the names and emails, send the merge, and then make sure all the people in that list move forward one day ( so day 2 goes to day 3 so they get the day 3 email the next day). 

This seems like a task the company could fully automate for pennies.
