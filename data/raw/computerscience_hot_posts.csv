I know how to find cut vertices, but am stumped on finding blocks, at least in a complexity less than O(n^2).

BACKSTORY:

Recently, I was in a programming contest. (It is over now).

The last question was along the lines of 'there is a graph, find  which node, when removed, will make the graph the least connected' (where connectedness is the amount of node pairs who are connected). In the start, there are at most 10000 nodes and 200000  edges, and the graph is initially connected. 

The case for graphs is easy (count how many nodes are at each edge for all nodes in O(n+e), and for each edge add up n(n+1)/2 for each edge, for a total complexity of O(n+e).

Therefore, I realized that a bct would be a good solution for the general case. I am mostly asking this question now because I was unable to find any resource during the competition, and am curious for my own learning.",1644780266.0

sqt9uf,Cryptographic hashes can't be reversed because information is lost but can it be reversed to some other string of bits that produces the same hash?,Discussion,42,0.89,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/sqt9uf/cryptographic_hashes_cant_be_reversed_because/,26,"First of all, I am a total noob in my 1st semester. The intuition I built for hash functions being irreversible was that say I take a string ""ABCD"" I can sum up their ASCII values and get a hash of some sort (266) and I know that you can't take this value and go back to ABCD without brute forcing because their sum does not tell which value it was precisely was like 10 + 18 could also be written as 26 + 2 and therefore, information was lost here but what if instead of trying to reverse it to ABCD, we could just reverse it to some other string of characters that make the same hash for example: àà which both have the ASCII values 133 so if we compute it's hash from the simple *adding ascii values function*, we will get the same 266 hashed value i.e., a hash collision even though the information isn't the same. As you all already know that passwords are verified this way by matching input's hash with the stored hash, is it theoretically possible to compute any other string of characters (or bits) without brute forcing from a SHA-256 or even an MD5 hash that although isn't the same as the original set of bits,  produces the same hash.

So let’s say for our frontend we’re using a React application, our backend a Flask server running, and a Postgres database.

1. For the longest time I thought that React was a javascript framework that runs on a server (because npm start makes it seem like it’s running on a server) but apparently that’s only for local development. Why does local development run on a server and not when you deploy it? What’s the difference between running npm start versus if you had just static html files and opened those up?

2. I know that there’s talk of frontend and backend frameworks, but if our Flask server returned HTML and we got rid of our React application, what’s our frontend tool in this case then? Does that mean any backend framework (like Django or Flask) could also be considered a frontend framework? Since we could have Flask on the “frontend” returning HTML and a Django server acting as our backend. Or even just Flask all by itself! I guess I’m still confused about this separation in terms of the technology/frameworks I know of.

3. A bit of an add-on to question 2, but are all frontend frameworks/tools purely Javascript frameworks? Like Angular, Vue, React? I suspect it’s because only Javascript can run on the browser, in which case is this a good thing to only have one programming language dominate the scene?

4. I’ve deployed web applications before through Heroku, but I’ve never deployed a database. In fact, I’m not even sure that’s the correct term. If I were to deploy my React and Flask app, how would Postgres for example be running remotely on a server? Would this be done through Heroku?

5. How does platforms like Heroku make any money at all? I can create a free account and deploy websites for free (granted it’ll have the herokuapp domain), but doesn’t it cost money for them to have those servers running?

I might have more questions later but that’s all for now! I’ve been studying CS for 4 years now and I never quite got the answers to these. Any answers would be much appreciated!",1644680023.0

The above struct is 24 bytes wide on a 64-bit system, out of which 13 bytes account for padding. Reordering the fields of the struct in descending order of their alignment requirements reduces the size of the structure by 8 bytes.

struct foo {

slotas,Integrals and Floats: Is that it?,,3,0.62,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/slotas/integrals_and_floats_is_that_it/,7,"To represent values, it seems that computer scientists have settled that the only things they need are integral types that represent whole numbers (-1,0,1,2) and floating point numbers (.25, 10.0, Positive infinity, NaN). These come with modifiers for the size of the variable (eg int and long or float and double) and whether they are signed or unsigned (eg uint or int). 


After that, representations of any other mathematical object come from combinations of integrals and floats and the functions defining their uses. For example, a vector is a struct of floats that adds componentwise, can multiply with scalars by multiplying each element, and can dot product with another vector.


Why don’t computers support more data types? I know that there is specialized hardware for specific operations like FPGAs, but there are types that any computer should be able to use. 


I’m not an expert in hardware design or machine code, but I think that as an example, a “polynomial” data type could be used to reduce the size and increase the speed of many programs. 


A polynomial is an expression of the form “y = ax^b + cx^d …” To represent this with an array of bits, I suggest the following rules. I believe it should be possible to create circuits to support this. 


Starting from the right, add the length of a string of ones times x to the power of the number of 0s to the right of the string. 


As an example, here are the polynomials that 4 bits can represent with this system:


0000: 0

0001: 1

0010: x

0011: 2

0100: x^2

0101: x + 1

0110: 2x

0111: 3

1000: x^3

1001: x^2 + 1

1010: x^2 + x

1011: x+ 2

1100: 2x^2

1101: 2x +1

1110: 3x

1111: 4


It should be possible to create circuits that take an integral or a float and a polynomial and output an integral or float that the polynomial returns when called on that value. It should also be possible to create circuits that add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do function composition on pairs of polynomials. 


The polynomial rule I described above does not support negative coefficients, but that can be fixed with the rule that the coefficient is, where L is the length of the string of ones: ((L%2==0)? -L-1 : L+1)//2. 



0000: 0

0001: 1

0010: x

0011: -1

0100: x^2

0101: x + 1

0110: -x

0111: 2

1000: x^3

1001: x^2 + 1

1010: x^2 + x

1011: x -1

1100: -x^2

1101: -x +1

1110: 2x

1111: -2


This rule extends to larger strings of bits in an intuitive way. 


Variant ideas:
A type that multiplies all values by x to get rid of the constants. 


A type for floating point inputs that uses the inverse coefficient instead of the coefficient to better represent certain important infinite series including the Taylor series expansions of sin(x) and e^x.

sl4tdf,Why is natural alignment used in most processor architecture over processor-word alignment?,Discussion,27,0.93,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/sl4tdf/why_is_natural_alignment_used_in_most_processor/,5,"Most processor architectures prefer natural alignment as the default alignment requirement but I think that processor-word alignment is a more efficient alignment requirement that saves memory without any performance overhead over natural alignment.

For example, a double has an alignment of 8 according to natural alignment but on 32-bit processors it would have no performance overhead if double had an alignment of 4 and it would have saved memory. This [source](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf)#3.6.4 states that double has an alignment of 8 on 32-bit processors:
> Align 64-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of eight.

Similar examples can be seen in 64-bit processors, 16 byte sized data type(int128) has an alignment of 16 whereas it could have been beneficial to keep the alignment equal to the size of the size of a processor word(i.e. 8 bytes long in 64-bit processors).

My guess is that this standard of natural alignment was created because when data was read directly from the wire, the machines could default to natural alignment and not have to deal with different alignments of the same data type according to the cpu architecture of the sender of the data.

When all the fields of a data structure are being stored in a single CPU word, they still have padding inside due to natural alignment whereas I do not think that padding is needed when all the fields are stored in a single CPU word because any field of the structure would take the same amount of byte shifts to access it despite of where in the CPU word it is stored(please correct me on this if i am wrong).

For example, consider this struct:
```
struct example {
   char i; // 1 byte
   // 1 byte padding
   short j; // 2 bytes
   int k; // 4 bytes
   char l; // 1 byte
   // 3 bytes trailing padding
} foo;
```
The padding between `foo.i` and `foo.j` is not needed in my opinion because `foo.j` would still need 6 byte shifts to access.

To summarize my question, I want to know that what are the benefits of natural alignment over processor-word based alignment.

I also want to know that whether inserting padding inbetween the cpu word where all your data is stored any better over storing those fields without any padding. Also, does the position of fields in the same CPU word make any difference?

I find myself having a lot of trouble understanding the different ""types"" of optimization problems that exist.

For example, I understand the idea of optimizing continuous functions (e.g. y = x\^2) - for example, we could be interested in finding out the value of ""x"" that results in the smallest value of ""y"". I also understand that continuous functions can be optimized subject to some constraints.

However, I find myself very confused when trying to sort through the following types of optimization problems:

* **Discrete Optimization**
* **Integer Optimization**
* **Mixed Integer Optimization**
* **Combinatorial Optimization**

When I think of these problems, the first thing that comes to mind is that they are fundamentally different from optimizing continuous functions. For instance, the inputs of the above list of problems are usually ""categorial"" in nature - this is why I have heard that problems belong to the above list usually require ""gradient free optimization methods"" (e.g. evolutionary algorithms, branch and bound, etc.) , since it is impossible to take the derivatives of the objective functions corresponding to these problems.

For example, if you take problems such as **""Travelling Salesman"" or ""Knapsack Optimization""** (note: I have heard that these problems belong on the above list, but I am not sure), I would visualize the objective function as something like this:

&#x200B;

This leads me to the following question:

* Are 4 types of optimizations on the above list effectively the ""same thing""? The way I see it, all 4 types of these problems have ""discrete inputs"" and in a mathematical sense, ""integers"" are always considered as ""discrete"". In all 4 types of problems, we are interested in finding out a ""discrete combination"" of inputs - i.e. ""combinatorial"". Thus, **are 4 types of optimizations on the above list effectively the ""same thing""?**
* I have heard the argument that ""any optimization problem that can be formulated into a linear problem is always convex (because linear objective functions are always convex)"". If we consider continuous optimization problems - we usually say that ""convex optimization problems are easier than non-convex optimization problems"" because non-convex functions can have ""saddle points"" that can result in the optimization algorithm getting stuck in these ""saddle points"". Using this logic, I have seen the objective function of the ""Travelling Salesman Problem"" being written as a linear function and thus the ""Travelling Salesman Problem"" being considered as a convex optimization problem - I have also heard of the ""Travelling Salesman Problem"" is a very difficult problem to solve. **If the ""Travelling Salesman Problem"" is convex and difficult to solve - does this imply that there are non-convex discrete/combinatorial problems that are even more difficult to solve?**
* I have heard the following argument: Discrete/Combinatorial Optimization Problems are more difficult to solve compared to Continuous Optimization Problems. This is apparently because discrete/combinatorial optimization problems involve ""treating the problem as a continuous problem"" to first come up with a solution, and then determine if the solution lies within the feasible region - thus effectively solving two optimization problems in one. **Is this correct?**
* Finally, I have seen both ""Travelling Salesman"" and ""Knapsack Optimization"" being formulated as a linear problem and therefore as convex. **Are there any well known examples of non-convex discrete/combinatorial optimization problems?**

> Nanocomputing involves using nanoscale structures to make computing processes. Nanoscale structures like protein and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) can be used to produce nanocomputers.
> DNA computing involves using DNA, molecular biology hardware, and biochemistry to perform computing processes instead of the traditional electronic computing which makes use of silicon chips. Information in DNA is represented using a four-character genetic alphabet (A [adenine], G [guanine], C [cytosine], and T [thymine]), instead of the binary numbers (1 and 0) used by traditional electronic computers.
> When applied to separate and non-sequential tasks, the DNA nanocomputer is better than the traditional electronic computer as it can store a larger amount of data in memory and conduct multiple operations at once. DNA nanocomputers are considerably faster than their electronic counterparts.

So according to these articles, micro/nano computers in that sizes are really able to perform any tasks and store datas just like the traditional computers do or even better? And it is indeed possible with our current technologies that people can remotely re-program the system inside those computers, so the devices run by them can just switch to perform different tasks or move to specific environments, or upgrade itself indefinitely as the programmer desires?

Is it possible that they are even able to perform tasks of building/creating a specific object by using the chemicals and substances they collected form the environment like engineering robots do?",1643827073.0

For example, in C any non-zero value is True, so a pointer has the ""trait"" of being either true or false depending on whether or not it's null.

A `mod` type in Ada has the ""trait"" of being bounded between two values, and also the ""trait"" of overflowing to stay within those bounds.

This can allow you to express some very complicated things. The trait system in Rust allows you to say ""if I can do X, then I can do Y."" Using that, you can basically have behaviours ""implement themselves"" as long as there's a valid path through the trait implementations.

I found some of the [old writing](https://github.com/kind-lang/Kind/tree/f70ed05356f4d6e88f4d28df3d1ddb0a3cad8c94), such as the so-called [FMC Specification](https://gist.github.com/lancejpollard/afa755498c6590c821290dc2b24a588b#file-fmc_specification-md), which describes some of the theory. Some important snippets from it are (bold added):

>Within the field of type theory, mathematical proofs and theorems are represented by functional programs and their associated types. This is called the Curry-Howard correspondence, and is the basis of modern proof assistants such as Agda, Idris, Coq and HOL/Isabelle. Sadly, those are complex software with monolithic implementations that are hard to audit and reason about. We're interested in a simpler alternative: a fully-featured proof assistant that can be turned into a small standard that is easy to analyze and implement independently.  
>  
>Under that perspective, one may be interested on the **Calculus of Constructions** (CoC), a small type theory that **easily fits 1000 lines of code** in a modern programming language. Sadly, that and similar languages **aren't capable of deriving mathematical induction**, an important proof technique without which any non-trivial theorem isn't provable. Moreover, it isn't capable of expressing efficient (constant space and time) pattern-matching, without which functional programming isn't viable. The usual solution to both problems is to supplement CoC with a native datatype system, but this results in the complexity explosion that is seen on the mentioned languages.

The same author made this [Calculus of Constructions repo in JavaScript](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/calculus-of-constructions/blob/5b4ede47dfcc408ce27903f78d29c81bf393a9d3/src/core.js), but it seems to have been replaced by KindLang.

So then it is stated:

>**A simple, clever alternative was proposed by** [Aaron Stump](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/). With just one additional primitive, the ""**self type**"", **coupled with mutually recursive definitions, one can easily derive induction** for lambda encodings, i.e., a way to represent datatypes with native lambdas, subsuming the need for a separate implementation. This also solves the efficiency problem, as we're able to pattern-match in constant time with certain lambda encodings. The problem with that solution is that providing a semantics and, thus, proving the consistency of the resulting system becomes extremely hard.  
>  
>Aaron Stump **moved on from self types towards a very similar solution based on dependent intersections**. The idea is that, instead of relying on mutual recursion, inductive datatypes can refer to themselves in simplified, erased forms. This results in a comparably small language that is much easier to provide a semantics for, which Aaron Stump called Cedille-Core. In exchange, programming on it is hard. The simple task of defining a datatypes with efficient pattern-matching and recursion becomes a complex task involving non-trivial type-level manipulations and many intermediate proofs. While doable, programming in Cedille-Core without a supplementary language to do all that work for you is not practical.

Then it talks about ""consistency"" being a problem when modeling, which is a bit over my head. Then:

>Computationally, Formality-Core is just the lambda calculus.

Meanwhile, the latest KindLang [THEOREMS](https://github.com/kind-lang/Kind/blob/master/THEOREMS.md) doc describes how to prove things. Haven't read through all of that yet, though.

What I'm wondering is, what is the summary of the theory KindLang is built upon? What I shared above is pieced together.

I found this by landing on the [Calculus of Constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions) (CoC) after looking at the [Lambda Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube). I found that from looking at [HoTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory) and [UniMath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univalent_foundations), both of which are touted as ""foundations of math"". (UniMath is based on Calculus of Constructions as far as I understand). But as the above snippets show, CoC cannot model induction or recursion I guess, so I wonder how these can serve as foundations. So it looks like KindLang builds upon CoC like UniMath, but adds that ""self type"" that Aaron Stump talks about. *Does it add anything else?*

I was reading about [Cubical Type Theory](http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory) (doesn't even have a Wikipedia page yet), but it was said it also had some key problems, and then landed on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11479.pdf) which states right up front:

>We prove normalization for (univalent, Cartesian) cubical type theory, **closing the last major open problem** in the syntactic meta-theory of cubical type theory.

*Maybe I misread that though.*

So I am wondering, what theory does KindLang use, and how does it relate to Cubical Type Theory, which seems to be the latest edition of Type Theory that is the most expressive.

> The jargon for this is that basic C types on x86 and ARM are self-aligned. Pointers, whether 32-bit (4-byte) or 64-bit (8-byte) are self-aligned too.

Now, he says that the data types are self aligned on x86 and ARM processors and pointers are self-aligned on 64-bit architectures too. Self-alignment means that data is stored at a memory address which is a multiple of the size of the data type of the data.

My question is that is data aligned according to its size(self-alignment) or according to the memory access granularity of the processor. There are hardly any cpu architectures which allow data types larger than their memory access granularity, so even it won't make a great difference if some data is self-aligned or aligned according to memory access granularity of the processor.

It would be great if you could specify some cpu architecture that allows data types larger than its memory access granularity. If self-alignment and alignment according to memory access granularity do not practically make a difference at the memory level, won't it still be better to say that data is aligned according to the memory access granularity rather than self-alignment.",1642775959.0

Think about cellular life. Biologically, for many organisms (think simple multi cellular; plants, things that don’t have super complex brains) we understand the structure and function of literally every single atom and cell that they are made of. But we are unable to synthesize these organisms we know so much about ourselves in a lab despite knowing how to perfectly verify nearly every piece of their structure by looking at them. 

Translating to the P=NP problem, the “verification” of a problem can be thought of as examining every single piece of an organism and confirming that it is what we think it is. The “solving” of the problem would consist of creating such an organism from scratch, from non-living material. Despite knowing how every single piece of a multi cellular organism works and being able to verify them, humans cannot solve them by creating them in a lab. 

What is the only current known way to “create” life? By waiting for nature’s random iteration to try and fail over billions of years and trillions of “guess and check” iterations. If evolution can be thought of as the only way to achieve the “solution”, until we can figure out a way to synthesize complex multi cellular organisms from scratch, nature’s answer to the P=NP problem is that verifying a solution does not imply that it can be solved. Only guessed and checked over trillions of years.

This may not make sense but I think it’s an interesting way to think of how nature sort of answers one of humanity’s biggest questions.",1642652810.0

> Even if P≠NP, the O(nW) complexity does not contradict the fact that the knapsack problem is NP-complete, since W, unlike n, is not polynomial in the length of the input to the problem.

`W` is the max weight capacity.
`n` is the number of items.

Why is `n` polynomial in the length of the input? 
If the input is binary, `n` is definitely exponential in the bit length.

Also, for problems in NP, we can verify them in polynomial time. However, here for a polynomial time algorithm in the numeric values `n` and `W` for knapsack, we still call knapsack NP-complete because of the length of the input. By the same logic, wouldn't the algorithm to verify a solution to knapsack **not** be polynomial (pseudo-polynomial) - and so, it's not even in NP?

If anyone has an idea of a better place that I can ask this question that would be excellent.

The problem :  I'm playing a game called Scam \*cough\* I mean Star Citizen and there are many large 3d worlds to explore but no coordinate system yet.  It does, however, give you the distance in kilometers you are from given hubs on said world as well as the center of the planet itself.

The hair brained scheme:  
Step 1 - take screenshots of the planet from X km away at each pole and then again from a few angles around the equator.  
Step 2 - stitch those together onto a 3d sphere to create a mapped globe  
Step 3 - take screenshots of interesting locations by flying to a certain altitude and looking straight down.  Then try to find software that can look at the screenshot and match it with a given location on the globe

Some problems I'll face:  
\- the screenshot will be a 2d image of a sphere and so will need to be reshaped as it cant just be put on as a skin ( there is a better mathy way of saying this right? something something projection? but im making sense yeah? )  
\- The planet will have lighting and cloud cover which change and could be confusing to any ML Algo.  
\- Mapping locations to the planet might be difficult as the planet may be too 'samey'.  A second option is to record the distance one is from several WP on the planet and use that information to, i believe the word would be, ""triangulate"" the position? yeah? Does that sound right?

This sounds very possible to me but might require some specialized ML magic that I'm not educated on? If anyone has any advice for how to better approach or frame the problem, or potential solutions for software or math that can be used to solve this, I would be stoked :)

In case it's relevant I'm fairly competent with JS and Node

🔵 Singular Value Decomposition 🔵

🪄 Remember from the [post on eigenvectors](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ruf6eq/what_is_an_eigenvector_a_2minute_visual_guide/): eigenvectors of a matrix are special vectors that only get scaled when the matrix is applied to them. While EVD (eigenvalue decomposition) can only be applied to special matrices (diagonalizable matrices) SVD is a generalization of EVD and can be applied to any rectangular matrix.

🧩 Like prime factorization where a number is broken down to its prime factors (simpler pieces = prime numbers in this case); SVD factorizes the matrix into simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices. This factorization or decomposition comes in handy for many applications some of which I briefly touch upon later.

🏥🦴 Time for (somewhat of) an analogy: You can think of SVD as an x-ray of a matrix. It provides us with simpler pieces that constitute the matrix and by looking at these simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices we can say a lot about the matrix in question. Things like its (pseudo-) inverse, rank, null-space, range among other things can be easily determined the same way a doctor can say a lot with an x-ray scan of your body.

🔨 The Singular Value decomposition breaks the original matrix into 3 pieces: 2 unitary matrices and a rectangular diagonal matrix. You can draw a parallel with the Eigenvalue decomposition equation and see exactly how SVD has a more general form.

🔄 With the help of the Singular Value decomposition we can explain what happens to an arbitrary vector when a matrix M is applied to it. Since M can be broken down into simpler pieces, we can represent the matrix M by a rotation, followed by scaling (by the singular values) and another rotation. So if you had a circle it would first be rotated then stretched by the singular values (becoming an ellipse) and finally be rotated to end up as a rotated ellipse.

🗜️ There are numerous applications of SVD. Perhaps you could comment on the ones that I missed but you know about. One of the nicest things you can get is the pseudo-inverse of a matrix without doing crazy matrix inversion. This is because the simple pieces that SVD provides are extremely easy to invert making inversion of the original matrix child's play. SVD is heavily applied in solving numerical problems such as solving linear equations that so frequently pop up in engineering.

🎥 Data compression and computing low-rank approximations make it handy for compressing images and videos so you can watch cat videos without buffering. And of course, SVD has also been used for ranking web pages like Google's Pagerank algorithm does so you can find your favorite recipe with a quick search.

s67zoq,Question about the correctnes of an algorithm,,2,0.75,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/s67zoq/question_about_the_correctnes_of_an_algorithm/,4,"**Problem statement:**

>Write a function, which creates a random graph of a certain size as follows. The function takes two parameters. The first parameter is the number of vertices n. The second parameter p (1 >= p >= 0) is the probability that an edge exists between a pair of nodes. In particular, after instantiating a graph with n vertices and 0 edges, go over all possible vertex pairs one by one, and for each such pair, put an edge between the vertices with probability p. The graph representation is an adjacency matrix.

**Proposed algorithm:**

    1- Create a bool matrix (2d nested array) of size n*n initialized with false.
    2- Run a loop over the rows:
      - Run an inner loop over the columns:
        - if row_index != col_index do:
            - curr_p = random() // random() returns a number between 0 and 1 inclusive
            - if curr_p <= p: set matrix[row_index][col_index] = true
              - For an undirected graph, also set matrix[col_index][row_index] = true
    
    **Note:**
    Since we are setting both cells (both directions) in the matrix
    in case of a probability hit, we could potentially set an edge 2 times.
    This doesn't corrupt the correctnes of the probability
    and isn't much additional work. It helps to keep the code clean.
    
    If you want to optimize this solution, you could run the loop
    such that you only visit the lower-left triangle (excluding the diagonal)
    and just mirror the results you get for those cells to the upper-right triangle.

Now, someone told me that without the optimization the algorithm is wrong since it calculates the propability of edge existence twice.  In their words:

>With the current code in the undirected case, the probability that matrix\[0\]\[1\] will be set is the probability that the random number in the iteration with col=0/row=1 or in the iteration with col=1/row=0 is smaller than p. That probability is 1-(1-p)\^2.

&#x200B;

At first I thought they were right, but thinking more about it it occured to me that since the random number generations are independent of each other and since we don't need 2 false (or 2 trues) to set or unset an edge, the probability calculation of the algorithm is correct. If their argument was correct, it would be like saying when you throw a 6 on a 6 sided dice, your chances of getting a 6 next time are less than 1/6. In other words, it looks like the [Gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy) on their part.

&#x200B;

I hope I've managed to convey the problem and arguments in full. If not, please ask.

What I'm looking for is feedback on which argument is correct. Thank you very much in advance.",1642436886.0

And then if your network learned the game correctly, a human could give it input with their controller and it would return a close approximation of whatever game state the original game would have given.

- computers come preset with instructions on how to boot the OS located in the ROM. Once this takes place the OS controls the remainder of operations. 
- when you plug your computer into the wall, electrical signals are sent in clock cycles that run at some frequency all the time, either idle or active. These signals are always looking for data to transfer via the bus to read, but they are essentially always running (this is the part I'm shaky on I think) 
- when you write and compile a program say hello world, you have organized some high level code into what can be translated into machine code and binary. When you executed this is sent to the ram, where the clock frequency (always looking) activates logic gates based on what was sent, and tells you what the output it.
- if you wanted to use an embedded controller to run a motor the same applies where the programmer writes readable code which can be converted to binary, and is sent to the pinouts in such a way that causes some actuation to happen (such as alternate pulses to a stepper motor)

🔵 Gradient descent 🔵

💾 A more detailed post this time but I wanted to make sure I touch upon some basics first before diving into gradient descent itself. This is mainly so that it is more inclusive and no one feels left behind if they have missed what gradient is and if you already know what it is you get to brush up on the concept.

🏃 Although a relatively simple optimization algorithm, gradient descent (and its variants) has found an irreplaceable place in the heart of machine learning. This is majorly due to the fact that it has shown itself to be quite handy when optimizing deep neural networks and other models. The models behind the latest advances in ML and computer vision are majorly optimized using gradient descent and its variants like Adam and gradient descent with momentum.

⛰️ The gradient of a function is a vector that points to the direction of the steepest ascent. The length or the magnitude of this vector gives you the rate of this increase.

🔦 Time for an analogy: it is nightfall and you are on top of a hill and want to get to the village down low in the valley. Fortunately, you have a trusty flashlight that helps you see the steepest direction locally around you despite the darkness. You take each step in the direction of the steepest descent using the flashlight and reach the village at the bottom fairly quickly.

📐 Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the parameters of a function. It uses 3 critical pieces of information: your current position (x\_i), the direction in which you want to step (gradient of f at x\_i), and the size of your step.

🧗The gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent but because we need to minimize we reverse the direction by multiplication with -1.

🎮 This toy example illustrates how gradient descent works in practice. We compute the gradient of the function that needs to be optimized i.e. the differentiation of the function with respect to the parameters. This gradient gives us the information we need about the landscape of the function i.e. the steepest direction where we should move in order to minimize the function. A point to keep in mind: gamma the step size (also called the learning rate) is a hyperparameter.

🔵 Parametric and non-parametric statistics 🔵  


🧑‍💻 If you have written code before you have heard of a parameter. It is what a function takes as input to do some computation on and return an output. Similarly, probability distributions have parameters. These define the properties of the distribution.  


🔔 In the case of a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are its parameters. The mean controls the position of the distribution while the standard deviation controls the spread or ""peakiness"" of the bell curve.  


⛷️ In the parametric approach, the model consists of a finite set of parameters that characterize it. The big assumption that a parametric model makes is that the model will do well on the task if the underlying distribution from which your data is sampled matches the model. If that is not the case the model and data mismatch will hurt the performance on the task you care about.  


🤸 A non-parametric model does not rely on parametric assumptions and is generally more flexible. It is a good choice if you don't have any prior knowledge about what could be a good model that reflects your data distribution. A histogram is a good example that can model points sampled from an arbitrary distribution.  


🧐 However, there is no free lunch: you will need enough data points to get a good approximation otherwise the histogram will look nothing like the underlying distribution.

🔵 k-means Clustering 🔵

🔱 The k-means algorithm divides N data points into K disjoint clusters. It is a well-known unsupervised learning model. This means that the k-means algorithm only requires the data points and does not need the corresponding cluster that each point belongs to as this is what the algorithm figures out.

✨ The clusters are found by allocating points in such a way that the total variance of the points within each cluster (intra-cluster variance) is reduced or minimized. Although it iterates quite fast, the k-means algorithm can have varying cluster formations based on the initialization. It has been widely implemented in many software packages. The scikit-learn package for python is the one that I have used most often.

🔁 The most common method to perform the clustering is iterative. It alternates between two steps: (1) assigning each point to a cluster based on the point's closeness (or distance) to the cluster center and (2) updating the cluster center (called mean or centroid; hence the name k-means one for each of the k clusters) based on all the points that belong to this particular cluster. The iterations are usually performed until the centroids stabilize (converge) between consecutive iterations.

🤓 K-means is popular in scenarios where the data is known to consist of multiple groups (distributions) but it is unknown which point belongs to which group (cluster). It can be used for data analysis and splitting data that comes from multiple distributions, image segmentation, color quantization among other things.

1st and 2nd are about making copy of a line of characters and incrementing binary value.

🔵 Eigenvectors 🔵

🚀 An eigenvector is a special vector associated with a linear transform. It's special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.

🔨 Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.

🔭 The word ""Eigenvector"" comes from ""eigen"" in German where it means ""its own"". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.

🎭 Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\_1, ..., E\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\_1 + 55% of E\_2 + 35% of E\_3). Each eigenface would represent a meaningful feature in the high-dimensional space of faces.

Okay.  But where does this memory location number come from, and why/how do we actually access it?  

Say we have our memory as 5000 bytes of data, in 1D.  My understanding is that each byte in memory has its own address, but I don't understand the mechanism for how.   I understand that it's like a ""house address"" and we need it in order to find a value stored at a given location.  But at the most basic level, where are these addresses coming from? The hardware? Or is this just something we are adding to that byte of memory (sort of like metadata in Numpy arrays)? If that's the case, then does this not take up some of the memory? 

E.g. we have a memory location of 13413241 let's say.  Where is this value stored? I would assume that all the memory locations, all these integers, are inherent to the computer we are working on, and thus always exist.  Is this entirely separate from ""memory"" in terms of how big our program is (if they always exist anyways)?  It just seems like we can pull these memory addresses out of thin air.  If I define say `x = 5`, is it always the case that I have also implicitly defined `some_pointer = &x`, and is this now in my program's ""memory""?   Unless the memory location is not ""bundled"" to that 5, I don't see how the pointer ""knows"" the memory location.  Maybe all of this is happening at the hardware level and I'm too focused on the software level.  I haven't found any articles that explain what I'm looking for, only what a pointer is.  Maybe this is more of a question about what the `*` and `&` operators are actually doing.

It might be evident already, but I almost exclusively use Python.  In Python, we can define a variable, which will always be equal to some object, and then we can set that variable equal to other things, namely we are just telling that variable to now ""point"" at a new object: but the previous object still exists in memory, it just isn't referenced.  However, my understanding is that Python doesn't actually have pointers, so my understanding may be tainted pretty heavily by the Python id() function which returns the location in memory, and also by how variables and objects interact in Python.",1641325885.0

I have been wondering about this for a while now, but how come the Installer of a software is sometimes much much lighter than the software itself? As I understand it, the concept of an installer generally is to compress the necessary files for a software, and then distribute the files in the PC + configure whatever settings required to operate the software (add registry records etc.).

But sometimes the weight difference between the installer and the software is really big, like several GBs big, and for games it's sometimes up to a couple dozen GBs even when the installer is an offline one (as in does not have to download extra data in order to finish).

I don't see how these variations can be achieved using conventional compression, especially when the compressed files are not simple textual data.

Am I missing some key point in how installers work? Is it really just simple compression and decompression? Am I just exaggerating the weight differences?

In this problem, you are required to match the real names of basketball players to their nicknames, and sort the basketball players by their heights. Normally, this problem would require you to manually enumerate different combinations of names-nicknames and names-heights, until there are no contradictions according to the conditions below.

&#x200B;

I was wondering if these kinds of problems can be solved by brute force using programming languages such as R.

&#x200B;

For example, the code below lists every possible combination of basketball players by height:

    
    my_list = c(""Bill"", ""Ernie"", ""Oscar"", ""Sammy"", ""Tony"")
    
    d = permn(my_list)
    
    all_combinations  = as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(d), ncol = 120)) |>
      setNames(paste0(""col"", 1:120))
    
    
    data_frame_version = data.frame(matrix(unlist(d), ncol = length(d))
    
    matrix_version = matrix(unlist(d), ncol = length(d)) 
    
    #first 20 rows of matrix version:

And this code below records every possible combination of name-nickname:

    
    list.a <- as.list(c(""Bill"", ""Ernie"", ""Oscar"", ""Sammy"", ""Tony""))
    
    list.b <- as.list(c(""Slats"", ""Stretch"", ""Tiny"", ""Tower"", ""Tree""))
    
    result.df <- expand.grid(list.a, list.b)
    result.list <- lapply(apply(result.df, 1, identity), unlist)
    result.list <- result.list[order(sapply(result.list, head, 1))]
    
     head(result.list)
    [[1]]
       Var1    Var2 
     ""Bill"" ""Slats"" 
    
    [[2]]
         Var1      Var2 
       ""Bill"" ""Stretch""

    ""Bill"" ""Tree"" 
    
    [[6]]
       Var1    Var2 
    ""Ernie"" ""Slats"" 

The way I see it, the two objects (""matrix\_version"" and ""result.list"") should contain the right answer to this logic puzzle - I just don't know how to extract the correct combination from these two objects such that the logical conditions are respected.

Can someone please show me how to do this?

I have a hard time picturing how the CPU instructions, the operating system, and applications work together.

What I mean by that is the following, we have an application that is compiled, now it's converted to CPU instruction (I guess ??), but then this app is using system calls to interact with some I/O devices, how does this system calls go through the OS? And if it's just an instruction that invokes an OS function that makes that system call, what prevents the application from calling the I/O directly or ""hacking"" that function by pretending it's another process ( as an example a process reading data from a socket owned by another process).

&#x200B;

\#Rule 1.

\*You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time.

Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and

put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 2.

\*Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even

then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 3.

\*Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is

usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know

that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n

does get big, use Rule 2 first.)\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 4.

\*Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and

they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as

well as simple data structures.\*

&#x200B;

\#Rule 5.

\*Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data

structures and organized things well, the algorithms will

almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not

algorithms, are central to programming.\*

&#x200B;

\*Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim

""Premature optimization is the root of all evil."" Ken

Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as ""When in doubt,

use brute force."". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the

design philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by

Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often

shortened to ""write stupid code that uses smart objects"".\*",1640663682.0

How does these search engines work around that to handle these cases ?

He claims that the delete-minimum operation for the priority queue when implemented with a balanced search tree will have O(log n) time complexity. But, I disagree with that statement IF the nodes in a balanced search tree have a parent node field. Because since we have a pointer to the minimum it takes constant time pointer manipulation to unlink the minimum node and since the new minimum node will be the parent node, setting the pointer to the new minimum also takes constant time. Unless my assumptions on how a balanced search tree is misguided (I assume a balanced search tree is functionally equivalent to a binary tree, except its self-balancing process), then the delete-minimum operation should have O(1) time complexity.

    We employ predicate abstraction [35] but without the usual
    conversion to boolean programs. Our approach is similar to
    that of Flanagan and Qadeer [32] where two transformers are
    alternated: precise symbolic transformers to handle individual
    commands, and an imprecise transformer to ensure convergence.
    In contrast, classic abstraction applies an imprecise
    transformer at every step. Hence, we call the precise/imprecise
    approach delayed abstraction.

They have done cloning. I can’t understand this method. Is this a valid method of testing a SC because we are modifying the SC. Can we modify the SC during testing?

The paper says:

    Reentrancy in Solidity can happen via the call method. send only invokes the default function with limited gas for logging purposes. ZEUS handles same-function reentrancy by first cloning the function under consideration, and inserting a call to the clone before the invocation to call. Fig. 14 shows the patched function for the example in Fig. 2. Note that ZEUS ensures that the patch is done within the same basic block so as to ensure that if the cloned function is called, then the invocation to call is also made. Further, we also assert false before the call code. If the verifier finds a path leading to this assert, it indicates a bug.

I am failing to understand that how do we access the consequent fields of a struct with just the memory address of the first field. We can do it in arrays by jumping x bits ahead according to the data type of the array, we can only do this in arrays because the values in a certain array have the same data type.

I have more of a technical background rather than a CS one so this is my thinking when approaching this:

Because he's taking each integer in the array and brute force testing it against all other integers in that array and then moving onto the next integer if there is no match, the algorithm will take exponentially more time as the array size increases and therefore has a time complexity of O(n^2).

For example, an array with 2 integers will have 4 (2^2) total pairs: 00, 01, 10, 11,

While an array with 4 integers will have 16 (4^2) pairs: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111

* Experiments as code: Track meta-information in the repository and version it like code.
* Versioned reproducibility: Save and restore experiment state, and track changes to only execute what's new.
* Distributed experiments: Organize locally and choose what to share, reusing your existing repo setup.

Experiment versioning treats experiments as code. It saves all metrics, hyperparameters, and artifact information in text files that can be versioned by Git, which becomes a store for experiment meta-information. The article above shows how with DVC tool, you can push experiments just like Git branches, giving you flexibility to share experiment you choose.",1639048353.0

I can simply change the value of `age` directly because I have access to it as I am changing from the same scope.

A reason I could think of for creating a pointer to a variable in the same scope is that it might be useful to have pointers point to a variable in the same scope because it would make the naming easy and referencing to the value in huge codebases would be made easier, but I do not think that this is a good use case. 

The main purpose of pointers is to stop the wastage of memory by copying of the values stored in a variable to another variable but if we are creating pointers, we are of course storing them in a variable which is taking memory so we are back to square one. This might not be the case where variables store a lot of data, this is true for variables that store less data than the memory address itself.

RANT-- Skip to TL;DR if uninterested

Like if you already have a function that perfectly describes your algorithms time complexity, what's the point in simplifying it in a weird way that breaks algebra rules? If you're trying to compare it to another algorithm, then why not just... compare it to another algorithm? Grab two functions, from two different algorithms, come up with some reasonable input sizes, and evaluate. Simple as that. But then there's this best case worst case thing? And I don't get how what comes out of the definitions is the best or worst case... The way that O(n) was defined to me just made it seem like any arbitrary function that was larger than f(n) could suffice in defining the worst case scenario...

r5yufr,Why might changing process priority and forcing a single CPU thread to focus on a program improve the stability of that program?,,57,0.97,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/r5yufr/why_might_changing_process_priority_and_forcing_a/,22,"This is kind of a specific question but, I formulated it in the most general way possible so anyone can benefit from any answers.

I have a very lightweight visual novel video game called *Shiny Days*. For some reason, the game runs just fine with minimal bugs in windowed mode. However, when in fullscreen mode, the game will freeze at a very specific moment in the game every time without fail.

The fix for this endorsed by the community is to change the process priority to ""Above Normal"" and change the processor affinity to only ""CPU 0"" or ""CPU 1."" This is to force the program to only use a single thread.

&#x200B;

The question I am asking here is, why does that fix work? Why would increasing process priority and limiting the program to a single thread help anything? I know what the fix does but, I don't get why it stops the freezing of the program in such an effective way. What do you guys think is going on here? I'm curious to hear any insights computer science experts would have to say on WHY this fix actually works.",1638310213.0

I've been reading about sockets and how to write server programs using socket libraries like winsock or socket.h, but I am kind of confused about how the server then talks with other programs. I think the best way to explain it, is for me to lay out what I THINK is happening when a simple GET request hits an HTTP server.

Assume a client and server socket are already connected using TCP.

Data Arrives to the network interface for the machine, the driver for network interface card tells the OS that it has data (through an interrupt?). The OS then looks at the IP:Port# and if there is a connected socket listening with that IP and Port, it then (through the socket library) passes the data to the process that is the ""server"". The server has the payload with the HTTP headers, metadata, body, etc. Now lets say I have written an API using C# using the webapi framework in dotnet. Does the server open a socket with the process running the API in order to pass the HTTP request info to the correct endpoint? Is the server and the API the same process, and the dotnet framework (or any API framework) is baking in the socket code and acting as a server as well? or is it something I'm completely missing?

&#x200B;

Let me know if this makes sense at all. Please correct and incorrect assumptions or missing steps in my walkthrough. I'm trying to remove as much abstraction as possible and understand how something like this works at a low level.

r4xo16,Liskovs Substitution Principle Question,,5,1.0,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/r4xo16/liskovs_substitution_principle_question/,10,"My question is about why LSP requires contravariance in the parameters of the subtype's inherited methods.

And more to that, if following LSP means that I can pass in a subtype wherever a parent type is expected, then why couldn't the inherited methods of the subtype be covariant in the parameters?

Does the fact that you can't be more specific when passing parameters to a subtype's inherited methods itself violate LSP?

Edit: Thanks to u/Probablynotabadguy I think I understand this.

If you have a type T and a subtype S, then for all intents and purposes, S IS a T.

And so of course the substitution portion holds that if you have a function `foo(T)` that you should be able to pass in an S - because we just said an S IS a T, right?

That part I understood. However, because anything provable of type T should be provable for type S, that includes it's methods. And so the contravariance of the subtypes methods is precisely because it's trying to preserve the provability of the subtype relationship.


My apologies, I know that's probably a lot of the same words.

The only problem is, if your stages dont divide neatly into your instructions and leaves a remainder.

For example a 3 stage piplined CPU with 8 instructions, will initilise as such:

You subtract the triangular number of 3 from the instructions: 8 - 6 = 2

And that is how many instructions will be carried out while the program is operating at full efficiency, so you can divide the 2 by the number of stages you're operating at any given time so 2 / 3 = ...

Oh... rem. 2?

Trying to visualise what happens this is my best guess at the answer:

We can't expand so far, on the 0 being off and 1 being on, so to introduce colours into fibre optic we could essentially assign colours a number to achieve different out comes.

First of all, I'm sorry if this post can be a little bit confusing, I'm trying to gather all I have understood so far to make it as clear as possible.

So, I am attending a Logical Networks class, and we started some days ago talking about sequential circuits. Today, our professor introduced us to synchronous and asynchronous circuits, but not in the same way I found online.

He introduced them by saying this:
Basically an asynchronous circuit is a circuit that whatever the state and the input (q1,I) you consider, will always end up in a steady state (qn, I), where if you keep I as an input you'll keep staying in the qn state.

And, contrary to this, he told us that synchronous circuits are circuits where not all states and inputs have this property.

So what does that specifically mean? I struggle to understand the concept, as some of the example he gave us for synchronous circuits (one of them was a machine that was able to recognise if there was a 101 sequence in the input) seemed to have the steady state property I talked about before, so I think I might be missing something.

That said, he then explained us that for that reason (not every state with an input I will end up in a steady state) we need an external synching (a clock) and a memory to make a state steady. Why is that? And why don't we need that for asynchronous circuits?

Lastly, he talked about how some of these machines need just an impulse or a longer signal to work (and for example an asynchronous machine cannot recognise a '00' input as it operates when an input changes, so it can only tell that the last input was a (for example) 1 and this one is a 0). How do you tell that? 

Hope this was clear, thank you for everyone who chooses to spend their time to help me understand :)

Oh and, don't take my words for something so accurate of what our professor told us, since I am trying to rephrase these things from what i have understood.",1636757693.0

I know it's electric currents flowing through transistors at the lowest level.

I know you can run compiled programs.

But where is the transition layer from one to the other ?

For example, Intel creates a CPU and I write a program for it, let's say in Assembly. I write the command: mov eax, \[ebx\] .

Who translates 'mov' into what it actually does and who knows how to interpret that command ? Is there a dictionary somewhere that says mov in binary is 0011010010011 (made up obv) and when you encounter that string of binary code you perform this function ?

Even more, how can this be hardwired onto a CPU ? Is mov a physical circuit that gets called whenever that command string is encountered ?

Sorry for the avalanche of questions but this particular topic is very hazy to me. I can't picture how a written command can direct electric current down in the CPU to do certain things.",1636426967.0

Should I use some optimization algorithm or something or is it easier than that?

**Edit (to add maybe a more accurate description of what I'm searching for):**

Parameters:

I) collection of sets

II) n - size of group to consider

III) (Optional) - list of elements

Output: which n sets from collection should be selected in order to maximize unique elements (if parameter III is given, consider only elements from that list) considering all sets from collection.

**An interesting case I think worth mentioning** (made me wonder it might be optimization problem and not a brute force that would check for set with more unique elements and go next for  set with more unique elements disconsidering previous added):

Set 1: {A,B,C,D,E,F}

        i = j-1
        while i > 0 and A[i] > key{
            A[i+1] = A[i]
            i = i-1
        }
    A[i+1] = key
    }

CLRS gives the first loop invariant saying that A\[1..j-1\] are in sorted order.  But I'm not entirely convinced that's the case from a mathematical standpoint.  Intuitively looking at an example it is pretty clear that A\[1...j-1\] is in sorted order, but I'm wondering what could be the loop invariant for the inner while loop, since I'd assume its why the loop invariant CLRS gave holds.  Not the most useful question from a practical standpoint but I really like math and am curious what the loop invariant is for the inner loop.  Also not sure why CLRS would leave it out.

qjk2pi,How do you even solve programs?,Discussion,2,0.6,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/qjk2pi/how_do_you_even_solve_programs/,3,"I have recently passed my algorithm course where I learned about 15 algorithms. 

My professor has suggested me to solve problems in online judges. Now that's where the problem begins.

When I was in the course, the processor would provide exercise related to a topic he had just taught. So every time exercises were given, I knew which algorithm it is relevant to. But now when I pick a random problem from an online judge I'm lost. I don't know what algorithm might it be relevant to, I can't write a single line.

I was kind of ahead of my class in some of the programming courses but now I'm losing interest in programming because I can't identify the algorithms needed to solve problems. Should I give up programming(which will be a disaster)? 

Any suggestion on getting out of this situation? Sometimes people say ""keep practicing"" but it's not helping. How can I even keep practicing if I have to look up the answer of every problem I pick?",1635663479.0

qiu1wc,Programming Languages are overrated,,0,0.37,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/qiu1wc/programming_languages_are_overrated/,12,"I have been thinking about this from a long-long time and thought of sharing this here. Programming Languages are given a lot of importance than they deserve in the programmer community. I have seen a lot of people flexing that they know x number of languages which is incredibly shameful. Most of the programmers(90%+) would always give programming languages a lot of importance. Programming languages do not matter much. 

The core concepts of programming matter a lot more than programming languages but still a lot of people want to learn more and more programming languages. Senior software engineers know this that programming languages don't matter as you can learn a programming language thoroughly well in a night if you know the concepts well. By concepts I mean all the things that are applied while making a product(e.g. a web app), if you know compiler design, it would be incredibly easy to grasp a language, that is where concepts pay off.

This problem's cause is bad platforms and bootcamps but I would not name them. They teach the programming language and nothing else. That does not pay off as you might get a freelance job for 10$/hour but you won't be able to land a good 100k+ job at a good company. And I won't even like to call you a programmer if you just know the programming language.

You actually get the taste of core concepts when you go to get a CS degree from a formal college. Yea, I hear you saying that ""Duh, I can't go to college"", then learn it yourself. I myself am 14, started to program seriously since 13 and I can't go to college too. So I started learning the concepts myself. I do not know a lot of programming languages and I just know JavaScript that too not to a great level but I have come to learn system design and databases pretty well and I can make a web app easily. 

Programming Languages are just a way to implementing our programming thoughts, it is just a tool. Just like english is a language to express our thoughts about philosophy, science, etc. Do tell me your thoughts about this, I would love to read them.

Instead of writing a program, the program writes itself over time, based on your needs. The logic gates assemble themselves after getting a base neutral network from a trainer.

Building off of that theory, processors can be much more like the human brain, taking input data, and learning to route the output to the appropriate place, while learning what output is to be expected.

In this scenario, a single piece of hardware could theoretically become whatever it was needed to be, in the same way software defined radio works.

The above digital logic diagram is a logical circuit with feedback. The combination logic unit is an accumulator (with the '+' on it).

This fixes the problem. To preface, I am familiar with registers on a software level and had an internship doing reverse engineering so I conceptually understand how registers work. In this example, how does a register help? How does it add the control? How does it make it so that s is initialized to 0?

I would appreciate this a lot.

EDIT: Solved

Summary as to why the register

I understand registers on a software level. I've interacted with them a lot when I had an internship doing reverse engineering. But, I've wanted to up my knowledge so I'm resisting the digital logic implementations of them. I digress, but it was to illustrate I have somewhat of an idea of what I'm doing.

The reset signal from the register is sent indicates the end of the loop.

As for the initialization, the load signal indicates to replace the state of S. In other words, initialize S.

So, to recap:

The register does the following ( slight over simplification):

1. CLK = State Change
2. LD = Initializes
3. Reset = Control",1634858345.0
