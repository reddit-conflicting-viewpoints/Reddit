Two slices of pizza is a healthy choice compared to the whole pizza.",,525,0.97,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t7fezt/mcdonalds_fries_are_a_healthy_choice_compared_to/,74,"This may seem obvious to some of you, but it took me a long time to finally realize this. One of my biggest things with weight loss/eating healthy is this all or nothing attitude.

I used to think if I really want a Chick-fil-A sandwich, I'm being unhealthy so I should get my normal meal complete with the fries & soda. When we order pizza, I think I'm already being unhealthy, I should get the cinnamon sticks & too. And pizza is so good with Coke, so I should get that too. I leave feeling like total shit about myself, usually eat way too much & eventually end up going back to my old ways of eating crap all the time.

I've finally learned that a meal doesn't need to be all healthy or all unhealthy. It's completely acceptable to get the nuggets with a side salad & unsweet tea. Or get the nuggets on a salad. I can order pizza, but I can do a thin crust with veggies & skip the cinnamon sticks & soda & not eat the whole thing in one sitting. I can go to Starbucks, but I can do a smaller size & less sweetener than normal. And I can get one mini scone instead of a big one or 3 minis.

When I make these healthiER decisions, I still get my treat & I walk away feeling proud of myself instead of like shit or like I failed. And it's actually something I can do for the rest of my life compared to never eating french fries or pizza again.

Edit: idk why this needs to be explained. I‚Äôm not saying eat fries as a your meal. How healthy/unhealthy fries are or if they‚Äôre more or less healthy than a burger isn‚Äôt relevant. I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre craving fries & going to McDonald‚Äôs to satisfy that craving, you don‚Äôt need to add on a bunch more unhealthy stuff just because you‚Äôre there. If you‚Äôre not that hungry or have food at home, you can just order the fries. If you‚Äôre hungry for a meal, you can get the fries & something more nutritious for the entree instead of saying I‚Äôm already eating an unhealthy side so I‚Äôll get an unhealthy entree & drink too.",1646504375.0

23lbs down since Jan.1 so far! All CICO and lifting! I've never felt happy dieting like this before. I've been heavy since hs but lost it (lost 20kg in 6 months to a lower end of normal BMI) before the pandemic hit. I did a combo of 20:4 IF then and 24 hrs fasting. It was HARD. I was so unhappy because i was barely eating and my head ached ALL THE TIME. Gained everything back during the pandemic lol. Now with CICO i get to eat my happy food (chicken) all the time and even eat sweets like ice cream by the end of the day and still be below my calorie restriction. I learned how to cook too! I barely felt any hunger these past 2 months!

One of my friends ‚Äùthe skinny athlete type‚Äù about a month ago told me that she actually started running using the app, and she told me it does really work. So I gave it a chance even though I was really skeptical.

Downloaded the app and put on my sportswear then I tied my running shoes and went out the door. I chose the ‚ÄùFirst Run‚Äù named 20 minute run and started running. 

I can humbly announce now that this freaking app does work. The most important thing for me is the coaches. They are really motivating and they give you the boost you need FOR FREE?? On my first run I started crying in the middle of my run. Coach Cory made me cry for joy even if my feet ached, I felt proud to be me and to be running. 

I have been running 3 times a week and today I did run 3.5km first time ever in my life. I felt like i was gliding through the jogging paths, felt like I was alive. I feel proud and I can tell you that I fell in love with running, and I hope this motivates someone to get up from the couch. 

I started with zero running experience and now I am this far already within a month. My next goal is 5km.

I had given it an honest effort in the past,  and I stayed the same size. And I really did give it an honest effort. So I figured... impossible, I'd have to starve myself to lose weight.

I also decided I would TRACK everything so he couldn't tell me I wasn't trying hard enough. So I bought a fitbit and started tracking and measuring what I was eating. Not only would I prove it was impossible, I'd have the data to prove it.

When I started losing weight I was actually surprised. Between September and Christmas I lost 16 lbs. I gained 6 lbs back during Christmas.

Previously, I had a lost a ton using a homebrew weight watchers plan. But then I stopped and didn't have a plan and gained it all (and more) back. Last year my sister started Noom and I briefly joined her. We have both since decided it wasn't for us, but it did galvanize me to actually try again with some changes.

First, I learned about my TDEE and set my daily calorie goal for a sustainable number for me (1800). I'm not losing quickly, but I know I can eat around this number for the rest of my life and be happy. I also don't track on weekends. I know that's a controversial take on this sub but the break gives me a mental reset each week that I think really helps with the long-term sustainability of keeping to 1800 calories. I've also noticed that I've started binging a lot less on weekends as I'm getting better weekday habits.

I also started weighing in daily and logging it in Libra. I keep a close eye on my trend weight than the day to day and that also helps keep me from stressing about the day-to-day fluctuations.

My next step is to start back at the gym and lifting some weights and doing cardio 3 times a week before work. I loved when I did that before and it's time to get back into the habit.",1646488488.0

I saw on barbend that your ""floor"" should be 0.7g/POUND of bodyweight for cutting or muscle gain, and like... besties, I'm 133lbs, you want me to jam *93 grams* of protien into my body every day?

I don't eat meat most days (not vegetarian, just don't like it) and I'm 5'4, so my tdee and therefore my deficit cals are pretty low... what am I supposed to do? have a protien shake with every meal? Omad a kilogram of tofu? Eat five dozen eggs for breakfast every day, like Gaston?

What is the *most efficient* way, in terms of calories and just sheer physical volume,  to get the equivalent weight of several songbirds in protien?

I was easily the biggest person in the gym for years. I was embarrassed and scared that people would be watching me.

Eventually I got more comfortable there, and literally only a couple times I got a comment from someone at the gym, which were positive. 

The one I really remember was a bodybuilder who came up to me and said ""hey man, just want you to know that I've seen you around and you're doing a great job."" I was filled with encouragement to know that someone who looked as glorious as that guy thought I was doing a good job. It boosted my workout confidence for months!

But now that I'm much more fit than I was, whenever I see someone who is as large as I used to be, my heart wants to provide encouragement to them because I've been there. I know what they're going through.

Then my head reminds me how I thought that everyone was watching me and how self conscious I was. And so I don't say anything, ever.

I usually want to say ""Hey, I used to weigh over 500 pounds. You can do this. Feel free to say hi anytime"" or something similar. I want them to know that they have an ally that understands.

I don't know if making a comment would help or hurt. I'd love to get more opinions from this supportive community. 

I don't want to single out the biggest person at the gym and make them feel more self conscious than they already are, but I so badly want to make sure they have support because I know how hard it is.

I started my weight loss journey in July last year with a program in my area.  It was a low calorie plan but a doctor oversees it so I thought it was okay.  I lost a lot of weight quickly and it worked so well that after the first four month session I signed up for another.  It started to get harder as I lost weight and became more active.  I was always hungry!  I started feeling nervous about this, especially when I mentioned wanting to work with a personal trainer and the program tried to discourage me because they thought it would slow my weight loss (yikes).  But they helped so much in the start, so I tried to keep them happy even while I went ahead with my own exercise plans.

By January I had lost over 100 pounds and started seeing a trainer but also tried to keep close to the program‚Äôs recommended calorie limit.  My annual physical in December showed my protein levels were low so I started basically living on protein shakes and drinks and meat because how else do you get 150-200 grams of protein per day when you‚Äôre only eating 1000 calories?  The program was happy I was losing weight, my trainer was happy I was making progress, I thought maybe I was getting away with it.

By the beginning of February everything fell apart.  I started feeling really dizzy in the mornings and it slowly increased through the day.  My Apple Watch started giving me alerts that I was experiencing bradycardia.  I dropped out of the weight loss program because I didn‚Äôt need the stress, and I went to my doctor who said I was dehydrated and needed to stop all exercise and push electrolytes.  She did an EKG and a Holter monitor, and the sinus bradycardia was consistent but no other problems showed up so she‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm just still dehydrated.  I went to see her yesterday to ask for more tests.  It‚Äôs been over a month and I‚Äôm having trouble doing my job because I‚Äôm so dizzy and weak.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting enough nutrients even though I‚Äôve increased my caloric intake to 1200-1500 per day, but I‚Äôm so dizzy and nauseous I‚Äôm never even hungry any more, so eating is a struggle.  My doctor told me that I‚Äôm overeating and will gain back all the weight and I should be eating 800-1000 calories.  She said there‚Äôs no point in doing any more tests and I need to continue eating few calories and if I‚Äôm still having trouble in another MONTH to let her know.  She made me feel really guilty for eating 1500 calories; from her reaction you would think I told her I‚Äôm eating a large pizza a day!

This is crazy right?  I‚Äôve used TDEE calculators and even with my current body fat % around 40 my BMR is much higher than 800 calories.  I really think my problem is that I haven‚Äôt been getting enough nutrients but my doctor seems to think it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm eating too much.",1646497681.0

There are so many people on this site showing how their discipline and determination breeds amazing results. But I don't know how to be that person.

I am beyond frustrated with my complete inability to get control of my obstacles. I'm not obese but I have been overweight and unhealthy my whole life. I want to be healthy, to look healthy, to have good habits, to be confident, but I can't get there.¬† 20 lb has been my first goal for decades and I cannot get there.

SUGAR

I am addicted to sugar and have been my whole life. The cravings are too powerful for me to ignore and so i seek it out, often hiding it from my family. I communicate to my wife not to bring bad food into our home and she's pretty good about that. But she also knows that sweets make me happy so sometimes she'll bring me something. Or I'm at a party and I just can't control myself. Sometimes I say no to social occasions because I know it will ruin my diet for the week. But I'll probably ruin it anyway so I don't know what to do.

¬†CALORIES

I have become a decent cook in an attempt to get control of it. I meal prep. I try not to have bad food in the house. I try to eat at a caloric deficit and I do 5/7 days of the week. In fact I've been eating in a caloric deficit for years at this point. But I'm still binge eating and that offsets the progress. It's common for a cheat meal to turn into a cheat weekend or cheat week or a cheat month. I know it's happening when it's happening and I can't control it.

EXERCISE

I know that getting control of nutrition is the most important part. But I hoped that developing a habit of exercise would help and I put a lot of effort into it.

I got into running years ago and did it a lot. I ran multiple half marathons. But I hate running, and generally dislike exercising, so it didn't stick. I pivoted to weight training which had the benefit of being able to do it year round but that's when I discovered that my body cannot handle it. Leading into...

MEDICAL ISSUES

I'm constantly hurting myself and unable to maintain any sort of progress. I have had three personal trainers work with me for many years. Each of them started thinking that I was making it up or just untrained, but soon they each came to realize that there's something wrong with my body. One of them said that he's worked with car accident victims who improve faster than I do.

I've been to many doctors and they can't figure it out, although one of them thinks it could be an unidentified autoimmune disease. I've been trying to figure this out for 8 years progress. I have a good sense of what I can and cannot do and just try to keep movements to a low level and a low weight.

While I am managing it in a sense, it doesn't go away, and it's a notable barrier. I'm still working out at home using body weight and dumbbells but my routine must be limited or risk injury. I try to walk a lot because it's low impact but it's actually one of the more painful activities. I went for a long walk with a friend last weekend and I was in pain the whole week following.

SO...

What do I do?

I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do. Last night I went on a huge binge and this morning I got up to work out I could only do half my workout because of pain.

I'm clearly unable to set goals and follow through. I'm unable to maintain discipline or get control of my cravings.

I've tried exercise programs and trainers and nutritionists. I've tried it on my own. I know all the information, I know what needs to be done in order for people to be successful. I just can't execute it, with or without help.",1646494010.0

No time expectations at first, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I worked up to 30 minutes. The next two habits I added were for my mental health. I started laying out my clothes the night before, and I began getting up with my husband at 5am. After 2 months I feel a lot better and have way more energy! And I'm really happy with that. BUT...

t7hu63,An honest update,,3,1.0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t7hu63/an_honest_update/,3,"Hi! I am the OP from that one post 8 months ago. I am shite with figuring how out how reddit works with hyperlinking, but you can find it in my post history.

A couple people poked me so here we go. 

Obviously, 8 months is a long time so I'll try to summarize things as succinctly as I can. Obviously this will come off as a massive oversimplification. 

First thing is first: I did not lose any weight. I know. The stats on that post remained unchanged. Unfortunately. Except I am one year older. 

I mention in my last post that I intended to count calories... and I did, on and off, for the whole time. The problem was, I never found it sustainable. I could never stick with it for longer than a week at a time at most. I would find myself so hungry, and binge at night. There were days I cried in frustration. After I sort of resigned myself to the fact that calorie counting isn't working, I did not know where to go from there, calorie counting sort of being the gold standard of weight loss. I kind of fell back into just eating intuitively.

That being said, my desire to lose weight remains unchanged. I just don't know how! I thought I did, but i don't! Where do I go from here? How does one build sustainable new habits? It feels insurmountable! Weight loss is hard. For those of you who have conquered it, I admire you. 

I want to wrap up by saying that I am not angry or resentful with myself. That wouldn't do me any good. I'm a big believer in forgiving yourself and moving on, lesson learned. I also wouldn't say the entire 8 months was wasted--many amazing, fun, sad, emotional, happy, melancholic, all the things, things happened in my life during that time period that had nothing to do with my weight. Also, it's never too late to turn around. Even the people who are 3, 4, 5, 600 pounds. 

I should also mention that since swapping birth control methods, my blood pressure is almost always normal now, which I'm very happy about. 

Please be nice in the comments, I hope I can be lauded for my honesty and not shirking from that post instead of smeared for failing. Obviously, sharing something like this is quite scary; I won't lie, if there is a lot of negativity ill probably delete this post. I also want to thank everyone for the engagement on the previous post. Y'all are awesome.",1646511343.0

30/F/5‚Äô10‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know the point of this post, but I just find myself at yet another goddamn crossroads with my weight and I‚Äôm so fucking tired of feeling like my entire life has been centered around this ONE part of myself that I have tried so hard to work at, and have consistently messed up time and time again.

I‚Äôve been ‚Äúbig‚Äù for as long as I can remember. I had to shop in the adult section of the store since 2nd grade. I was kicked out of ballet class in 3rd grade because my teacher wanted me to wear a girdle to perform on stage for ‚Äúher company.‚Äù By the end of middle school my mother and I had done Weight Watchers, South Beach Diet, Curves for Women, Atkins, and probably a couple others. My weight always went up and down. I didn‚Äôt have friends growing up because I was constantly teased - my first real friend was in 7th grade. 

I reached my HW as a teenager when I was 14 - 280 lbs. My dad died when I was 16, and my weight just plummeted. I stopped eating. I got down to 170 lbs, the lowest weight I‚Äôve ever been, because I just stopped eating. Then I went to college - by the time I graduated I was back up to 240 lbs. Then I moved to NYC and went to graduate school, and my weight climbed up to 310 lbs by the end of my first year teaching. My fianc√© died at the beginning of 2017 and my weight was down to 210 lbs by the end of 2020 - and now I‚Äôm back up to 270 lbs from the stress of returning to in-person teaching. 

I feel like I‚Äôve missed so many milestones of my life just because of my weight. Normal dating. Friendships. Travel. Taking risks. Being who I really am as a person. I don‚Äôt want to be approachable because it‚Äôs just barely starting to be OK to simply exist as being fat in our society - but only if you‚Äôre happy, only if you‚Äôre friendly. You‚Äôre not allowed to be fat and mad; you‚Äôre not allowed to be fat and angry. And I‚Äôm pretty goddamn fat and pretty goddamn angry. 

There‚Äôs always some cure. Some advice. Some feedback. But none of it works for me. Crisis makes me lose weight. I‚Äôve been to SO many therapists ever since I was a young kid. I KNOW why I binge eat, I just can‚Äôt stop. I can‚Äôt keep ‚Äúbinge foods‚Äù in my house because I will eat all of them and not portion them, but then if I deprive myself of them it is disordered and I will ultimately end up binging anyway. I can‚Äôt take long walks because I‚Äôm already walking about ~4 miles a day as a teacher and my feet hurt by the end of the day because of my PF, and ever since I had covid back in January my head hurts and feels like it‚Äôll explode if I even so much as bend over to tie my goddamn shoe laces - so something as simple as restorative yoga feels impossible. I visit doctors and I‚Äôm not taken seriously, it‚Äôs just ~eat smaller portions~ and I‚Äôm taken as a goddamn joke. I‚Äôm already on Vyvanse to help control my appetite, but it doesn‚Äôt do shit. 

I‚Äôm just fucking tired. This shit runs deep in my family; offhand I can‚Äôt name one woman that hasn‚Äôt struggled with her weight out of my immediate or extended family. I don‚Äôt want to have biological children for the fear I have a daughter and she goes through this same anguish in her life. I‚Äôm just so, so, so fucking tired. And I don‚Äôt want to deal with this shit any more. 

I‚Äôm really at the point where I just want to keep eating and eating until I‚Äôm over 1,000 lbs and hope that I die before I‚Äôm 35 years old.",1646486253.0

- She's been eating an average of 1200 calories a day during that time, now recently averaging 1000 calories a day.   I'm worried her daily intake is too low.
- She exercises at the gym (90 minutes) 3-4 times a week.  
- She's in her early 40s, 160cm (5'3),  57kg (125lbs) now, 58 (128lbs) kg when when started 4 months ago.  Truthfully she's led a very inactive office worker's life + unhealthy diet before she started.

She's been trying really hard these days, eating mainly chicken breasts, eggs, sweet potatoes, cabbages, apples, nuts etc.  

Any advice would be great. Thank you.

Edit : wow, this post blew up a lot more than I expected.  First off I want to say Thank You! to everyone who contributed awesome advice here.  And I want to say sorry I couldn't reply back to everyone.  

1.. Maybe I slightly stated wrong what her goals were.  Imo, i think body recomposition is her main goal, especially waist/hips/thighs/arms areas, and losing weight is her secondary goal.  Just becoming a more healthy person is her third goal.

2.. I agree and realize more so now eating 1,000 or less calories a day for her is far too low and in fact could be detrimental.  We are planning to talk to a professional trainer or professional nutritionist next week.  

3.. I agree more muscle building fits her long term goals more than just calorie burning cardio.  Again we hope to talk to a professional soon.

4.. Just want to make it clear i did not force her do this and have tried to convince her not to over exert herself.  We are in a good place relationship wise and i often tell her her appearance does not factor into my commitment.  I admit i might have lacked in the verbal encouragement department, but I'll try improve upon that.  Also I'm planning to be cooking a lot more often for her.

5.. The reason main reason I've posted in her place is she doesn't do reddit and she's not a native English speaker.  She only knows Korean & Chinese.  I've read her all the replies here though and have posted some replies for her.

Just wanted to aay thank you again to everyone here.",1646439497.0

Many cycles of bulking and cutting to no avail. I still look like fat. I get no muscle out of it on my routine. I used to do PPL but nowadays i do 5/3/1 but i don't see any big difference. So far my lifts are as documented in my paper notebook: bench press 82kg for 5 reps, pullups for 10 reps. Barbell row standing is 81kg 5 reps. Hammer curl dumbbell 15kg 10 reps. Regular curl is 10kg 8 reps but i always do those at the end so i could probably do more if i wanted to max it out for documentation. Deadlift is going good at least at 120kg but i keep being afraid of snapping my shit, same with squats. I can do about 5 reps of ab wheel rollouts but it's hard to apply progression to those really unlike a barbell.

My goals used to be to lift 1/2/3/4 but i have loooong given up on that, at this point i am very content with achieving a lean look. I don't really care about lifting big anymore. God please just let me be lean for 1 summer. I promise myself every year that this summer i'll look somewhat lean but every year i fail i always look the same as the picture i posted despite either cutting or bulking.

Oh and my length is 185cm and weight that i am is 85kg. I do not skip workouts and i follow the routine. I push as hard as possible on my lifts. The bench press is a life and death struggle getting it up which is wicked cool.

t6pejm,Address your mental health before trying to actively lose weight (my experience),,183,0.94,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6pejm/address_your_mental_health_before_trying_to/,23,"We all know that the formula for weight loss is simple- CICO. There's different ways you can eat to accomplish this, but ultimately that's it. 

But, we also know that losing weight is incredibly hard. Many of us have gotten to our highest weights because we don't have a good relationship with food. People (especially those who have never been fat), tend to overlook the emotional and mental aspects of weight gain/loss. 

So, this is my plea to you: before you even start counting calories, seek to address the mental and emotional aspects of your eating habits. Whether you have a diagnosed eating disorder, mental health disorder, substance use disorder, or are an emotional eater. 

For me, I've always relied on food a way to cope with stress and emotions such as loneliness or sadness. It started during university, which was incredibly stressful and led to me eating bags of chips and candy while studying. In December 2020 I was at my highest weight, at 260lbs due to bad habits during the pandemic. I was living alone and felt so isolated and sad and I hadn't seen my family in a year (and was spending Christmas alone), so I would regularly eat an entire pizza and a bottle of wine to make myself feel better. 

In 2021 I tried losing weight by counting calories, and was able to lose a few pounds but I didn't take any steps to address my mental health. So, I would eat healthy and under my limit most of the time but then still do these crazy binges anytime I had a bad or stressful day where I would order a ton of food, which would outdo my good diet. 

In late 2021 I decided something needed to change. My mental health was at an all time low (I also suffer from anxiety and panic disorder) and decided to seek professional help. I have been working with a therapist for several months now and have also re-started medication for my anxiety. 

Part of what I am learning is to find better ways to manage my stress, and to reduce my anxiety overall, so a small stressor doesn't push me over the edge. I also have better coping mechanisms so I am not as likely to eat a ton of food to make myself feel better. It hasn't been perfect, I have had slip-ups, but overall, I feel like my relationship with food is changing. 

Now that I am in a better place emotionally and mentally, I've started counting calories again and am seeing slow, steady weight loss. I'm continuing to work on my mental health and relationship with food. 

From my own experience, if you try to ""diet"" or reduce calories without addressing your mental health or disordered eating, you are setting yourself up to fail. You will continue to rely on food to address your emotional needs. You may respond to a restrictive diet by binging. You may get discouraged by slow weight loss or plateaus and give up. You may have an eating disorder that is triggered by counting calories. Note, I'm not saying to ""fix"" your mental health first, as it is a lifelong journey, but to start addressing it before you go hardcore into diet mode. 

I realize that therapy can be expensive but you may be surprised to find free or low cost options in your area. Fellow Canadians, here are a couple free resources (I'm sure your country has similar):

SORRY long post ahead. Just to provide background info but jumping into my main issue.

I am new to this sub. I have lurked here and there seeing all the success stories and it's inspiring seeing so many people accomplish their goals or are close to accomplishing.

About Me: Currently, I am a 30 year old Male, weighing about 220lbs and I am 5'6.5-5'7.

I used to be in shape for most of my life until senior year of college. I ballooned up to 205 lbs when I graduated and moved back home. I dropped 25 pounds back in 2014-2015 to get back in shape thanks to staying at home, using nutrisystem, and running on the treadmill everyday. When I graduated from grad school back in 2016, my weight slightly increased. But the past few years due to a stressful job, and issues my weight kept increasing. I am a stress eater at times and I typically pick the heavy meals to make sure I wouldn;t worry about being hungry. My body gets a bit panicky when I am hungry. Fast forward to late 2021, I came in at my highest of 230 pounds. I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea (OSA), part of it was due to genetics from my dad's side (he has it as well). I had sleep issues for a few years, always waking up early or having some form of heartburn. It was just in 2021 where I felt immense fatigue and decided to get to the bottom of it. Luckily the cpap has helped with that.

Anyways, I tried getting in shape with the peloton and trying to reach 10k steps with my fitbit, but my eating habits are bad. I always felt hungry after breakfast. My breakfast before this new journey consisted of eggs and a bagel. Other would be oatmeal or kashi cereal. Here's where my story begins.

After I turned 30, I reluctantly I tried this weight loss program from my doctor because I got annoyed/hurt my parents keep mentioning my weight issues and I needed to make a change.  Myy doctor is known\` for having this program to help you lose weight and lose weight under supervision. Typically I don't see my doctor often, but he always says I am healthy and did not feel the need to prescribe a blood test or anything. The program he runs is a calorie deficit program where you would eat 1,200 calories, low carb, focusing on meats and veggies. So I eliminated, bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, all the good comfort foods in life. He would give us phentermine to help suppress our appetite along with other supplements such as b-12, calcium-magnesium, fiber, etc to keep feeling full. They provided us with a scale to track your weight daily so when you go to your check ins, they have the data to see your trend.

I started the program early October of 2021. After the first week, taking half dose of the medication and following the diet, I lost 5 pounds. I started after having issues  the second week. I felt really tired and had bad stomach pains early in the morning since  I was eating little than I was used to. Those stomach pains would go away after I eat something. I mentioned this to my counselor in the program but she said to monitor and did not mention it to the doc. Over the next few weeks, my weight loss was slowing, I thought measured portion properly but I was not seeing results. Sometimes the weight would fluctuate up and down. The program made me feel pressured because you can lose 2-5 lbs every week and when I did my weekly check-ins the counselors would act disappointed if you did not lose at least 2lbs loss/week. I got nervous around them, my blood pressure was elevated, and heart rate was high in the doctor's office. (my vitals are normal when I am home, I check every day). 

And so, I made a terrible decision. I started fibbing the numbers on my scale. I started showing I was losing weight at the pace they liked, but my pace was taking a long time. My weekly check-ins turned into weekly calls because I am working in tax season as an accountant and I can't find the time to spend 30 mins at the office. I fibbed the numbers so much that it showed I lost 38 pounds within 5 months when at most I only lost 10 pounds. I tried my best to lose weight at quicker pace (ie. eat more veggies in my meals), exercise, but nothing worked. 

It came crashing down last night, when my parents asked me to weigh in front of them. When they saw the true number, they were disappointed upset I did not do anything before. Now that the cat is out of the bag, i need to tell my counselor the truth. I feel terrible for all of this and I know I am gonna get heat and deservedly so. I am sorry to all the people out there who trying to achieve their goals but I felt disrespected everyone in the process.

I need as fresh restart, but I am stuck back to square one and feel, embarrassed, and lost. I am not sure this current program is for me and my doctor is pretty apathetic saying he got good reviews, so it's a you problem. Any advice, insight, comments would be greatly appreciated.",1646505582.0

My mum got married in November and, while I loved my dress and actually felt good on the day, when I look back at pictures I'm embarrassed and disgusted. I have a photo of the whole family on my desk so I see it everyday, luckily I'm on the end and use another photo to cover myself out of the image.

Overall, I want to lose about 100lbs but I want to do it in a healthy way that I can stick with for life. And I know this is not possible by September. 

I don't drink much alcohol, once or twice a month I'll have a few beers or some wine. I'm trying to cut out soda and am down to 1 diet pepsi a day. I usually stick with water, sparkling water, and tea.

I love fruits and veggies. But I also love pasta and bread, I have switched from white to whole wheat for both but I know it's still not great.

I also have the occasional binge, something I've been dealing with for years. Yesterday was 3 pieces of Popeyes fried chicken, onion rings, poutine, biscuit, and a hand pie. I felt so shitty, both physically and mentally, I went to bed right after at 7:30.

I find that I'm really good at starting but after 5 or 6 days I fall right back into the crap. 

I am on multiple medications that affect weight but by losing weight I would be able to completely stop some of the meds and lower the dosage on other ones. 

I'm also super sedentary. I know excersice is a big proponent of weight loss so I'm trying to start walking more, but usually my daily excersice consists of walking from bed to couch to kitchen. 

I would appreciate any advice people have, or even just supporting and encouraging words as I'm feeling really down right now.

I am also approaching my period, but that has never caused a weight increase before. Can 3kg really be just water weight from a few days of lots of carbs and no exercise? Or could stress do this??

For context: I‚Äôm 24F and have lost 30lb in the last 3 months. Fairly healthy diet with low carbs and high protein and veg and regular exercise.",1646495159.0

I have been frustrated as I haven‚Äôt really seen any changes (and I don‚Äôt own scales due to previous disordered eating), so I‚Äôve been trying to go off of the fit of my clothes and any physical changes.


After the photo yesterday, I thought I saw a slight difference, and put these two photos together. It may just be me, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm starting to see results, even if only in photos rather than the mirror.

t7iev5,Need help adding 1000cal to my diet,Question,1,1.0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t7iev5/need_help_adding_1000cal_to_my_diet/,1,"I've been on a bit of an extreme diet to clean and jump start my current regimen.  But I need to add 1000 more calories to it so it will be sustainable.  My current diet is taking 1lb of lean ground beef, a packet of microwave jasmine rice and a handful of spinach mixing it all together in a single pan and splitting it up 3 ways to cover 3 days worth of meals.  I only eat once a day and this is something I couldn't change if I wanted to.  Once I eat I am no longer hungry for the rest of the day no matter what I eat or in what amount.  If I calculated it out right my current meal is about 200-250 calories.  The entire pan wouldn't be much more than 600-700 and I really don't feel like eating a pound of ground beef a day.  

So any idea where I can find an extra healthy 1000 calories that won't be inconvenient to add to a single cook day.  I really like only having to cook once every 3 days and I like that it only takes about 10 minutes to cook.

And yes I have been keeping up with micronutrients with some really good quality multivitamins and I drink on average 120oz water a day.",1646513036.0

Title says it all really, I train with her (I‚Äôm 22, I think she‚Äôs like 20/21) on Mondays and Wednesdays. She messaged me Wednesday a few hours before our session saying she was ill and if we could rearrange, and i replied immediately saying I can do Thursday or Friday. It took her over 24 hours to reply to my message (she was active on her insta story though, where I messaged her) and she said she can do Friday. I saw her on Thursday at the gym (she happened to come in as I was leaving) and we agreed we would see each other Friday (today). 

So yeah, she hasn‚Äôt turned up and she isn‚Äôt answering her text or phone. She posted on her insta story about 20 mins before our session was meant to start about her taking a shot of creative before the gym. Thing is, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a different gym as she goes to a different gym sometimes. (Now I know for sure it‚Äôs a different gym as I‚Äôm in the gym area and she isn‚Äôt here) 

I was always going to work out today regardless of a PT session, however I did have to rush out the door for it as I had a bit of work to finish before leaving. 

She is young and fairly new to PT and I always give people the benefit of the doubt, but it is a bit annoying and I don‚Äôt know how normal of a mistake this is for PT‚Äôs to make or if it‚Äôs a complete no-no.

Also I have autism so sometimes a change of plan like this (especially this one as I wasn‚Äôt made aware she forgot/wasn‚Äôt coming) can sometimes stress me out and throw me off a bit. She doesn‚Äôt know about this though, I never told her in our consultation as it‚Äôs not relevant to my fitness goals.

Update: she just posted on her Instagram story her cheat meal (think she‚Äôs out with her bf) but she still hasn‚Äôt responded to my text or my missed call.

Update 2: it‚Äôs been 5 hours now since we were meant to have our session and she still hasn‚Äôt responded, in that time she‚Äôs posted 2 Instagram stories and an Instagram post. For context, we first started talking on Instagram and then earlier this week she gave me her number as she said she is more active on WhatsApp. When she messaged me about not making it on Wednesday she said that on insta and I replied on insta, but after not hearing back from her for over a day I whatsapped her. Today I messaged her first on WhatsApp, then I called her, and then after seeing her Instagram post I messaged her on insta asking if we were meant to have a session today.

t6zdv9,I want to be taken seriously,Vent/Rant,24,0.85,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6zdv9/i_want_to_be_taken_seriously/,28,"I tried expressing this to my partner today but they didn‚Äôt quite get it. Hoping you guys might understand and can offer up your experiences (and hope).

I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight over the last three years, going from 125 lb to 213 lb. Over those three years I tried, and failed, to lose significant weight and keep it off.

I had a lot of hardships late 2021, deaths of loved ones and new health issues of my own, which changed my perspective on mortality and how I want to spend my life, however long it might be. I started again Jan 27th and have tracked every day since. My partner sees my NSVs and how much healthier my eating has become.

But nobody else does.

It‚Äôs hard to explain that, without something to show for it (visible weight loss), I‚Äôm just some fat chick eating salad instead of someone serious about their health. They won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm healthy unless I look it.

Why it matters to me is that family and coworkers have said some thoughtless comments to me. They weren‚Äôt meaning to be unkind but it does hurt me. I want to be treated just neutrally. I feel self-conscious about eating and my weight, I feel I have to apologize or explain constantly. Like, I can‚Äôt casually go shopping at chic clothing stores on a whim.

My Dad is always pushing new weight loss pills on me. I always refuse because I know they‚Äôre scams. He also doesn‚Äôt realize his diet isn‚Äôt the pinnacle of health (*everything* is sugary or coated in sugar, even meats). I want to prove to him I can do this on my own. But until I can visibly lose significant weight, he‚Äôll think I‚Äôm failing.

My Mom low-key got excited when she learned I weighed more than her. Not because she lost any but because I‚Äôve gained. I know her comments originate from a bad relationship with her own body and weight ‚Äî she was just self-deprecatory when I was thinner and now she feels free to be deprecatory about my body. Maybe because she thinks I feel the same way about my own body now. She‚Äôll point out that a dress gives me ‚Äúbutt back‚Äù or that she doesn‚Äôt think I can lose my boobs. She looks at me and she sees flaws and she just has to point them out, like I don‚Äôt know.

We recently saw my partner‚Äôs sister and we all were celebrating together and eating the same stuff, but it was only me who got asked something along the lines of ‚Äúdo you normally eat like this (in ref to the heavy meals)?‚Äù Like... it‚Äôs normal if you‚Äôre an average weight to eat more than normal, but it‚Äôs somehow wrong that someone who needs to lose weight can also indulge. I can give her a break because maybe I misunderstood and she hasn‚Äôt observed the changes I make when I‚Äôm *not* celebrating. Like, I didn‚Äôt drink alcohol and was eating literally the same meals from the same place ‚Äî I was still tracking those celebration calories! But she doesn‚Äôt get that even if it wasn‚Äôt healthy, it was *healthier* compared to what I‚Äôd eat before I started tracking!

Then there‚Äôs my coworkers. They‚Äôre ok, but I feel like a lot of what I do is comedy to them. It seems it‚Äôs the things that wouldn‚Äôt be as funny if it weren‚Äôt a fat person doing them? They often take secret candid photos of me and post them to the group chat, and I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs *because* I‚Äôm fat, but I‚Äôm the only one who gets teased over the ‚Äúbad moment‚Äù faces or poses I‚Äôm in. I don‚Äôt think it would bother me if I wasn‚Äôt fat though because I‚Äôd know it isn‚Äôt that. I worry that being fat makes people assume about me rather than judging me for who I am.

I don‚Äôt know. Being taken seriously is so important to me, I absolutely have to keep trying. I also want to improve my health (fitness, gut health, nutrition, etc). My partner says that‚Äôs all that matters, regardless of what the scale or another person says, but... I just want to lose to prove to people I‚Äôm not full of shit.

Do you understand this? That I‚Äôm not just the obese person I was even a month ago, but no amount of healthy eating or walking will matter until months down the line when I can actually *prove* I‚Äôve been doing all that?? Until I can say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 20 lbs‚Äù if someone questions me or until someone notices a change, it doesn‚Äôt really feel...  valid.",1646447461.0

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 21 male SW 240 and CW 230 GW 185.

My doctor told me health wise I‚Äôm 30 pounds overweight and could stand to lose that much, but my goal is 185 since that‚Äôs how much I weighed 2 years ago when I was the same height and it was a good weight for me. 

I have been working out and dieting for about 9 days now and I‚Äôve shaved off 10 pounds, though I know a lot of it is water weight. 

I‚Äôve read about 1-2 pounds a week being the recommended weight loss, but I have also read on health websites and even from posters on this sub that it is common to lose 4-6 pounds your first couple weeks especially if you have a lot of excess to lose. I also understand it starts to plateau after those first few weeks and slows down. 

My main question is how much is reasonable for me to lose in the next 6 weeks? Going by 2 pounds a week I know that it‚Äôs 12, but is 15 unheard of? 20? I have a lot of excess fat to lose and I‚Äôve cut my calories in half and just from experience I tend to lose weight quickly if I‚Äôm trying.

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

And I've realized... I'm constantly eating. Pretty much non-stop. The moment the food from the last meal has been digested, I need to eat more. It's like I can't sit still with an empty stomach for more than a couple minutes. I think it started five years ago or so, when my anxiety was really bad. The only way I could make it stop was by overeating to the point where I was so full my brain could only think about how full I was. It was like a 5 minute relief from the anxiety.

Few years back I suffered from level 2 obesity and I started working out 3 times a week with a personal trainer. My muscles grew but fat was going down very very slowly (my fault party because I did not really count calories and had a strict diet)

When Covid came gym was closed and I have tried Ketogenic diet and lost about 28kg in 5 months. After that I started working out again (3x a week) and eat normally. About half year later I gained 4kg of muscle and 4kg of fat. So to prevent gaining fat I have started cycling (2 weeks ago) 4-5 times a week, started counting calories so that I am mostly in deficit or at least to have same input as output, but instead of loosing weight I am gaining weight (0.5-1kg in 2 weeks), that would be alright if it would be muscle while loosing fat, but I literally don't see a difference on my body. 

I feel like my body is unable to burn fat when I give it some carbs.

Doctor is telling me that everything is alright, my trainer tells me that I have good progress. But somehow I don't see it (I see the muscle growth but not the fat loss). 

Any suggestions? Is there anyone with similar issue and were able to solve it?",1646481808.0

Your body protects your muscles from the strain by retaining water and, once your body adapts to the exercise, the water weight comes right back off. Don't be discouraged!

Edit: If you still want to see if you're losing weight, try getting some measuring tape and measuring yourself. It's what I did and it was nice to see that, even if the scale wasn't moving, my waistline had shrunk by 2 inches in just that first week of high intensity training.",1646367748.0

My current diet & exercise routine - I have a set of dumbbells and a treadmill at home, and I use these 2-4 times per week. I'd say closer to 2 or 3 most weeks if I'm being honest. I do about 30 minutes of weight lifting with the dumbbells using a simple routine I found online and then I'll run about 1-2 miles on the treadmill. I use a foodscale to weigh everything including oils & sauces, and I usually eat 1,200 - 1,400 calories per day (and yes I know this is low but I have discussed it with my primary care doctor and I am medically supervised), and I try to eat 1g of protein for each pound of body weight but honestly I find this hard even with protein shakes and most days I'd say I eat closer to 80-90g of protein, and 1-2 days per week I eat around 150g of protein.

To start I'll say that I'm writing this post as a kind of personal catharsis, so apologies for excessive length or detail, but you have been warned it'll be long. If you just want to skip to the Dexa Scan story I've bolded that part below.

Like many folks in this community I have struggled with my weight since childhood. I never understood why until I was well into my 20's and I finally started therapy. While my weight was not what brought me to therapy, the process helped me immensely in understanding my relationship with food and how incredibly psychologically unhealthy it was, which in turn led to my poor eating habits and obesity. I never considered, for example, that my issues with secret eating began as not being secret at all: I'm an only child and my parents were both journalists that worked crazy nontraditional hours, which meant a ton of time spent alone and feeding myself when growing up. Not only did I unintentionally teach myself terrible eating habits but I also was using food as a way to comfort myself and fight the boredom of being home alone. When my parents had days off they would usually be too tired to cook and would want to spend as much time with me as possible doing fun things, so we'd inevitably go out. I loved it of course, but these patterns further tied food (and specifically eating out/eating unhealthy restaurant food) to comfort and goddamn is that a hard, hard thing to break after a lifetime of habit forming. Just as important as understanding the food issues my life circumstances had created was learning that I had ADD. 

This diagnosis literally changed my life and I am *still* having to fight my inner voice that tells me I'm lazy or labels me a procrastinator or tells me I'm inadequate, but gaining the understanding that my issues with overeating and boredom/comfort eating were tied to my mental illness was also immensely helpful. The stimulant medication also acts as an appetite suppressant and I was *pumped* to start the meds for that reason alone, but I quickly learned that my brain would override my body chemistry every time if I did not continue to address the psychological aspects of my relationship with eating, and the weight did not melt off and my appetite did not drop off very much either because of that. What the meds *did* do for me was help me to understand that my struggles in school were not a character flaw or ineptitude but symptoms of an untreated illness: after barely scraping through undergrad and failing out of my first attempt at grad school in my mid-20's, I was accepted into the Howard University School of Social Work and earned my fucking masters degree. I graduated suma cum laude and as a member of the academic honor society in 2021, all while working full-time for the county government. And honestly the hardest part of earning that degree was only having one parent there to see it.

Two years ago when lockdown started I decided that I would use the time to get healthy. I was 246 lbs at that point and I managed to get all the way down to the 207ish range in July through hard diet and exercise when my mom died. She had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in November of 2019 and she died in August of 2020. I sometimes feel pathetic at how much this fucked me up when I know that so many people lose parents at much younger ages, and that at 31 years old (and a social worker to boot) I am better equipped than most to handle the loss. But this sent me on a spiral, a spiral right back to the things that comforted me: food, beer, weed, and more food. I gained almost 13 pounds in a month. I knew it was coming. I knew that from the day we got the diagnosis. But I wanted so badly for her to live to see me graduate. For her to live through lockdown and get to go to the beach and to a baseball game with me one last time. I was just crushed under this immense weight of longing. Longing for all the things we should have been able to do, and longing most of all just to talk to her and hear her voice one more time.

I didn't even realize that I had missed registration for the fall semester I was so far gone. I couldn't concentrate at all at work and worried I would lose my job. Lucky for me social workers are a pretty understanding and empathetic lot (go figure?) and the school worked with me to get me back up to speed, and I'm proud to say that I was still able to do my work, and even took comfort in my classes. But it came at a cost (besides the usual student debt) and that cost was once again my health. After working hard to get down to 207 in July of 2020 I ballooned aaaallll the way back up to 243 in July of 2021. I had earned my masters degree, I had bought my first home with my wife, I had buried my mom: I was exhausted. I was fat. I was miserable.

For me the lightbulb came on that fall, somewhere around November 2021. I was unhappy with my weight but that was nothing new. I never even talked about it in therapy anymore because it was hardly high on my list of shit that was making me miserable. I was talking with my therapist about how much I was struggling with engaging with my friends and family: an unintended silver lining of losing my mom was that it brought many people closer together, and that intimacy and sense of purpose seemed to fade with every month that passed, and I was feeling guilty about that. These people had been so good to me and now all I cared about was numbing myself out with weed and alcohol after work every day, and I realized that I wasn't actually numbing myself out at all: I was still sad. I was still miserable. I was still grieving, and these things I was using to ""cope"" weren't even helping me fucking cope: they were just adding more problems on top of my existing ones while giving me a few fleeting hits of dopamine in return.

I got sober. I stopped smoking weed. I stopped drinking. This drastically reduced my mindless eating (to say nothing of all those calories from the beers I was guzzling) and it brought me back to one of my greatest passions: reading. Now that I wasn't going to bed high or drunk every night I could curl up with a book before bed. It cleared my head, it felt good, and it was fun. How could I have forgotten how much I loved to read? My earliest memories are of my parents reading me to sleep every night. Growing up, going to the bookstore was as good as Toys'R'Us. Reading slowed down my anxious, ADD brain, and I was able to use that focus and intentionality to see that I was not happy with the life I was living. It wasn't just reading I wanted to do more of: I wanted to travel with my wife, to go on dates (dates that went beyond just looking forward to the restaurant meal and the beer I'd drink with it), to live a life that nurtured my passions and not based around the dopamine I got from eating, drinking, and smoking. So finally, without ever even meaning to, I had affected a shift with my relationship with food as a result of taking a hard look at my relationship with substances and quick dopamine hits.

But I had been here before though. In college I had once reached my highest weight of 265 lbs before getting down to the 215-220 range. After college I had an extremely active job and took up running with a friend and got down to 200. From age 25 onwards I had yo-yoed, as I so often had throughout my life, between obese, overweight, and just fractionally overweight. I would go *hard* on restrictive eating, focusing only on calories rather than nutrition (ie, lots of lean cuisines and shitty microwave meals) while trying to run as much as I could until I got to a weight that I could ""relax"" at. Inevitably I always gained it back because these efforts were never sustainable, they were my own versions of crash diets through restrictive eating to desperately hit a comfortable weight as fast as I could and then go right back to my old lifestyle. This time I didn't want to do that. I wanted to actually feel good, not just thinner. 

**Start reading here to skip the personal history**

So in November 2021 I bought a food scale and started counting not just calories but macros. I read up on healthy living and weight loss in online communities like this one. I measured, I cooked, I made sure to engage my brain so I could actually stop and ask myself if I was hungry or bored, I focused on creating recipes that were filling, tasty, *and* low-calorie (aka volume eating) instead of shoving a lean cuisine in the microwave. I worked on moving more, but didn't make exercise (which I hate) the crux of my weight loss, and lo and behold this took the pressure off of working out and I started to even enjoy it a little, and do it a little more (I average 2-4 times per week of lifting and light cardio).

The weight melted off at rapid but steady clip. I weighed myself every day started on November 7, 2021 and that morning the scale read 231.2 lbs. Yesterday I stepped on that same scale and it read 190.8. I was proud of myself. I had hit 40 lbs lost and *this time it felt so sustainable.* I wasn't crash dieting. I wasn't restricting, miserably waiting to see the number I wanted so I could ""go back to normal."" I was enjoying the *process* instead of only looking forward to the results (something that is extra hard for us ADD folks!!). Now I was only 2-3 pounds from being at a normal BMI for the first time in probably 20+ years. I still feel like I'm carrying a bit of a fat tire around my stomach from all the years of beer, but my love handles were definitely less pronounced and my tummy is more of a pooch than a gut, so as I entered a phase of wanting to turn the fat into muscle I decided to ""treat"" myself to some real data: a Dexa scan and a metabolism test at a real doctors office.

I was able to schedule one that same day, and yesterday I went in, nervous but excited. I was worried that my metabolism testing would show me that I had a narrow margin to work with, but I was looking forward to seeing how low my body fat percentage was and then coming back this summer to compare the results when I did another Dexa scan. Unfortunately I got it *completely* backwards.

My metabolic testing showed that *at rest* my BMR is just over 2,500 calories per day. I was stunned. Instead of relief I felt like it must be wrong: that seems so high. How could I be in the top range of my expected BMR when I have been fat my whole life??

The Dexa scan results were even worse.

I was hoping for around (and hoping even more secretly for *under*) 20% body fat. I had worked so hard and even in my own eyes I could see the weight I had lost, which has always been hard for me to truly see.

The scan showed I had just over 27% body fat. I was (am) in the *bottom ten percent of body fat percentage for men at my height and weight.* Nine out of every ten men who are 6'1"" and 191 pounds will have less body fat than me.

I was stunned. I was crushed.

I sat in the car just staring at my phone. My excitement in waiting for the emailed results had turned to a churning anxiety in my stomach. All I could think was *what on earth do I do now?*

And that's what I'm hoping to hear from some of you today, I guess.

I *know* that I have come a long way from where I was in November. I mean my body fat must have been at least 40% back then, and 40 lbs is a huge accomplishment, but I can't help but feel so discouraged by what this means. I feel like I am at a point where I need to change something significant in my routine but I don't know where to begin. I am terrified of regaining weight. I don't want to lose muscle either, and I'd like to gain some more muscle, but really I just want to get rid of body fat. I'm definitely not giving up but I am worried that I will walk back  into that office in two months another 15 pounds down but still be flabby and with a high body fat percentage.

Any advice or encouragement would be welcome <3

Impulsive, eating for emotional regulation without end, overspending on take-out and junkfood",,14,1.0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6vu4v/guidance_needed_most_weight_ive_ever_been/,3,"Recently I've gained 10kg in the span of 3 months. I've had a bad time with my life, and in all honesty I have always used eating as something to regulate my mood. In example, I could have never gone to bed without feeling like there's something in my stomach, because I got bad memories in night time. 

I'm working on bringing these things up in therapy. However, I really need some ideas, thoughts or guidance about how to stop myself. Last year I introduced myself to the idea of doing things that feel good to me and now in a time of stress, binge eating feels great to me and I keep ordering food especially, plummeting my finances as well because I'm not sticking to my budget.

I tried tracking calories, it just made me feel guilt and worse which fed into the wanting to eat for comfort, chewing gum made me chew so much gum I felt sick, I even did keto once but I just get an intense urge and impulsive need to find some carb heavy food.

Surprisingly, what has helped me somewhat is intermittent fasting, eating a lot in one go or a short period of time can help me feel satiated for longer, but ironically I find it hard to eat a lot of food in one go that doesn't have the addictive junkfood qualities.

Yeah, I'm probably making excuses for myself, and I'm completely ready for someone to tell me I'm stupid, and I think that's really what I need to hear. I've worked so hard to get over my shame of how much I weight and I notice it creeping back, starting with not doing things because I gained weight or feeling insecure in front of others.

I wondered this after talking with a family member who has a close friend that is battling drug addiction. 

My family member is getting married next week and this friend was going. It‚Äôs a destination wedding. But a few weeks right before they‚Äôre set to all leave, the friend relapses. Winds up disappearing for days because they were using. They immediately went into rehab. This person seems to be good about getting themselves right into a rehab shortly after a relapse. But when I was talking to my family member about the friend and explaining some reasons I thought they‚Äôd relapsed, I found myself saying things that were true about me and what I do with food. 

I know I have addiction issues. I‚Äôve been overweight my whole life except for when I was anorexic and bulimic, which is extremely close to drug addiction. But I wonder what is the difference between how bad it is for someone to use drugs vs someone who‚Äôs morbidly obese like I am to be using food. 

I‚Äôve been struggling a lot. This time last year I‚Äôm pretty sure I promised myself I‚Äôd be down 100lbs. Then my birthday rolled around and I realized I‚Äôd wasted the time away. Again. I do this all the time. Every year. Every month. Week. Day. I‚Äôm going to do better *tomorrow* and then I binge. I just did for the past two days and I did the dumb last supper meal that we talk about in here sometimes. The dumb thing is that I don‚Äôt even have the capacity to eat all of the food I force myself to. I got Chinese food yesterday with a slice of cake. Only was able to eat one part of the food and the cake. So today I was going to get my binge perfect. I got Italian food and cupcakes. I could hardly eat most of the cupcakes. I tried to eat the Chinese food from yesterday after the other food. So I could finish the cupcakes. But I could really only eat the frosting and barely ate the remaining Chinese because I‚Äôm full from dinner still. 

I mean, this sounds completely insane to write out. It sounds sick. I just turned 33. My whole life I‚Äôve known I have an issue with food and weight. My family is to blame. They‚Äôre horrible. Super toxic diet culture. Zero boundaries. Etc. I even knew I had more issues because of the years of anorexia and bulimia. And then I became super morbidly obese after that (I‚Äôm now 311lbs at 5‚Äô4), so I know I have a problem. But I guess as I‚Äôm getting older and becoming more aware of watching myself fail that I‚Äôm beginning to understand that this issue is deep in a way that I do not fully understand. Maybe I think I know things and I do not. 

I‚Äôve had a rough few years. Chronic illness. Almost died from covid. I just got a job after seven years of not working. I‚Äôve become completely detached from my family, other than my parent, who I also think I see this pattern of wanting something but not actually implementing the tools to achieve the want. 

Thankfully I got this job because I 100% want to get myself into a therapist who is eating disorder or addiction specific. But maybe I need something even more. Should I join OA (Overeaters Anonymous) or something?? Has anyone here done that and it‚Äôs been helpful? 

I just, I cannot see what the difference between what I just did with food is to what my family member‚Äôs friend did. Maybe it‚Äôs just worse because it‚Äôs illegal to use drugs??? But it feels exactly like what I‚Äôve done. Extremely dangerous. Keeping myself in a dangerous position. Idk. 

I‚Äôm feeling low but also somewhat optimistic. Almost as if I‚Äôm actually able to see what I am doing, and not just be aware, but be aware and able to be like, ‚Äúthis is super fcked up and not normal.‚Äù

Edit: and this last supper crap. All I can remember when I was younger is that I was always told I couldn‚Äôt eat certain things, or couldn‚Äôt eat more than one of something: cookie, slice of pizza, slice of cake. Even before I thought about wanting another one. ‚ÄúThis is your last cookie so enjoy it!!‚Äù My mother would say that to me. I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd been thinking about eating another fcking cookie! But I bet it made me want another immediately because I couldn‚Äôt.

How likely is it that the 8lb is actually fat?",Question,10,0.82,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6vi4t/worried_about_gaining_8lb_in_one_month_making_me/,3,"I went to the doctor today for a follow up appointment for an unrelated issue and learned that I've allegedly gained 8lb in one month. Now I'm wondering to what extent that might be water weight and/or muscle mass.

I weighed 117 at the doctor last time I was there four weeks ago and now weigh 125. I've never weighed that much before in my life (5 feet tall). I've been holding my weight between 112 and 118 for the last two years and actually lost weight during COVID (despite drinking way too much and snacking more often). I'm usually able to carry my weight well and I wonder if I legit have big bones (e.g. was legitimately emaciated at 95lb, lost a lot of my hair and period).

I don't count calories (recovered from anorexia) but I don't think I eat very much, usually eating a small piece of baked oatmeal (made with just bananas, water, and oats) if I eat breakfast at all, eat a small homemade salad for lunch (e.g. a handful of chickpeas, 1/3 c cooked quinoa, a big dose of greens + vegetables, maybe a drizzle of tahini or olive oil, and I'll probably only eat half of that), and a home cooked meal of sorts (like 1/4 c rice, some broccoli, a chicken breast, maybe a sauce). Maybe I'll drink half of an oat milk latte (like 6 oz). I use oil sparingly. My husband and I go out to eat once a week and usually share a few plates of sushi. I'll have a single beer for fun once a week or so, too. I do eat a lot of salt though.

The only changes I've made since last month are doing *more* workouts (added pilates 4x a week; was previously using Peloton 2-3x a week), taking hikes on Saturdays, getting up early (waking at 6:30 now), and being a little bad about my water intake (drinking maybe 4c a day which needs to change). I also have been taking Miralax daily for some ongoing GI issues, which was prescribed to me. I was taking it prior to the last month, but every other day instead of the now daily routine.

My physique is shockingly more muscular now than it was last month (no weight training, just pilates) and I can see the midline of my abs/obliques starting to appear, alongside good definition in my shoulders, arms, calves, and quads. My clothes fit the same, which I wouldn't expect would be the case with 8lb of weight gain at my height (that's like 15lb on someone else). I still wear a size 2 or 4 and my measurements haven't changed (e.g. waist is still 25"").

Is it possible this is just water weight from me being bad about my water? Retention from the Miralax (TMI but it's osmotic and draws water into the colon)? Retention from weighing 15 min after I finished my morning pilates workout? New muscle? Margin of error from the digital scale? Being chronically constipated (lmao fml)? Maybe I'm just overweight and in denial (but how could I be overweight and a size 2? AHH). Can't weigh myself again in a few days because my partner and I both can get fixated on the scale (clearly) so we don't own one.

It just feels bad because I had so proudly held my weight down for a long time and had started to actually like how I looked recently after noticing major strength gains. When I stepped on the scale today I went from a healthy weight to being overweight overnight, and now I'm scared that eating small portions, whole foods, and moving my body in a way that is non-restrictive and makes me feel good is actually going to make me overweight.

ANYWAY!

Today is March 5. I did my second inbody scan. I am now at 270 lbs and while I lost fat, I lost 1.5 pounds of muscle mass. 

How did this happen? How do I gain more muscles without sacrificing fat loss? It was suggested that I eat more in general but I am worried that I will go back into the cycle of staying at the same weight without losing fat. Does this mean that I really do need to consume more protein? The protein farts and burps are real. üò© Is it really about eating more protein?

I've been calorie counting (using the ""Lose It!"" app), activity tracking with my Apple Watch, and weighing myself daily for a while.

I just exported my calorie data for the last \~5 weeks and was somewhat shocked to see that my predicated weight loss was 8.2 lbs and my actual weight loss was 8.3 lbs. That's an error of only 0.1 lbs (45 grams)! Average daily error was only about 9 calories. In other words, pretty much perfect.

This is great news for me personally for a couple reasons:

* I am analytically minded and I like being able to check my calorie counts throughout the day to decide what to eat, what kind of workout I should do, etc.
* I've found I do much better exercising more and then ""eating back"" those extra calories... I know that is contrary to the conventional wisdom but I have found I am much happier and less hungry that way rather getting my deficit by simply reducing calories consumed. The ""Lose It!"" app does a really nice job pulling in activity data and giving you credit for those extra calories in realtime.

Happy to answer any questions about my data or routine if anyone is interested.

EDIT: obviously YMMV with this. I highly recommend anyone counting calories to compare to an actual scale regularly and do the math.

I finally came across intermittent fasting and that‚Äôs exactly what I did, I forced my body to accept the amount of food I NEED over the amount of food I WANTED. It was huge, I never have eaten breakfast and would have big meals for lunch and dinner and usually late night snacks and when I started fasting, I cutout a full meal for lunch to just a few granola bars because in reality, that‚Äôs all my body needed to keep me full until dinner. For dinner, I literally just ate whatever my mom made that night. I drank lots of water and boom, 6-8 months later and I was down to 185 pounds. I rarely worked out during that time period until the end when I developed a liking for running. Ever since then I stayed at around 177-180 no matter what I never gained more than 5 pounds back.

Unpopular Opinion: I love only losing a pound a month

I was always skinny growing up. I stayed between 125-135 lbs throughout my adult life. But then I got pregnant. And then pregnant again. And then pregnant again. Pregnancy was the only thing that has ever caused me to gain weight. I have never kicked the weight off after any pregnancy either. I would sometimes try, but then get discouraged when things would go slowly. 

After my most recent baby was born, I had a lot of health concerns. Pulmonary embolism, blood thinner treatment, and worst of all, difficulty thinking and speaking which was made worse whenever I didn't eat enough. So losing weight was nearly impossible, especially because I couldn't excercise because of the pulmonary embolism. 

When I came to this sub after realizing I was at the precipice of obese a few months ago, I was in a panic. I read lots of stories of flip flopping weight. It felt like the opposite of the old adage what goes up must come down... only it was about weight! I wondered how I could prevent a flip flop if I finally did lose weight, because my body couldn't bear it when I ""tried hard"". Especially for a few days at a time. 

So then I decided that I'm in no hurry. I am not looking for a ""quick fix"". My one friend who lost a lot of weight did it so slowly and with lots of stability. It was such a smooth transition over the years and I want to do that too!

So with that in mind, I came up with a goal. A very happy goal. A very safe goal. My goal is to lose one pound a month. 

I didn't go crazy on the first day. I didn't take any drastic measures in my life. For example I eat a little less at breakfast... I don't have that second snack between lunch and dinner... Easy fixes!!! I still eat the foods that I like because it includes healthy foods. If I overindulge a day or two, I don't get discouraged because I know I have the rest of the month to get back on track.

This pound a month gives me a tangible goal. I am not doing anything unsustainable. I might need to be very strict eventually, but I'll have built to that place by following this one day at a time. I see my results and know that I'm headed in the right direction and I just smile. 

I really hope this helps someone. Just because you decide to lose weight doesn't mean you have to do it all at once. It could be one pound a month or one pound every 2-3 weeks, but having this goal is sustainable and peaceful. I have found a lot of self-love during this journey too!",1646374830.0

I've had some success, but it's ""scorched earth"" tactics.  I'd previously lost a lot of weight, but gained it all back. Been overweight my whole life; early 30s, got up to 280, dropped down to 180 in about a year which was by far the healthiest I'd ever been--was doing crossfit and everything--but injured my back in the gym in a way that continues to be quite limiting/somewhat painful, ended up back at 270, dropped back to 230, back up to 272 at 1/1/22.

I just have a lot of difficulty approaching this in a sustainable/healthy way.  Once I decide that I'm going to lose weight, I end up doing what I'm doing now, which is eating 1200-1500 calories (max) on most days, exercising as best as I can a few days a week (my prior injury is hugely limiting in what I can do).  I know that 1200-1500 calories isn't really workable and arguably I'm damaging my metabolism (again) by taking this approach, but if I try to go up to 1500-1800, it inevitably ends up at 2200+++.  For some reason I just can't hit that kind of middle ground--I think it's because at 1200-1500 I just see eating as a complete chore, everything I eat is bland or affirmatively stuff I do not particularly enjoy, and I have no room for stuff that I do enjoy, so it's an ""it is what it is"" kind of grind.  Obviously not sustainable long-term--the idea is always that I'll just suffer through it and then can loosen up when I'm at maintenance, but that's obviously not working.

Anyone had similar experiences/have any thoughts for how to grapple with it? I work an extremely sedentary, extremely long-hours job, so, unfortunately, significantly increasing activity level or doing fancy cooking are largely unworkable.",1646448098.0

Heyo,

So I was in the middle of losing a small amount of weight, for self confidence and health reasons. Over the past 6 months, I had comfortably dropped about 30 lbs through OMAD + decent full body exercise on the weekends. I was getting to a point where I was more toned than I had ever been my whole life and was starting to look up a bit in general.

While doing a routine, I believe I had torn my ACL and it's honestly just been a sudden shock these past few days with dealing with insurance + the ER visits + the inability to really walk on the leg itself. I'm upset for a multitude of reasons, including the general difficulty day-to-day moving around, but I genuinely fear that I'm gonna undo a majority of the progress that I had maintained. It's been a week so far, and I've delved back into cooking as a partial comfort and I've gained like 3 or so pounds since maintaining the injury.

Do y'all have advice for working through this or is it above reddit's pay grade/is therapy needed? Lmk",1646442287.0

First of all I typically don‚Äôt eat vegetables as I‚Äôm repulsed by the taste of around 90% of them, this isn‚Äôt an over exaggeration, typically it makes me physically sick to taste them or try to swallow them, a lot of it is also to do with texture. The exception here is either blended vegetables in the form of sauces, stocks or soups. I typically don‚Äôt mind if some veggies are in foods such as in bolognese/pies for example when they have things like small pieces of onions/carrot/celery. Onions are about the only vegetables I can eat happily as I like onions in a variety of ways. 

I can‚Äôt quite explain my diet in a short sense as other than not eating veggies I have quite a healthy diet as i eat a variety of things. most of which are home cooked meals that I make myself from scratch as I love cooking. I‚Äôd say if anything, it‚Äôs quite carb/meat heavy but that would be the only stand out part. I do like a lot of fruit but I tend not to eat it as I just forget to buy it most of the time, that‚Äôs just a fault of my own and I will attempt to improve that. Typically in a day I will get up and have breakfast which for a long while was 2 chocolate weetabix with a drizzle of honey on top, however I‚Äôve fallen out of routine with that and gone back to some kind of sugary cereal. After this I will tend to have 1 or two snacks usually chocolate biscuits or some kind of dessert from the fridge before I eat dinner at around 6pm and then again after this I will snack on typically sweet things before bed. I will preface and say I do not over eat, I try to limit how many snacks/sweet things I do have in a day and my portions at dinner are never large, just enough to make me full. 

Other than this I do not smoke, consume alcohol, I do not drink coffee or tea and 90% of what I drink is water. I also go to the gym typically 3 times a week, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 and i‚Äôm about an average weight for my height.

t6ht0b,The four-year maintainance break,,16,0.82,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6ht0b/the_fouryear_maintainance_break/,3,"The goal of this post is to show one aspect of trying to get from obese to normal weight. For some people it's not linear, or easy.

In my case, it is complicated by age (premenopausal), chronic health issues and a steroid course that derailed my apetite at age 34, people don't reach 34 being normal weight by chance, they know how to stay at that weight. I almost never got back to normal apetite and have to fight my body.

So it was intuitive eating all along that got me to 75kg from about 104kg. I had read about what are filling foods that are not heavy on calories and avoided fat, mostly. Stuck to filling foods, vegetables and some fruit, some aminal protein, very few non-healthy snacks here and there. I had to look intensely for the only grocery store in my area that had tasty fruits and vegetables, not the standard, bland kind. This loss happened over the course of a few months, back in 2018. This sub helped me immensely to figure out that everything is CICO. What worked in terms of new habits was intermittent fasting plus walking for about 2 hours each day, before eating. I seem to lose more easily and have less cravings when I avoid sugar. Spring is always better as there are not many events and I enjoy seasonal fruit and strawberries in particular.

At some point, after I got to 75kg, people started showering me with compliments and I would get male attention.

But it was back in November 2018 when I started feeling lethargic, my hair started to fall and decided it was time for a maintainance break. I thought no big deal, I knew how to lose. It was a mix of going back not quite to my former eating and some cravings. The classic mistake of not weighing myself very often. But coupled with age, hormones and the general signs my body was giving me, getting into restriction again was not tolerated by my body. In March 2019 I weighed myself and it was 84,5 kilos.

I had thought, why not enjoy the festive season, I know how to lose now. How wrong that was.

I have hovered between 80 and 87 since, staying around 84,5 for most of that time, taking care not to gain weight and trying many times to start again losing consistently. Today I weigh 83,1 kilos from 87 a couple of moths ago. My husband also is a food addict and I learned to do my own thing and resist temptations, having healthy snacks available at all times.

So now I am back to losing reliably. It is obvious by now that it is a mix of season, IF and having some kind of reserves, to be able to stick with a deficit. I am feeling now a wave of reserves that allowed me to lose back in 2018. It's a big win, of course, that I never got back to my highest weight, that I celebrate in a way every waking moment. Not much loose skin, but the clock is ticking, as I will get into menopause. The reasonable goal now will be to get to 75kg.

I never changed my flair, because it gives me the satisfaction of that first win. I will change it again when it will get lower than 75. Ultimate goal weight. My original one, between 60-65 kilos.

Many congrats on you younger people that got control of your habits earlier.

Wish me luck!",1646396571.0

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

I've noticed some improvements the past few months in that area but it almost seems like the muscle is just coming in ""under the fat"" in my chest and stomach if that makes sense. I'm definitely slimming down but it's almost like my skin is baggier or flabbier where the fat used to be. Will this disappear and the skin tighten more over time if I stay the course or does anyone have experience toning up after significant weight loss?",1646419589.0

Hello r/loseit! I have been following you for a long time and I got the motivation that I lacked to finally get down to my goal weight.

Some background information is that I was never overweight, my weight always oscillated between 59kg and 63kg being mostly at 61kg. This last lockdown I gained 5kg and went up to almost 66kg, but I decided that in stead of just losing what I had gained, I wanted to actually reach a healthier weight for me, which would be around 56-58kg (closer to the middle range of my BMI).

I am eating between 1400 and 1600kcal a day, weighting and logging everything to the gramm, getting enough protein, hitting 10k steps everyday and working out 4-6 times a week, so losing the first 5kg was easy. However, I feel like no matter how much I control CICO I am stuck in my previous weight. Is this an usual thing to happen? Do I have to change anything once I have reached this point to keep losing weight?",1646403620.0

What I do: 
5 days week at 1300 calories, trying to get to 100 grams of protein per day. Most days land around 80-90g. 

2 days a week have been my ‚Äúcheats.‚Äù That includes no counting (but mindful, no binges or whole pan of brownies) and drinking a few cocktails or glasses of wine. 

Working out 3x a week, one day of heavy lifting and 2 days of light lifting or HIIT. My workouts usually 45 minutes-1 hour, and rest days in between. 
I also take my dog on walks daily, could be anything from 15 minutes to 1 hour of walking depending on weather.

Need some perspective and advice on dealing with it. 

I (24F, 5ft5, SW208 CW195 GW healthy ~ 153lbs) had a contraceptive implant taken out and coil put in yesterday. I was anticipating some pain after but holy moly, I thought something was trying to burrow its way out of my abdomen alien-style. Following this I went to the shop and got myself a bottle of wine, a large bar of chocolate and a family bag of crisps because I wanted it after a crap morning. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, I didn‚Äôt justify it saying to myself ‚ÄòI deserve it‚Äô or ‚ÄòI‚Äôll only eat half‚Äô. I actively thought about buying something healthy and acknowledged that it was a bad idea and off track but decided it was worth it because I felt so terrible and that I would deal with the consequences tomorrow. I went home, ate some chocolate, 2/3 the bag of crisps and 2 glasses of wine plus my regular evening meal. I made sure to track it all just to see how much damage I was doing and at the end of the day came to ~2500 cals but feeling pretty grotty from the junk food. I also felt in control of my eating and stopped when I was full. 

Today I woke up and immediately felt guilty. ‚ÄòBinge eating‚Äô seems like the new internet buzz word for if you eat a bit of junk. This seems horrifically unfair to the people who suffer from BED which from what I understand is a horrendous condition to go through characterised by inability to control food consumption during a binge and in some cases purging. Please educate me if I am wrong. 

Despite knowing this I‚Äôve spent all morning googling and feeling guilty. I started today back on track but am struggling with feeling sad that I made an active decision to move away from my recent healthy but sustainable lifestyle. I typically eat 1500-1600 calories without depriving myself of cravings and have been losing at a slow but consistent rate.

Hello all!

Thanks for reading my first post, I just started my weight loss journey and am determined not to give up! Having lost 5 pounds now makes me feel amazing because it shows what I‚Äôm doing is actually working and motivates me to keep going. 

So, I have always been overweight my whole life. I have memories from preschool of being made fun of for my belly. I never though actually tried to lose weight before now. For all of highschool and most of college I was between 160-170 lbs. I didn‚Äôt really watch what I ate, but I was much more active. I graduated from college in May and honestly at the end I was really struggling. I started rewarding myself at the end of the day for doing so much schoolwork I didn‚Äôt want to do with foods I knew were unhealthy like pizza and french fries. I also lived that year for the first time alone, so I didn‚Äôt have anyone to judge what I ate. It was also a block away from a convenience store so almost daily I would walk there and just get snacks.

When it started to get cold in the fall, I would come to realized all of my jeans are too tight now which was the motivating factor for starting this journey. I was a size 12/30in waist, so the idea that I would soon not be able to find my size in regular stores worried me. I always said how even though I am treated differently because of my weight socially, I can‚Äôt compare to the societal factors that affect someone much larger who can‚Äôt walk into any store and find something that fits, among other things. So I bought one new pair that fits (my leggings still fit) and decided I would lose more than just this recent gain and just buy new clothes then. I have always held myself back from wearing clothes i want to because of my body so the idea of buying all new clothes is so exciting to me. 

I weighted in the for first time on Dec 30th at 185lbs, by Feb 1st I was 182.2, but wouldn‚Äôt lose the remaining 2.2lbs until this week. I started with counting calories, MFP said 1460 cals was my goal and i logged and tracked for a little but it really doesn‚Äôt work with my lifestyle. I got a good understanding though of how many calories I was eating before (way too many) and what 1500 cals looks like in the foods I regularly eat. I have been vegetarian for a few years now so I think at the beginning I was struggling with meals because I couldn‚Äôt just eat grilled chicken and broccoli for every meal. I also think not exercising consistently is why I didn‚Äôt lose more in Jan. Now, in Feb I haven‚Äôt been snacking nearly as much, haven‚Äôt had any high calorie day slip ups, getting my protein in, cut down sugar and bread, and am going to the gym about 4 days a week. (expect week of my period only went twice, i maintained 182 during that week.) I am only at the gym for a half hour, i do 2 miles on the treadmill of mixed running and walking. i‚Äôm trying to run more but I really don‚Äôt have good endurance. I make sure though when I‚Äôm walking it‚Äôs still fast breaking a sweat.

I didn‚Äôt put a goal weight because I really don‚Äôt know, I am going to look into it more when I lose more. I‚Äôm focused now on getting below 160 with no timeframe in mind because I want to do this weight loss healthy and sustainably. Reading about other people‚Äôs journeys has really been inspiring for me so I figured I‚Äôd contribute since I don‚Äôt see many women with my starting weight and height. Hopefully will contribute before and after pictures one day!",1646358800.0

t6aghp,An unexpected consequence of my weight loss.,Discussion,18,0.81,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6aghp/an_unexpected_consequence_of_my_weight_loss/,7,"I‚Äôve lost nearly 90 lbs and am maintaining my weight, which is good. Some things happened along the way which I expected; better sleep, improved flexibility, buying new clothes, etc. But a few things happened that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.

One thing, which I‚Äôm still coming to terms with, is that I‚Äôm now seemingly incapable of eating ‚Äúlarge‚Äù amounts of refined carbs without feeling like I swallowed a stone. A year ago I could eat four slices of pizza and think nothing of it. Today if I eat more than one it literally feels like a stone in my stomach. Same thing with pasta and bread. I can‚Äôt even eat a whole bagel without that stone feeling.

I know that from some perspective this is ‚Äúgood‚Äù because I‚Äôm substantially less likely to binge on those things, but it makes me wonder. After seven months of strict dieting, did I actually change my physiology? Or is this a mental thing that I accidentally inflicted upon myself?",1646367782.0

t6pkqh,I had been consistently losing weight for a year. Why am I suddenly gaining weight again?,Question,0,0.5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t6pkqh/i_had_been_consistently_losing_weight_for_a_year/,5,"A year ago, I weighed 203 pounds. A month ago, I weighed 166 pounds. I‚Äôve been 174 for the past week. Luckily, it seems fairly stable, but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what could‚Äôve caused it.

I think most of the weight loss can be attributed to diet. My diet a year ago was pretty awful. I probably had pizza four days a week and had desserts nearly as often. The diet I‚Äôve tried to stick to since then is that I only eat for protein or veggies, not carbs or sugar. Bread on my sandwich or whatever is fine, but I don‚Äôt just snack on carbs or really ever eat sweets. I‚Äôm also vegetarian. The rationale is that it‚Äôs usually a lack of protein that‚Äôs making me hungry, so by eating carb-heavy food, I‚Äôm stocking up on calories without getting fuller.

I think over time I‚Äôve only gotten better at sticking to that diet and I‚Äôve found healthier meals within it. I can‚Äôt think of any major changes this month that would cause weight gain. I guess I might be eating more sodium (soy sauce)? 

Exercise could also be a factor. I usually go running every other week. The inly change there is that I‚Äôm able to run faster and further now. I also recently started a little strength training. Just like daily pushups/squats/etc for no more than 10 mins. I suppose I could have gained muscle weight, but I doubt it accounts for eight pounds.

Any ideas?",1646418717.0

Hello everyone !

Today I just wanted to share a SV that means a lot to me. I finally got under 100kg again! I know this might not mean much for a lot of people but after months and months of not losing any weight this is pretty big to me.

I think I‚Äôve only binged once during the week and I was able to deal with it pretty well. In addition to that I‚Äôve been starting to track my calorie intake. So far I‚Äôm only tracking calories for one meal a day just so that I can get used to it.

One thing that also really helped, not only for weight loss but most importantly for my mental health, was to exercise regularly. I went to the gym four times this week and just went for a light walk on rest days.
I feel stronger, energised and my stress and anxiety levels have substantially decreased.

I‚Äôm still very much struggling with the nutrition part, and would gladly appreciate some advice.

Thank you for reading this and whoever  you are I hope you have a great day !",1646390151.0

So far I have protein powder (whey), protein bars, CLA supplements and inositol. I know the latter two you take with every meal - but can I take them together? Should I be taking them together?

t68c7k,NSV and body recomp update at 5 months.,-,15,0.88,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t68c7k/nsv_and_body_recomp_update_at_5_months/,1,"42(F), 5‚Äô7‚Äù, SW:169, CW:164, GW:?

I‚Äôm going to start off mentioning that weight is irrelevant, as I have discovered this week. Doing a recomp, I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt see the scale change much, but it was still hard to deal with that lack of positive feedback. 

I started my recent journey 10/4/21. I had to plan to get strong, get lean, and feel proud of myself. I knew from previous fitness journeys that I wanted to take the long term approach and build muscle instead of just CICO. I bought a home gym so that I can hopefully never have a reason to skip working out again. In the past lack of childcare, husband traveling, time constraints, etc. had derailed a previously entrenched habit. 

Over the last two weeks I‚Äôve finally been able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a difference in my body. Before that other people commented positively, but I couldn‚Äôt see it. I knew from measurements I had lost over 11‚Äù, and could see a difference in how some (not all) clothes fit. 

Well, yesterday was the first time I‚Äôd set foot in a store in two years, so also the first time I‚Äôd shopped since I started working in getting fit. It was also the first time I‚Äôd seen myself in a full length mirror (and the backside mirror) in two years, and damn was I amazed! My legs and butt are damn near perfection right now. This was completely obscured to me by not having full length mirrors, and also having a good amount of belly weight that is trimming down, but still very much there. Seeing myself was revelatory‚Äîthe recomp is successful. It‚Äôs working marvelously. 

Aside from that, all of the clothes I bought were mediums. I had also gone from a 36DD bra to a 34B and there was no backfat visible with the smaller size. My legs and butt have gone from a 12 to size 6 size, but I‚Äôm still a size 8 until I can loose a bit more belly. Still, I‚Äôm almost there. 

As far as my process: I eat a minimum of 1590 calories a day right now, but started with a lower deficit to ease into it and build muscle easier. I go over this slightly a couple days a week, if needed due to my workouts. At least once a month I try to have a day where I eat closer to 2000 calories to prevent my body from getting to accustomed to a deficit. Sometimes I‚Äôll do a whole week at your bear later maintenance as a reset and rest for my body.  

I lift weights for 36-46 minutes 3-5 times a week. I do heavy weights (aim for close to failure or complete failure in 8-12 reps in 3-4 sets). I do light treadmill one day a week typically for 30-48 minutes, and one day of more intense cardio for 25-45 minutes). In the beginning I was so sore that I could only lift 2-maybe 3 days a week. It was not uncommon to need a 5 day break until I started doing upper/lower splits. I also did the cardio very sporadically at first. The stronger I get, the harder it is to not do something fitness-oriented each day. 

It took me 4.5 months to lift my first 100k lbs, but it only took two weeks to lift my next 56k lbs. it‚Äôs a snowball effect, and that was also when I noticed the biggest changes physically. Once you reach a certain point, things just start changing. Keep at it. Maybe ignore your scale completely.

I know I could have had more dramatic weight loss effects by just doing CICO, but I wanted to build my metabolism and build muscle. I‚Äôm also breastfeeding, so wanted to make sure I was eating adequately to maintain high milk quality/quantity.

The other thing I will say is that contrary to every post I see, when I got my food scale, it turned out I‚Äôd been eating less calories than I thought. It happens. I bumped my calories up, and viola started losing more and seeing more results.",1646360989.0

I made a post here earlier this week about how I started going to the gym + 4 mile walk every morning, and I only eat 2 times a day (breakfast + dinner) - I've also started drinking more water now. I weighed myself last weekend and I was 334.4 lb. I weighed myself this morning and I'm 344 lb?? Is my weight scale really telling me that after all that effort, I lost a measly 0.5 lb??

For context, I'm a 6'4 man weighing apparently 334 lb now, and weight loss is usually much faster for me. Last year i hardly did any exercise at all and I was losing weight at a rate of approx. 0.5 \*per day\*, not \*week\*. What's changed now is that I started going to the gym, most of the time there is spent doing muscle training (3 sets, 15 reps on every upper body machine) and I'm now walking every day instead of once per week.

Why am I not losing any weight?? That's actually quite upsetting and I'm tempted to just ditch the scale because it's really demotivating.

Only thing I could possibly think of is that the last time I weighed myself it was later in the morning, and also I drank 1L of water at the gym last night, but that was around 8pm  - honestly I was expecting I'd be 329 lb by today.

Edit: I started at 344.5 lb on 18th Feb. In the first 9 days I lost 10 lb but since then I re weighed myself and I lost 0.5 lb

I've been eating 1200 calories of real food, mainly proteins for a week but my weight keeps going up. I went from having skinny tooth pick legs (before Xmas) to big fat thighs again. It's frustrating because I'm afraid I've damaged my body so much and basically all the weight I lost was never real, it was just the result of starving. Right now I'm gaining on 1200 calories and the urge to restrict is always there because I'm scared I'll go back to my previous weight even by eating so little. I'm bloated and constipated ever since I started to eat healthily, I'm visibly bigger (people can confirm, it's not body dismorphia) and I don't understand what's going on. I hope someone can write some comforting words or maybe tell me what's going on. I can't look at myself in the mirror without crying.",1646316780.0

a couple of weeks later, making sure i was in a deficit (according to myfitnesspal), i did the same thing & it said i would‚Äôve been 78kg. 

i then went to measure myself a few weeks after that and my first measurement was the exact same as last time, so i got anxious and stopped measuring altogether. i‚Äôm really anxious that i‚Äôve stopped making progress, and i don‚Äôt know what to do.

myfitnesspal says to lose a pound a week i need to eat ~1300 calories per day. i stay around that amount most days, but if i‚Äôm really hungry one day or need to go out/eat more etc i go above it. i never go above 200-450 calories over my limit so i always stay either at maintenance or a deficit. 

i only took my first measurements in early february, but i‚Äôm really anxious that i‚Äôm not making progress anymore. i don‚Äôt exercise a whole lot because it stresses me out, but i do try a short (15-30 minute) cardio workout from youtube every few days along with my deficit. i don‚Äôt eat back those calories.

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm feeling right now. Betrayal from my own body possibly? 

I decided that January 1st, 2022 I was going to change my life for the better. 

I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, female and 216-220 pounds (I fluctuate around this area). 

I have been working out *every single day* since January 3rd, except for Saturdays and Sundays which are my rest days. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I go for a three mile walk with my dogs, then when I get back home I lift weights targeting different areas of my body. So Monday‚Äôs are for arms/chest/back, Wednesday‚Äôs are for my core, lastly, Friday‚Äôs are for my legs/booty. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I do full body HIIT workouts. I work out hard and push myself harder every time. I workout until you can see sweat stains on my clothes and until my body feels like jelly. 

As for eating I have been doing so good and I‚Äôve actually been enjoying the food I‚Äôve been eating. I have PCOS and metabolic syndrome so my doctor said I should do fasting with these conditions. I fast for 16 hours and I have an 8 hour window to eat. In that 8 hour window when I do eat, I eat lots of protein. I start eating at noon so at that time I will have two hard boiled eggs, or oatmeal with fruit or a protein shake. This keeps me full until dinner time and I make chicken, or I have roasted vegetables and lately I‚Äôve really been into salads or a homemade chipotle bowl with whole grain rice. If I feel like snacking I have nuts, beef jerky, skinny popcorn, yogurt, or I have chopped raw vegetables in my fridge ready to go. I eat pretty well. 

HOWEVER, here‚Äôs my problem: *I‚Äôm losing zero weight and zero inches.*

Yes, that‚Äôs right. I‚Äôve been pushing myself since January 3rd, changed my eating habits, went from a sedentary lifestyle to active and I‚Äôve lost *NOTHING*. The *only* thing I‚Äôve lost has been 1/2 an inch around my waist. That is all I have to show after my hard work. 

Just a few years ago I weighed 140 pounds. My best friend passed away, I became depressed and I guess I turned to food to comfort me. I don‚Äôt even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I miss the girl I used to look like. 

Now, I could understand if I wasn‚Äôt losing the weight because ‚Äúthat is just what my body is supposed to be at‚Äù, but I know that‚Äôs not true. I used to be 140 pounds. This is not my normal. It is not normal to put on 90 pounds in three years. 

So, why am I not losing any weight?! I haven‚Äôt even lost any water weight! I‚Äôve lost nothing but that half inch around my waist. But I am still fluctuating from 216-220 just like I was January 1st. 

What am I doing wrong?! I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do. I brought all of this up with my doctor yesterday and she just said that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing everything right and to keep going‚Äù, but if I was doing everything right don‚Äôt you think I would‚Äôve lost some inches? Or lost at least 1-2 pounds? 

Please help me. I am about to completely give up. I just want to feel like me again. The girl who used to be happy, who felt good in the clothes she wore instead of hiding in sweatshirts and loose fitting clothing. I am feeling beyond defeated right now.",1646359378.0

My partner is now also interested in how I did it, but the thing is, I'm still not confident enough to be giving solid advice to other people, you know? So here are my partner's stats, he is a little older than me so maybe it will be better if he loses weight slowly, so that he doesn't end up with loose skin. 

Today he has formally asked me about how many calories he should be taking, so I guess this is his ""day 1"" :) 

*Age: 29*

*Height: 5'6""/173cm*

*Weight: 207lb/94kg*

*RMR: 1849kcal, TDEE: 3328kcal (he does a lot of physical work)*

I think a realistic goal weight for him at this stage would be about 175lbs/80kgs, right?

How many calories should he be eating? I'm also willing to generally count his macros (I do the cooking anyway) - how much protein should he be getting, etc? I don't want him to go on keto or anything, as I didn't need to and have been doing fine losing weight. 

Side note - if I do (on his request/complaint) reduce his portions, he does end up snacking at the end of the day to fill in those calories. Does anyone have any additional advice for him? I have also told him that if he starts going back to the gym his TDEE/calorie calculation will change.

A little over 6 months. In that time, I have been eating fast food and other store bought junk almost, if not everyday. To begin the year, I was good, keeping myself in check, watching what I ate and home making food, and still weighing 200-205 pounds. After about a month and a half, it all began to change. Each night, I began to eat McDonald‚Äôs, Taco Bell, Wendy‚Äôs, Culver‚Äôs, Chick fil A and more. As the next 2.5 months passed and we coasted into holiday break, I was hovering around 225 pounds or so. Over the break, I steadied around the same weight, and on the back end when it was time to leave home and go back to school, I was hanging just below 225. Now, I have been back at school for a month and a half, and I have once again gained weight, as now I‚Äôm up to 235 pounds. I‚Äôm now up 30-35 pounds in just over 6 months. I have changed so much in that time. I was in the best shape of my life coming into college, I was lifting, eating better, and actually dropping weight. Since I‚Äôve been away at school, lifting has become sparse. I still go and lift but it‚Äôs not the same as it was before. I eat fast food almost everyday if not everyday, and my shopping cart is full of fattening sweets. I always have Oreos, chips ahoy, pop tarts, ice cream, chocolate candies and so much more. I need to get back on track because my body has just changed so much. I‚Äôve had to get new jeans in the time I‚Äôve been here and already those are getting tighter. Most of my shirts are tight on my belly, as I am beginning to get a bit of a bigger belly now.

Also play Soccer during lunch every day. I also climb \~ 16 floors. So I get some cardio in, although my knees hurt at the end of the day.

Current Diet:

* Not great to be honest. Usually between 1800-2000 calories a day. High carb, fat and sugar, with a lack of protein (I am non-vegetarian). Usually eat Lentils, Rice, and some Veggies for lunch and dinner. I know I have to cut down on the sweets but I have pretty terrible self control. Will work over the next few weeks using Calorie tracking apps like HealthifyMe (which has options for my Indian food).  Friday's I have a cheat meal.

**Self-image and identity**

A recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t30atr/struggling_with_selfimage/) by u/pecan-pie-eater/ about this and several interactions I had this week brought to mind this weeks' topic.  

I still think of myself as a ""big guy"". I spent 30+ years in that mode. Several of my nicknames are weight/size related and yet, objectively, I'm smaller than average for my age and height. 

I was having a dinner with new work colleagues. During the meal one of my colleagues commented that there were only two people in the company who could drink him under the table and both of those are rail thin. 

I am said thin colleague's manager. When we happen to be in the same city, we tend to eat together a fair amount. The previous day we bought sandwiches for lunch together. He ate half of his sandwich and put the rest away in the company fridge. I never see him ""snack"", he mostly drinks water or coffee without milk sugar or flavorings. If I do catch him having breakfast it's just a 100-150 kcal yogurt where as I will generally have a couple of eggs too. Dinner he partakes ""normally"", but will often leave some food uneaten.

Yet, when asked later by one of the new colleagues how he stays so thin ... ""I play soccer but was blessed with a good metabolism."" 

It was around then, that I mentioned to the new colleague that 4 years ago I weighed over 100 lbs/50kg more than I do today and yes I do run and stay active, but the key thing has really been just regularly eating a little bit less.

Since I knew we were having that dinner later, my breakfast was two eggs and half an almond croissant (~350 kcal) lunch that day consisted in one small pack of pre-grilled chicken 130 kcal, one Greek yogurt, 120 kcal and a fun size Kit Kat for ~320 kcal. I had a banana mid-afternoon.

So I just enjoyed my evening meal.

So what does this have to do with self-image?

My thin colleague labels himself as blessed with a decent metabolism, but I see his eating habits are actually more like mine are now. He picks where he puts his calories. 

Yes, he can still definitely drink me under the table. But he also paces himself  more than I do. I saw that first hand yesterday evening when we were enjoying cocktails at a bar after work.  I was 75% done with my second round when he was only 25% in. 

I still think of myself as a ""bug guy"". I still don't always recognize myself when I look for the big guy in a picture or at my body in a reflection. And yet, the irony  is that at 167 I also feel rather ""fat""

These days it only takes me less than a minute to adjust to my reflection, or to catch myself when I am about to ask someone to pull in their char so I can go behind them. I'll usually fit, but my eyes see the space as impossibly small.

So what about you Centurion? How do you synthesize all of those different aspects of your self-image and self-identity when you're going through such **radical** changes to the way you look, feel and act?",1646329999.0

I've been strength training for around 5weeks now, 3-4times a week and here are my thoughts..I'm loving it!!

All I do really is follow these dumbbells workout videos by Growwithjo with 3lbs weights and the ones by Mrandmrsmucle with 5lbs weights and I'm seeing a good difference in my arms and my legs. 

My weightloss journey was also an interesting workout journey, I'll list what I did as I didn't just went from no activity at all to strength training. 

Started back in March 2021, all I did was follow these dance workout videos by Madfit and did a few low impact Chloe Tang videos 4-5times a week. Was really just trying to get 30mins-45mins of activity. 

Then I switched to walking indoors and workout videos by Growwithjo. 

I spent the Summer walking 5-7km, sometimes 2times a day, 4-5days a week.

Then when Winter hit I went back to my usual at home workout but the issue is I had lost a lot of weight, was way more active and needed a change as my usual workout wasn't it anymore after months of walking and being way more active, did kickboxing and walking videos for a bit then went into strength training.


**Strength training.**

After 5weeks of strength training, I'm loving it! I spent the month yoyoing to finally hit 245. I lost 5 pounds in a month, I usually lose around 8 a month. My body is changing, looking better, more toned, people act like my weightloss is recent and keep saying I look way smaller which is wild as I really only lost 22pounds in the pass 3months and only started strength training 5weeks ago but apparently it shows more now. 

I definitely have some small gains, my arms are more defined and more muscular when I flex. My legs are leaner and my thighs hard as rock. Definitely noticing my pants being a bit more loose at the waist and clothes fit better. 

That's 5weeks and 5pounds which I'm super happy about!!


**Random observations.** 

‚Ä¢ I lost a lot of weight and don't think I'd have had the same experience if I had started strength training starting my weightloss journey and I think that after losing 100lbs+ and being almost 1year into my journey, it was the perfect timing for me to start strength training and find it actually motivating as I can see the results. 

‚Ä¢ I feel more balanced and grounded on my feet, idk how to describe it but yeah..more stability. 

‚Ä¢ I'm more aware of my loose skin, not in a negative way, my loose skin is more visible as everything under is getting more toned and I'm loving it. I'm slowly seeing what my body looks like under it all. It feels like my loose skin is really just this random layer of skin around my body which I'm fine with. 

*It might be because my loose skin is more visible if for example I lift my arms but when I don't, my arms look way skinnier than they used to now that my shoulders and upper arms are more defined.*

‚Ä¢ I always had a flat ass and stubborn lower back fat that wouldn't go away. My ass is a bit less square shape(square booty gang) and the lower back fat is slowly starting to go away. 


**My current workout routine.**

*Not in any order or anything as I switch things up here and there.*

My whole life I've been overweight. from when I was born to age 19 I was always overweight and extremely insecure about my body. When I went to college, I was broke so never ate and went to the gym a lot so I got down to like 180. then somehow I gained a lot of weight. and I'm back to 230. 

**here are the things I'm doing to try and lose weight.**

Creatine every day, a gallon of water every day, apple cider vinegar every day, eat only meat and veggies,  limited carbs, and almost no sugar, protein after every workout, 1600-1800 calories a day, gym 4-5 days a week, active job, multivitamin every day, plenty of fiber, good sleep, cardio,  I've even gone as far as not having sex to try and boost my testosterone levels. 

I'm 2 months into the gym almost every day

**and here are my stats.**

Weight:230

Age: 25

Height: 5'11

Gender: male

**Things I struggle with.**

Nicotine, skipping meals, 0 sex drive, I have a lot going on in my life so high daily stress 

**Goal.**

weight 180-190

look more skinny instead of a fat/bloated frumpy mess 

I'm just tryna go to the beach without feeling insecure

  
I wonder if I have low test levels or just a broken metabolism. in my mind, I'm doing everything right. but the weight just won't come off. I'm so desperate at this point that I'm about to just starve myself again like I did when I went to college because that's the only thing that worked.

t67rbd,"I'm extremely skeptical of meal plans or routines that have a ""detox"" element, am I wrong to be so?",Question,3,0.67,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t67rbd/im_extremely_skeptical_of_meal_plans_or_routines/,8,"I recently checked out a book from the library called ""Women, Hormones and Food"" and for the first part of the book, it seemed credible and on point. Then it gets to the plan and the first 4 weeks are this elaborate modified keto (sigh) billed as a ""detox"" (partly from carbs and sugar, which isn't terrible, but also from things like BPA and heavy metals--how much of a thing is this?). I don't drink alcohol but leaving that aside, I'm pretty sure my liver and gall bladder and associated organs ""detox"" my body pretty well without me going on some elaborate protocol that involves doing **formulas** to figure out a ketogenic ratio for all foods and testing my ketones every day and blah blah blah. 

It sounds to me like the women in the book that lost weight did it because they ate **literally** almost no carbs for 4 weeks including starchy veg and fruits (!!) and due to the restrictions on their typical diets, their calories dramatically plunged since they weren't eating bread, rice, sweets, hardly any sugars of any kind, etc. 

Am I off base here? I reluctantly agree that a low carb diet is for sure going to strip the pounds of practically everyone, but is ""detox"" really a thing?",1646359179.0
t5eshi,A few things I realized after losing the weight,Discussion,308,0.97,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t5eshi/a_few_things_i_realized_after_losing_the_weight/,62,"Well, not ALL of it, but I am roughly 80% of the way there, with a loss of 52lbs currently. I wanted to share some of the changes that happened in my life that some people might not think about or expect, or for people who have lost a major amount of weight already, maybe they could relate to me. 

1. The amount of energy difference is more than you can imagine. This one seems obvious, but from my perspective of being almost or above the obese line all my life, and now I am not, I did not realize the sheer difference of cardiovascular health and endurance. What I thought was normal was not normal, it was just all I knew. The amount I can do without getting winded is not even comparable. My resting heart rate went from 92 to 64.

2. Getting new clothes is expensive, but you'll 100% want to do it. I suggest everyone put money aside for some basic replacements because you will drop entire sizes of clothes. I went from a XXL to a L. Nothing stops you from wearing baggy shirts or a belt that keeps your jeans on, but 99% chance you will want proper fitting clothes that not just look how they should, but show off your progress. Sometimes it is hard to get rid of that favorite shirt that no longer fits, but you'll love the difference. 

3. Your weight loss will trigger others to want to do it. Personally, almost everyone in my family has taken up wanting to lose weight after seeing my progress. It will motivate others, even if they don't tell you. Prepare for a lot of questions, a lot of people you know wanting to start (and a good amount not doing it in a healthy way, you decide if you want to teach them how you did it or not), and sometimes, dealing with jealousy. 

4. It won't be as straight of a track as you'll plan for it to be. You will hit walls. You will maintain instead of losing even when you feel like you should be losing. You'll go ham on a special dinner. You'll give in to cravings. It's okay. You don't ruin progress by one meal, the average is what counts. In fact, if you go too hard on dieting and cut out all ""bad"" food, it isn't a question of if you will fail, it is a question of WHEN. 

5. At least for me, I forget the difference in how I look. When I go to the mirror I expect to look so fat, and still catch myself being like ""oh damn"". I'll go to put my hands on my hips and expect to make contact at a certain point, and I won't, my hips are smaller than that now. Pretty cool, and a reminder that you're on the right track or positive reinforcement that you've made that progress.

6. You'll dread hearing excuses from other people on why they can't lose weight. This goes hand in hand with #3. People will give a lot of excuses as to why they are heavy and cannot lose weight. They don't have time. They ate less once and it did nothing. They have bad genetics. Doesn't matter what it is, I can tell you that after you go through it and know just how possible it is through hard work and a frame of mind change, hearing others almost downplay your achievement by making excuses will most likely anger you because you know it isn't an excuse. 

I'd love to hear other's stories, perspectives, and thoughts on these points!",1646268221.0

So... I am 25f, 165 centimeters and weigh 85,6 as of today.
In my life I have lost over 20 kilos TWO times. The first time (2016) I lost 25 kilos in 6 months with weightlifting, but it went downhill FAST when I injured a knee when doing an obstacle course.
I also met my (then) boyfriend (now husband), started working as a CNA at a very stressful job and got my drivers license at the same time, and all of a sudden I was 85 kilos again... 

The second time (2019), I only adjusted my diet (CICO) combined with all the walking I did at the hospital at my working hours (like 20.000 steps each workday... crazy).
Then I got pregnant with my first child and allowed myself to indulge, a little too much...
Now my child is two and I feel BIG, like not fat, just big.
I have no muscles, I get out of breath just walking up the stairs to our apartment and I HATE this feeling.
I want to feel strong and able to do all the things I could before, like obstacle races and to bench my own weight at the gym.

So today I went to the gym for the first time in nearly 3 years.
My workout clothes didn't fit, my tights were literally stretched so much that I could see my panties, but f it, I went anyways.
And guys, I feel GREAT!

Just the feeling of having time to do something all by myself, listening to music, sweating, thinking, counting reps, adjusting weights...
It was awesome!

I did my favorite execises (The Big 5, as they call it), and that was enough.
Went home, showered and cooked dinner to my family.

I really hope this ""in love""-feeling stays, it feels so good.

Just wanted to tell you guys and keep myself accountable lol.
Have a great evening!

So when I do eat, I try to get a lot of food down so it will last longer. But recently Ive been doing this to the point of it just being ridiculous. 

2 weeks ago I ate so much, I almost puked on the trail while on my walk. Tonight I tried so hard not to eat a ton, but I did it again. I feel so sick. Its 3 hours later and I still feel sick. I cant even look at food, or I will gag right now. Im not sure why these fears are suddenly happening now for. I keep doing this with water also.

I will drink so much water I feel ill (like 5 glasses). Im scared of getting water poisoning.

I dont binge eat all the time, just 3 meals out of a week, but its getting more and more frequent. 

A lot of it, Im not even enjoying the food at all, its literally this fear of not having food and feeling dizzy. or not having food ready when Im hungry. 90% of the time I am not enjoying the food at all, but pushing it down, with this intense fear. 

Im tired of feeling sick from too much water or food. My stomach hurts and my body feels sluggish and tired when I do this. Has anyone else dealt with something like this. Its preventing me from losing anymore weight and its honestly scary feeling this sick from eating so much.

I've gained and lost the same 30lbs for the past 10 years, but never managed to maintain my lowest. When I hit my lowest ever (155lbs), I was barely eating and constantly exercising. I suspect my body refuses to go below a certain weight, but this flies in the face of what we all know from CICO: that if I just eat fewer calories, I can attain my goal weight. RIGHT?

Right now, I'm focusing on developing sustainable eating habits (smaller portions, more veg and protein, moderate treats, minimize bingeing and overeating -- I've been steadily losing for the past month) with the hope that I'll arrive at a new weight/relationship to eating and my body this way. 

Does anyone have reflections on this? I would love to hear everyone's experiences and thoughts from their journeys.

That said, I‚Äôd decided that when my calorie budget went below 1700, I would remove the 1500 minimum rule, which is where I am now. Additionally, since I live in Florida, summer starts in late February‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm now able to work swimming back into my daily exercise routine, which I did today.

This is where things get tricky: I don‚Äôt actually know if there‚Äôs such a thing as an appropriate or inappropriate number of net calories. I intend to maintain about this same level of exercise four or five days a week for the foreseeable future.

I‚Äôm going to start looking into this myself right now, but I figured a good first step would be to ask here. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",1646367884.0

Ive been big my entire life, I never was really super fat, but I never ever felt good or comfortable in my body, despite practicing taekwondo aince ive been 9.

Ive had Crash diets, yoyo effects and binge-eating phases since I was 13.

Approximately 6 months ago I decided to change. I started going to the gym regularly, watching what I eat etc.

I normally go to the gym 4 days a week, 2 hours each with 1.5 hours being Weight training and half an hour of cardio after.

My average daily calories are at about 1500-1600, and I eat mostly lean protein (Tuna, turkey, chicken, etc) and vegetables (mostly corn, spinach, carrots etc.)

I drink only water, around 3.5 -5 liters spread throughout the day.

Ive tried anything from 2200kcal a day to 1500kcal and somehow it does no f-ing difference to my weight and I dont understand.

I dont really gain weight eating 2200, but I dont really lose weight eating 1500.

And yeah I know practicing weight lifting this much means That some of the weight I dont lose is because of muscle being built, so I got my bodyfat% checked regularly and it has changed by 1% at most (23% to 22%)

I cant eat less than i do know or I just feel insanely bad, tired and weak the whole day, so that isnt really an option.

I dont understand it and its really frustrating. Do I just have a super-flexible metabolism that just adjusts to keep the weight I have (which js still from binge-phases years ago) at any calorie intake? (Does something like that even work???)

I am so desperate I tried everything the internet had to offer in terms of fat-loss pills and stuff, blew wayy to much money, heck I even hopped on sr9009 and cardarine just to lose weight, even though I always told myself Id stay natural, but Im just too miserable.

Does anyone have any tips for me? Were you in a similar situation before?

All tips I ever heard are to move more, eat more protein but I cant do any of that more than I am doing it rn, because Next to my gym i have a very physically demanding job, and pretty much everything I eat are proteins and fiber.

Please help a desperate soul,
thank you very much in advance!",1646329777.0

I'm 5'2"", 155 pounds, 28F. Pre-pandemic, I weighed like 125 pounds and it felt like a good spot for me. And during the first few months of the pandemic, I actually lost a little weight because I had more time to eat well and actually started to enjoy exercise for the first time in my life. 

Obviously that didn't last. I fell into a really bad depressive episode, and that, plus the merry-go-round of medications I tried (finally found something that works! yay!) has landed me here. I'm not laden with crippling depression anymore, but I still feel so defeated about this. I got so out of shape that even my ""easy"" exercise routines are impossible. I know you have to start low and slow, but it's so frustrating knowing that these things felt effortless in the past. 

Anyway, I'm working myself up into a spiral because there's a festival in town next weekend, and I'm going to see a lot of people I haven't seen since before the pandemic. I realize I'm not massively overweight or anything, but still, the shame bubbles up inside of me. I even made up an excuse to avoid meeting up with an old fling few weeks ago, just because I didn't want him to see me like this.

I posted a little over a month ago here and have been really consistent with creating new healthy habits and a combination of antidepressants kicking in and eating more protein has helped so so much! I've lost about 10 pounds (205-194) and I can really see and feel the difference especially in the face/stomach. I was only this heavy the past 3/4ish years (before 135) and I feel like for a very long time I really didn't *see* the weight gain, like I did, but my mind still was looking at how mg face used to look kinda. Anyway, now that I'm kinda on the track of losing consistently, I can actually see this extra weight and it's really discouraging and I feel almost more self conscious now than I did before - probably because I actually care now. Sure, it helps that a lot of my clothes are loose and being able to see changes and being able to push more doing more exercise and my relationship with food has improved so much! but it's so painful to look in the mirror still. I don't want to really fast track this weight loss journey (already doing about 1.8 lbs a week) but idk how to make my reflection more manageable if that makes sense?

I weigh myself every day as well. And if I know there‚Äôs gonna be a day I‚Äôll eat much or not know the calories (holidays, going out to eat) I will not eat much the days before.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have tried to diet and what an unhealthy relationship I have with diet, food, and my own body, but ‚Äî I‚Äôm here to try again! And hopefully, this time it will stick! I‚Äôve been poking around the loseit thread and y‚Äôall are all amazing. I‚Äôm really excited to join. 

I‚Äôm 25 yo, 5‚Äô4‚Äù and fluctuate around the 180 pound mark (usually landing at around 185 on the scale.) I‚Äôve been this weight for the past five years I want to say. Something close. Probably less my sophomore year of college. I‚Äôve varied in levels of fitness (I hike a lot) but recently hiking has gotten hard and my clothes don‚Äôt fit the same and now ‚Äî I just want to lose the weight despite my fitness level. My goal is to hit 140 lb. but honestly? Is just like to see some number on the scale that does not start with 18#. 179 would be a neat first start. 

I drink maybe once a week and it‚Äôs no more than one glass of wine. I do not drink soda. I walk around 10,000-12,000 steps a day and workout around once a week. Where the weight sneaks in for me, I would guess, is I tend to stress-eat shitty takeout meals, and I tend to default to sugary things (including sugary coffees), so I‚Äôm trying to rein that in. I haven‚Äôt meal prepped in a while but have finally gotten my groceries filled out and am hoping to get back into that. I am planning on trying to do a short workout regimen almost every day to get my heart rate going (and side note, I‚Äôd like to increase flexibility ‚Äî so I‚Äôm doing some yoga as well). 

I‚Äôve gotten my TDEE and I have a to-do list app where I‚Äôm going to journal my food (which I will then put into the my fitness pal, but I have a tendency to get annoyed by the searching for the right food etc. in the moment so I think this workaround will make me more likely to actually log it). Feeling hopeful! Started technically yesterday and feel pretty good! (Not that one day is amazing but, it‚Äôs a start). 

I‚Äôm a little worried about doing a whole lifestyle change at one time, but I‚Äôm also not sure how else to be more gradual about it. If anyone has better advice on this (or comments about how I‚Äôm trying to go about this) they‚Äôre very welcome and I‚Äôd love to hear it. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm new here, my goals are to overall drop 40 lbs (but my first hurdle I want to jump is to just break out of the 180lb. bracket and see 17# on the scale!) and here is how I‚Äôm planning on doing it. If others are in a similar boat ‚Äî great! If others have advice on how to best go about this ‚Äî also great! (And if this post somehow breaks the rules lmk and I‚Äôll delete it ‚Äî thanks!)

My question is: can I hit my goal while lifting heavy? I do low, heavy reps (8-10 per set) and use both machines and free weights. 

When I‚Äôm in a deficit I stick around 1000 calories (short girl problems) but should I go to maintenance? Will weights mess with my goal? 

I‚Äôm thinking of going up to 1300 with 100g protein. Any advice would be helpful!!! 

Thank you",1646351420.0

\- Female

\- 5'0""

\- 8.5 stone or 119lbs

I'm short and slim, not particularly curvy, tiny feet.  Naturally smaller build.

When I was younger I had a really hard time putting on weight and was always about 6.5 stone/91 lbs (too light, but never had any disordered eating and tried to put on weight).  I'm taking three medications: Sertraline, Mirtazapine and Yasmin birth control.  The medication has made me SUPER hungry, coupled with my age/metabolism and now working from home I noticed I put on weight quite quickly for the first time ever.

I'm currently 8.5 stone or 119lbs which is still small, I am not claiming to be overweight, however I'm now about 2 dress sizes up and most of my clothes don't fit, so I'm looking to lose a few lbs and then maintain a weight around 110lbs for fitness and preference.  I know the basics of weightloss e.g. calorie deficit and exercise but I'm no expert and I've never counted or dieted before.

Currently I'm eating around 1000 calories per day Mon-Fri, 2000 Saturday and Sunday.  I have a healthy and varied diet.  I completed couch - 5k during lockdown and now I'm exercising at the gym for about 45/60 mins 3 times per week, cardio & weights.

I started the above 3 weeks ago and I haven't lost any weight yet.  Two questions:

* Is it normal to take this long before seeing a difference
* Am I eating too little?  I based my intake on what the FitBit app said to do but when I check other calculators it recommends closer to 1500 calories per day to lose a few lbs.

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",1646345058.0

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

I played football in high school so I was lifting weights for about 5 years. This is also when I was my biggest. I lost a decent chunk my last year of high school and I was always up and down for the last few years in college but it wasn't until recently I seriously decided to lose ""the rest"" of the weight. 

When I first lost weight I set an initial goal of 200 just because. When I reached 200 I looked in the mirror and was happy with my results but I could see I could lose more so I set a new goal of 190. Now I'm 190 and going through the same thing. I can see some clear muscle definition, new veins/arteries poking out of my hands/arms but there's still definitely more I can lose around stomach area. 

The upper end of the ""healthy"" weight range I've seen is like 170-175 which just feels unrealistic for me (but maybe I'm just being skeptical because the last time I weighed that much I was probably a young teenager) I am a decently strong guy as I've lifted weights for many years (my current one rep max for bench/squat is 225/315 for reference), so I'm just kind of curious to hear from anyone else who has been in a similar situation that I am in. I'm concerned I'll keep setting new weight goals and eventually they'll be unrealistic and unhealthy.

I‚Äôve seen many people on here ask ‚ÄúWill people make fun of me when I go to the gym?‚Äù

The replies generally say something like, ‚ÄúNobody cares about you enough to make fun of you.‚Äù Which is true! Also, most people at gyms are really nice. I think the myth of mean gym people was something Planet Fitness invented as a marketing tactic.

However, I realized that answer is not entirely helpful for people who have never been to a gym. It can be a legitimate concern.

I‚Äôve been a gym regular for about a decade now, and I wanted to share some actionable steps you can take in the unlikely event someone does make fun of you at the gym.

**The most important thing** is that you keep your workout going and keep going to the gym on your terms. You‚Äôre taking a bold step for your health and fitness, and you shouldn‚Äôt let any jerks get in your way.

Here‚Äôs what you can do:

1. **Politely talk to the jerk:** Most people are not jerks, and if you think someone is making fun of you, it‚Äôs more likely that there‚Äôs a misunderstanding. Maybe they‚Äôre waiting for the machine you‚Äôre using or admiring your outfit. If someone is actually being a jerk, politely confronting them can completely shut them down. Most jerks aren‚Äôt used to being confronted.
2. **Let it slide:** Letting it go might feel like a hit to your ego, but this is actually the most powerful thing you can do. It builds your own resilience and it robs jerks of their power. As the proverb goes, ""If you wish to avoid stepping on thorns, it's easier to wear sandals than it is to cover the world in leather.""
3. **Talk to gym staff and management:** If option 1 or 2 don‚Äôt work, politely inform the gym staff. Most gyms take harassment seriously because it‚Äôs bad for business. If someone is a stubborn jerk who won't let up, good gyms have no qualms in cancelling their membership. The odds that you get to step 3 are immensely low and you're likely dealing with a troubled individual at this point, so don't let it get in your way.
4. **Go somewhere else:** If the gym does nothing about the jerk and the jerk persists, then it‚Äôs not a good gym and it doesn‚Äôt deserve your money. The best thing to do is to go to a gym that has better rules for its members.

If you've never been to a gym and you're considering going, know that many gym members will respect you for being there. Nobody will stop to cheer you on, but they will silently be giving you props in their head.

My (46m) face says it all. The first picture was taken 10 months ago. The second, last week.

I might as well be an entirely different person. And it's not just the weight. My face. Just look at my face. I was anxiety-ridden, dealing with low-grade depression, full of stress, unhealthy. My knees ACHED when I walked and killed me when I knelt down.

It was about that time when I decided to do a little walk before I'd log in for work. (We were all WFH due to COVID until last summer.) I was tired of feeling that awful seltzer-feeling in my heart when turning on my machine. I needed to be able to relax my mind beforehand.

So, those little walks before logging in got longer. Then daily. Eventually, I downloaded the Couch-to-5k (C25k) app. I started doing little jogs here and there.

I changed the way I ate. I stopped stress eating. My body didn't want junk. Eventually, my drinking went from three glasses of wine DAILY to maybe a cocktail once a week.

I felt my mental health improve. That was the most noticeable--and most important--first change. I didn't really start look like I lost any weight until a few months past that.

My libido went from 0 to 11. My confidence increased significantly. Things I'd just suck up and deal with become deal-breakers. My writing improved. My ability to present at work was dynamic.

I really started looking like I lost weight four months later. Pants no longer fit me. My face thinned out. My gut turned into a pooch.

Something popped in December and now it's \*very\* noticeable that my body is different. I'm nearing the levels of strength I had in my 20s. I'm almost getting sick of hearing about how much weight I lost.

I'm not at goal yet. But right now, I'm less concerned about numbers as I am about performance and body composition. I intend--yes INTEND--on being shredded this summer. It's become more of a mental exercise than physical. I want to prove to myself that it's possible because I believe it is possible.

Seriously, folks. If I can do this, literally ANYONE can. I'm a father of kids, so yes I know that this is a stressor. Yes, I've dealt with mental illness--but even with meds, there is no better supplement than exercise. Yeah, I know you have no time--but you can make time.

It's totally possible. I am literally **NOT THE SAME PERSON** I was in that first picture.

About me: I lost 21kg in 2018/19 but gained it all back when I went to hospital for ten months in 2020/21. At the end of 2021 I lost 14kg in nine weeks because of another hospital stay because I was poorly and hardly ate. Now I want to maintain this weight and gain back the muscle I lost, and I was going for a loose CICO. I‚Äôm managing okay even without counting every calorie, but my doctor recommended a dietician so I went there. 

The dietician said it wasn‚Äôt only CICO but the kind of calories you eat matter. Some foods cause a different insulin response than others, and this affects fat burning. Essentially, she said it does make a difference what kind of food you eat. I remember something like this from when I studied human biology, but I‚Äôve not done any biology for a few years now, so can‚Äôt quite remember. 

So, could the dietician have a point? Even if it gives me a few more calories to eat per day I‚Äôd like to know. What do you think?",1646218050.0

I eat an average of 1360-1650 cals per day, TDEE is 1950 at sedentary but BMR is around 1600 so I try to stay above that. It doesn‚Äôt always work. I also try to get at least 100g of protein, but otherwise don‚Äôt pay super close attention to macros. 

I work a full time desk job and so am pretty sedentary. I play soccer once a week, and ski once a week in winter/try to hike once a week in summer. I also just started training for a 10k taking place at the end of May, though it‚Äôs super low mileage at the beginning. 

I‚Äôm trying to get more steps in, in part to justify the cost of the treadmill I bought for the 10k training lol. I also recently look at [losertown](https://www.losertown.org/eats/cal.php) and saw that if I am ‚Äúlightly active 1-3 days a week‚Äù I will reach my goal weight in nearly half the time than if I‚Äôm sedentary. 

All of this is to ask, how many steps per day is still considered sedentary? At what point would I be able to consider myself lightly active? I‚Äôm not planning on increasing calories based on activity level, just trying to space my TDEE and BMR out a bit more so I can increase my deficit without risking undereating.

and I have fat voice, when I do voice calls with my online friends they could tell right away that I am a fat person, which makes me very self conscious, I became the most quiet person, always muting myself on voice chats because of it. and when I do open the mic, I'd try my best to make my voice sound  little less fat (dont know if the effort works). 

This affects my singing voice as well, when I sing, people told me i sound on the heavier side. been fat my entire life. 

my question, any of you that succesfully lost massive amount of weight and you knew for certain you had ""Fat Voice"". after you lost all that weight, did your voice changed as well?


EDIT: Hello, thank you for everyone's concern, but My friends are nice people, being assh*les to each other is just part of how our friendship goes, they've helped me through tough times, ordered and send foods and drinks to my house. sometimes I'm also an assh*le to them. it is just this 1 thing that stucked in my mind. 

and about the fat voice, alot of people said no such thing exists, i'd like to differ, my voice sounds fat, and I can tell if someone else is fat too, and when i see them, i'm right, theres just something about our tones that gives it away.

another example is, if you look at cartoons, most of the fat characters have that ""Fat voice"". bold, round sounding. (I've done pretty good job on hiding it i think, but when I get serious and talk loud, it would come out) for example, Peter Griffin from family guy, Mrs Puff from Spongebob, Eunice Pound from The video game Bully, I wouldnt be able to imagine his/her voice on a skinny or muscular fit person, but i'd be able to on another guy his/her size.  (I know their voice actress and actors arent necessarily fat. but they know how to alter their voice to make it sound fat)

Another alternative for Fat Voice, is ""Strongmen"" Voice. this type of voice is of people who are big fat but also muscular at the same time, for example https://youtu.be/YLkV1VGqYP8 all of them sound how I'd imagine a strongmen would sound, they sound very very similar, their tones and such.",1646191721.0

For context: I‚Äôm a tattoo artist. I often start my day with something healthy like a smoothie or a protein shake, and when I go to work, I fall apart midday by not eating. Then I overdo it in the evenings. Even when I pack a meal, I will often forget to eat it if I‚Äôm in the zone. This is less likely when I have quick snacks like nuts, babybel cheeses, or an orange, so I think the problem is when I bring a full on entree to work. I just rarely have the time for more than something quick and sustaining when I‚Äôm in the groove of it all.

That leaves me wondering what fits in the venn diagram of small, healthy, sustaining snacks/meals that take little effort to prepare.

Obviously french fries and potato chips are not great for weight loss or health if eaten in excess, along with any potato dish with a ton of added fat, but this goes for all ingredients. Cooked correctly, potatoes are tasty and incredibly filling per calorie. Mashed potatoes made with broth taste incredible. Steamed potatoes are a great alternative to rice or bread. Baked potatoes with low calorie toppings feel like a treat. Potato salad with yoghurt instead of mayo is so satisfying. They fill you up and taste great and are lower calorie than rice or bread or pasta. They've become an important part of my weight loss toolkit. If you don't eat potatoes already you should totally look into it.

EDIT: Forgot to mention. I had the chance to try some heirloom potatoes a while back and they blew me away. Incredible flavor and texture, I simply steamed them and devoured with just salt and pepper.",1646200510.0

So I've had this question on my mind for years and still can't find a solid answer and I feel like my logic is sound in my thought process. 

So, in the eternal pursuit of getting lean, I've calculated time and time again my maintenance calories. What I'm curious about though, is should my maintenance calories be calculated at lean body mass or total body mass? I've never been able to find anything online explicitly stating that it is either of them, but my thinking is that since body fat accounts for a minimal amount of daily energy expenditure, it might not be needed to be taken into account.

So my thinking leads me to believe that if I weigh 100kg at 20% BF, should I calculate my maintenance at 100kg (total body weight) or 80kg (lean body mass). It seems like a large discrepancy since at such a weight and BF% and can lead to quite a disparity in maintenance calorie calculations. 

In my head I can see arguments for both, but it's just something I've never found a solid answer for.

I'm 24M and weight around 218 pounds. I was really skinny all my life and by mid 2017 I started to gain weight and use food as a means to cope with me problems, which was shifting to a new place and being sexually abused in my childhood it made things very difficult. Food was the only means I was able to take onn. Prior to that I tried killing myself, self harm, overdosing but after few months of binging on food I started gaining weight soon and things were not that bad but since pandemic and lockdown my parents started pointing me out about how fat and ugly I'm becoming. (I live with my mom, aunt and her parents. Dad works overseas) so they both kept humiliating me every single day. They would call up my 5 year old cousin and tell her to give some sense into me to exercise and lose some weight. And soon all my younger brothers and sisters call me names both as a joke and when serious, saying how fat I have become, or how I look like a disgusting giant animal. My parents would tell me they are getting a headache by looking at me or they feel disgusting looking at my body. 

And I definitely agree with them. I hate myself and my body too, I have tried many times destroying myself physically. 

Maybe I can't take it anymore or maybe I'm feeling guilty. But it does hurt. I am already living my day to day life with soo much to deal with. Things just keep growing more, now every time I wake up or my mom or aunt see me they just say it to my face, look how disgusting your body is looking. Don't you feel a little shame on yourself.

I also have a gf we're in a ldr, and when I told her all this she was very supportive of me at first but now I feel like she's simply pretending to not have a problem with me. If I say her that I didn't eat any junk food for a day. She appreciates me and if I say her I had some as I couldn't control myself. She replies with an OK.

I am aware that all the problem lies within me, only if I was not fat and stopped binging on food and got some work out to do things will be better and these people are only looking out for me in their own way, I know it's my fault.

I'm simply here to share this I don't mean to complain about my parents or my girlfriend. I have always been a suicidal maniac. I'm trying everyday to get better or atleast not act upon my suicidal thoughts. 

I cannot afford therapy or anything. It's just how things will be for me I guess.

Generally it was going well until December and ever since then it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been stuck in a binge eating cycle from hell and I‚Äôm honestly at the point where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve been using the TDEE spreadsheet from the site and tracking and weighing all my food and it‚Äôs clearly worked. Currently my TDEE is coming up at about 2100 so I‚Äôve been trying to eat 1500 a day but the past 3 months, it just hasn‚Äôt been working üôàüôàüôà

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my work stress or anxiety that‚Äôs picked up but I literally cannot stop eating. I‚Äôve spent ridiculous amounts on food, money I don‚Äôt have to be buying junk food but it‚Äôs all I crave. I try and eat better but then 30 min later it turns into a binge fest and I know I should stop but I just can‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt want to be fat anymore. I don‚Äôt wanna be unhealthy and it felt like I was doing so well and now I just feel lost and like I‚Äôm never gonna succeed.

I‚Äôm sorry, I feel like such a whiny mess when people have real problems and mine is just like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop shovelling food into my face‚Äù üôàüôàüôà

Can anyone help or give me any advice as to how to move forward? Please I can‚Äôt carry on like this.",1646236433.0

I am new to the world of cooking and in an effort to lose weight have realized I can't/shouldn't live off of frozen chicken nuggets.

I sat down to make scrambled eggs this morning and buttered the skillet. This is going to sound dumb but keep in mind I'm a rookie. When calorie tracking am I counting the butter or oil I use in a skillet too? Or is it like how alcohol used in cooking kind of burns out? Help please.",1646220318.0

I've made really great gains in muscle/strength, and have managed to get to the lowest body fat % in probably 20 years.

I guess I over did it on leg presses or something. I had a left inguinal hernia repair with mesh done about 10 years ago, and now my right side has herniated.

I pretty much have to stop doing any kind of exercise. I have an appointment with surgeon in 5 days, and surgery will probably be in > 3 weeks. PCP says if it starts to hurt, or feel like i've pinched my guts, I probably need to throw in the towel and head to the ER for emergency repair. I'd prefer to wait it out and let my surgeon (has done several other surgeries in last 3 years) do it because I trust her and I want it done right.

So, what do I do to minimize the impact being sedentary for the next 5-6 weeks will cause? Figure out what my basil caloric rate is for a sedentary lifestyle and try and hit it? Minimize fatty foods? I'm really frustrated. I had a good thing going and I feel like all of my momentum just evaporated.

Would this be a good time to fast to try and shed some body fat?",1646262485.0

My job is fairly active - if I remember to wear my watch it shows that on a typical work day I will get around 3k-4K steps with some days being lower or higher of course. On the weekends I hike and skate. I have recently cleared out my home gym so it is usable again but I don‚Äôt lift yet. 


I count my calories and weigh everything. My current goal is to do 1475 per day with emphasis on high protein, which has been very difficult to reach for me.

This week I have counted calories and I have gained a pound every single day. I don‚Äôt understand what changed because the weight used to fall off. 


I do have hormonal issues that are supposedly under control with medications but I just feel like this can‚Äôt be normal.

t524wu,"The more weight I lose, the more scared I am of gaining weight.",,2,0.59,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t524wu/the_more_weight_i_lose_the_more_scared_i_am_of/,3,"I‚Äôve been on my weight loss journey for about 5 months and I‚Äôve lost 20 pounds so far! I‚Äôm very proud of myself not just for losing weight, but getting my bingeing more in control, too. Recently though, I‚Äôve been really scared of gaining weight. Every time I step on the scale I‚Äôm scared that the number will be the same or higher. This has become such an issue for me that I rarely weigh myself because I‚Äôd rather just not even take the risk of seeing that higher number. Whenever I weigh myself and see that I‚Äôve lost weight, I immediately get worried that I‚Äôll gain it back. I should be proud of myself and feel good, but instead I start to stress over whether or not I‚Äôll be able to keep it off.

For about the first 4 months of my weight loss journey I ate around 1,200 calories at a height of about 5‚Äù8.5‚Äô/174 cm (F18). I chose this number because I remember reading somewhere a few years back that said the minimum calories required for an adult woman are about 1,200. I took this number and ran with it. In about the first 2 months I lost 13-14 pounds. After seeing this amazing progress, I wanted to just keep losing. At the beginning of 2022 however, I started experiencing lightheadedness, hair loss, fatigue, irritability and more, like I hadn‚Äôt experienced before. Sure, I had felt lightheaded and sometimes dizzy for months by now but it suddenly got much worse.

Since I had the holidays off from school in December and the beginning of the year I had a lot of time, so I began walking 8-10 miles a day on the treadmill. I continued to eat about 1,200 cals during this time. After this period of time is when I started to notice hair loss and lightheadedness more often than I‚Äôd experienced before. I decided to up my calorie intake to about ~1,500 cals but I feel guilty a lot of the time for eating more because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll gain weight back or I‚Äôll stop losing/plateau. 

I feel stuck. I definitely want to lose weight and I definitely don‚Äôt want to damage my health, but I can‚Äôt seem to find a healthy balance. If I eat more food or try not to walk as much everyday, I more often than not feel guilty, like I‚Äôm not doing enough to lose weight anymore. I‚Äôve been eating closer to my BMR, so around ~1,600 cals a day, and only walking about 3-4 miles a day. Last time I weighed myself I did lose weight but every time I‚Äôm just afraid that I‚Äôll gain it back. I want to see my progress so I know that what I‚Äôm doing is working, but I‚Äôm scared of not seeing any/enough.

I‚Äôve been overweight for my entire life; many times being ‚Äúskinny‚Äù or a healthy/normal weight even seemed unobtainable or ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù in a way. Now that I‚Äôm getting closer to a normal weight range and starting to see changes in my body, it‚Äôs hard not to be scared that I‚Äôll lose it since I‚Äôve never had it before. I want to be able to be happy with my body, and have a good relationship with food and I definitely don‚Äôt want to develop an eating disorder. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person who‚Äôs been afraid of gaining weight after losing it, so it‚Äôd be really nice to hear from anyone that has any tips, insight, thoughts, their own experiences, etc. 

TL;DR- I‚Äôve been seeing progress in my weight loss but I‚Äôm constantly afraid that I‚Äôll gain weight back/not be able to keep it off. I‚Äôve started to eat more (closer to my BMR requirement) and exercise less, but I often feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough to lose weight. I‚Äôm scared to weigh myself because I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôve gained or not lost much weight. I‚Äôve been overweight my entire life and the closer I get to a healthy weight or looking thinner I get more scared that I‚Äôll go back to how I was, or I won‚Äôt be able to keep the weight off. Anyone else experience this during their weight loss journey? How have you overcome these fears? (Also sorry for the really long post lol)",1646233672.0

I have a fairly flat stomach, and it's been fairly easy to get down. Around my core, it's a healthy size, and I'm comfortable with it. The problem is, I'm still overweight for my height, and it's all in my thighs. 

I've tried working out my thighs for a few days just with stuff like squats and lunges, but I suddenly found really bad stretch marks, so I think it's just building muscle without getting rid of the fat, and just making them bigger. So I need to tackle that first. 

Is it possible to do that? Because so far whenever I lose any weight, it's just my waist that gets smaller, but I don't want to wait for my core to be completely devoid of any fat at all before I lose it on my thighs. 

I'm new to this, I've never had to diet before, but I've started gaining weight over the past few years of university that I need to get rid of before it turns into a big problem. I was very active in highschool, but most of my time now is just at my desk working on assignments, and I didn't adjust my diet accordingly. 

Sorry if this is long and rambley, but I wanted to ask someone. I don't know anyone that is in to fitness, other than an ex that I would rather jump out of a seventh story window than ask advice from. My thighs have been bugging me for a while, and I'm trying really hard to keep it healthy and no go extreme on this weight loss. I did stop eating do a fair while, and I lost a lot of weight, but I had to actively force myself to eat before it turned into a disorder, and (predictively) it all came back immediately. 


TL;DR, I am wondering if there is any way to lose weight in specifically my thighs, in a healthy way that doesn't allow me to slip back into starvation mode or over exercising to the point of exhaustion.

t4xq3r,"‚òÖOFFICIAL DAILY‚òÖ Day 1? Start here! March 02, 2022",‚òÖ Official Daily ‚òÖ,6,0.76,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t4xq3r/official_daily_day_1_start_here_march_02_2022/,1,"# Is today is your Day 1?

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

I‚Äôm a 17 year old girl, 5 foot 5 and I weigh 143 lbs (about 65 kg). I‚Äôm not FAT as such but I‚Äôm definitely not thin and honestly I‚Äôm at the end of my tether with my weight/body image issues.

Before my thyroid condition was diagnosed about three years ago, my metabolism was so fast that I was able to eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and literally not gain weight. However when I was diagnosed and put on medication this wasn‚Äôt the case, but I was already too deep into those habits at the time for me to stop so I just continued my (what I now realise was) binging and the weight just caught up to me. Since then I‚Äôve been stuck in a constant binge-restrict cycle and not got anywhere with it.

About two or so months ago I lost a lot of weight very quickly due to eating next to nothing every day and over exercising. I realised this had to stop as it was getting quite bad but since that period I‚Äôve put on even more weight than I was to begin with by trying to eat ‚Äònormally‚Äô.

My biggest problem now is the binge eating. I try so hard to eat healthy and exercise, some days I do really well, but I get maybe a week? and then I just binge and ruin everything. The guilt afterwards is the absolute worst part, I just feel so awful for eating so much.

I just really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve tried and tried to just lose weight in a healthy way but it seems like the only way I lose at all is by high restriction. I still obsess over calories and it‚Äôs so draining, and it‚Äôs especially frustrating that I don‚Äôt lose any weight for it. 
I‚Äôm so constantly fed up, I feel ugly and fat all the time and have little to no self confidence. None of the boys fancy me or anything and I feel like with this extra weight I am genuinely so so unattractive. My entire friend group are all small and slim and unfortunately I‚Äôm taller and just generally bigger so I stick out like a sore thumb. My mum likes to say I‚Äôm just ‚Äòcurvy‚Äô and everyone tells me to stop trying to lose weight but I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be happy until I do, I really hate how I look.

Please, if anyone knows how to stop the binging and actually lose weight without falling back into the extreme restriction please let me know! I‚Äôm sorry this was all so negative and I really am trying, I eat very healthy and exercise a lot apart from the weekly binging and I can‚Äôt stop it :( thank you in advance for any replies.

Oh and please don‚Äôt just tell me to get some self control or whatever, trust me, I have tried!!",1646256515.0

I'm currently 164cm tall as well. I am pretty happy with my body currently but I would like to lose a bit of fat from my hips and possibly my bust as well. I have a formal in September and I would like to have lost about 5 kilos by then, possibly more but I don't necessarily mind weighing a bit, it's just for aesthetic reasons lol.

I cycle for about 1 - 3 hours every night after school, i've done that for the past month and I love it. I know most weight loss comes from diet and my family eats a REALLY healthy diet so I'm not worried about that, but i do have a tendency to overeat (I eat really fast) so I decided to count calories about six weeks ago. It was alright in the beginning but I started to get really obsessed with the numbers and if I ate over then I would go and run it off and I knew it could end up going really bad so I stopped last week. i have since been focusing on snacking less and eating slower so I know if I'm actually full or not.

I have seen progress in the last month, my stomach is slightly flatter and I used to weigh about 66 six weeks ago (but then again it changes almost daily). Also my legs are quite a bit stronger lol.

I am just looking for tips to slowly and healthily lose a bit of weight, and sustainably so I don't put it back on.

Also, just out of curiosity how long should i stick with it to see proper results?

thank you!

In the past, I would let one day of overeating turn into a week or more of binging. It's a huge reason why I used to be very overweight.

I did eat around 5000 calories yesterday, but today I ate normally and didn't try to punish myself by not eating or thinking that I messed up and binging some more.

I understand that I probably set myself back by a week, but a week is better than spiraling and setting myself back by months.

Yes, I ate too much yesterday, but I enjoyed the food. I still ate breakfast today and lunch; I will also be eating dinner. I will exercise a little--not as a punishment, but because I want to and have a bit of an energy boost from yesterday.

To anyone reading this who struggles with binging--yes, it does get better! I hated when people kept on saying that to me, but it's true. Yes, you still might overeat, but you'll notice the amount of food you eat during those times decreasing. Eventually, one day of overeating will just become that: one day.

t58w3z,How do you calculate calories in home cooked meals with leftovers?,Question,0,0.5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t58w3z/how_do_you_calculate_calories_in_home_cooked/,19,"Hello! 

Typically when I cook a meal, I add a new recipe to LoseIt with all of the ingredients. I put the finished meal into a container to get the weight in grams. The following day I just weigh the amount of grams when I eat leftovers, which automatically calculates the currently calories/macros for me.

I noticed a few issues with this process:

* Recipes are rarely 1:1, so every time I cook a new meal I need to create a new recipe. This makes the app bloat pretty quick.
* I noticed some of my containers are getting [hot/melting](https://i.redd.it/2egsl9fcbvq71.jpg) when doing this, which I'm not super comfortable with the idea of that ending up in my food.
* It's a little time consuming/tedious to do consistently, so I don't always follow through.

More recently I've taken to eyeballing portions instead (split leftovers into 3 meals, cut the total calories into thirds) but I realize this isn't accurate and it still requires me to add all of the ingredients as a recipe.

So anyway, how do you handle this? I'm looking to optimize my workflow lol",1646251577.0

t50g6e,Help with MFP. Any suggestions?,Question,3,0.72,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t50g6e/help_with_mfp_any_suggestions/,4,"So far I have lost 15 kg. Originally I started with very active  on my calories and lost 7kg initially. Afterwords I plateaued and  changed this to lightly active, managing to remove the residual 8kg. Now  I haven't been able to remove any more weight at all since then.

Some  background about me, I work in a lab all day and have an average of  10-11k steps per day, I do a strenuous gym workout everyday with a 40  min boxing workout every other day. I don't count my step calories in  MFP but I do count my workout routine calories on there (I know this  overestimates but I haven't had an issue with it thus far). It should be  noted that I have not changed my routine (steps or workout wise since  the very beginning) so it is strange to me that I even had to lower it  from very active to lightly active in the first place. My stats are that  I'm 6'5 and 101kg, I'm also trying to limit the speed of my weight loss  because I'm trying to retain my muscle mass I put on from my bulk  although my goals have been set to lose 0.75 kg a week on MFP (I  definitely have not dropped weight anywhere near this quickly, it's been  almost 8 months and I've only dropped 15 kg.)

I  am surely in a calorie deficit as I'm extremely tired all the time and  struggling to find the energy to do things. Potentially I am  undereating? I am ridiculously hungry all the time (moreso than during  the loss of my past kg's which I found particularly easy). I changed it  to no activity level but I'm worried I'll end up undereating far more  than I might already be so that's not an approach I wish to pursue.

My current approach is now working out but not adding any of the calories at all.

I have calculated by TDEE to be 2100ish so I'm shooting for a 1600 calorie limit every day. I read that a 500 calorie deficit is a sustainable, realistic goal. But I'm also working out now and burn about 500 calories per workout. Does that mean I should still aim for 1600 calories or do I add my 500 cal workout expenditure to my daily limit?

I use a garmin watch so it shows my goal (1600) - food consumed (usually 1600) + (workout AND standard daily activity which is around 1000) = so I'm ending each day around 1000 calories under. I hope that makes sense and isn't too obvious of a question.

t4u2lg,How to have a healthier relationship with food,Vent/Rant,7,0.82,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t4u2lg/how_to_have_a_healthier_relationship_with_food/,3,"So it's like past midnight and I just caved and ate instant noodles (for the first time in a while since I rarely eat ramen) but now I feel so guilty and kind of disgusted with myself. I think for the last 3 or 4 years I've had a really unhealthy relationship with food. I gained like 10lbs over the course of undergrad and I've been struggling to lose it, except I've been saying that for the last 4 years and have only gained weight. Recently I think I've been more serious about trying to lose weight in a healthy way and building up healthy lifestyles. However, I'm still having a really hard time.

I think my biggest issue is that I CONSTANTLY think about food. I'm always thinking about what my next meal is, or if I'm still within my calorie limit for the day, or if I haven't reached my limit what else I can eat a little of. Most people I know just eat when they're hungry and they don't constantly think about food like I do, which I feel like is probably the normal and healthy thing to do, but I just don't know how they do that.

Another thing that contributes to this issue is that my schedule is highly variable. I'm still in school so my daily schedule is constantly changing. Some days I have time for a meal at a normal lunch and dinner time, other days I can only eat at some random hour in the afternoon and not have time for more food until ridiculously late. This makes it so that I have to think like ""oh I NEED to eat at 3pm or else I will starve until 9pm. I have to work out at 8pm so I can't wait until afterwards or else I'll have no energy for that."" It's these kinds of scheduling things that kind of stress me out too.

I'm kind of at a loss for what to do. How do I stop constantly thinking about food. The ramen thing also kind of happened because I was thinking about it for like the last two hours and I finally caved. I literally was not even hungry. What are steps that I can take to have a healthier relationship with food, how to not beat myself up over cheat meals/unhealthy cravings that I cave to, or even just stay on track to be healthy?

EDIT: Regarding my goal and current weight/BMI: I've always been pretty lanky so 115lbs is a pretty reasonable number for me since that was also the weight that I maintained the longest when I didn't use to have such a bad relationship with food. It's a pretty arbitrary number and I'm more interested in gaining more healthy habits with eating and exercise rather than making that weight my ultimate goal. I feel like if I met my heathy eating and exercise habit goals I'll probably end up around that number anyway since that really is just how my body is. 

(This is from a reply to a comment below but I feel like this elaborates on stuff from my original post): I ended up gaining weight because of some pretty bad eating habits the past year or so where my weight increased by 5lbs because of things like binge eating an entire loaf of bread at midnight.

The ramen thing was bad because I don't think eating a bowl of ramen at 3am because I'm stressed about work is normal or healthy. I've stopped binge eating at ridiculously late hours of the night/right before bed because I feel pretty gross having to sleep with a full stomach. However, I still have some pretty bad eating habits like constantly eating until I'm stuffed, having like 3 dinners because I'm in a snacky mood even though I'm not actually hungry, or eating a bunch of unhealthy stuff (pastries, chocolate, other carbs) instead of real meals. These are the kinds of things I'm trying to work on but honestly it's so hard when I'm just constantly thinking about my meals or thinking about my schedule for the day and how food fits into the picture.

I'm trying to be better about not constantly thinking about food and actually learning to eat when I'm truly hungry and not because I'm bored or tired or just procrastinating on doing something productive. I'm also exercising more which is a pretty good step in the right direction since I used to almost never exercise. I think if I got my bad eating habits",1646203573.0

This time I started at around 116.2 kg in June and quickly lost 4 kg, then it started plateauing when I didn't maintain my diet well. I'm going to count December as my starting point though, since thats when I renewed my efforts.

In December, I weighed 111.3 kg. I then gained a kg, after which I started losing weight for 4 weeks in a row, very slowly (0.3 kg a week). The past two weeks, however, I've gained 0.1 kg a week.

I've been going to the gym 4-5 times a week for 2 months now, usually doing 10-15 minutes of cardio and 45-90 minutes of lifting. I eat 2100 calories a day, but for the first month it was generally 2400 calories. I try to get atleast 140 g of protein each day, which means I'm usually deficit in carbohydrates. I track everything with the app LoseIt and always try to make sure everythings correct.

I'm 19, 185 cm tall and currently weigh 111.1 kg, at 32.9% body fat and 34.7% muscle mass (according to my scale, which doesn't measure body fat and muscle well). I exercise 4-5 times a week for 90 minutes on average, keeping my heartrate about 130 on average. The days between the gym I'm practically sedentary (2000 steps or so), and on the days I go I usually get around 6000 steps. On average this equals to 31000 steps a week. Calculating my TDEE (counting it as light exercise on average) I get a TDEE of around 2700 calories, meaning I should lose somewhere in the ballpark of 0.6 kg each week, but I don't.

This period has been my first where I try to properly go to the gym and build muscle, and I've heard beginners can gain a lot of muscle in the beginning. I also know I'm gaining muscle as my muscles are harder, more defined, and I'm about 50% stronger now than I was before. I'm even getting stretch marks around my muscles - so something is happening. [Here's a comparison of my arm, when it's idle](https://i.imgur.com/rOlCPTf.jpg) and [when it's flexed.](https://i.imgur.com/HDbW4fV.jpg) Left is two months ago, right is yesterday.

This week I ate 2100 calories every day, except 3 days where I overate by 300 calories. This should, evened out over a week, equate to a 0.4 kg weight loss, but I gained 0.1 kg instead.

I hope someone can shed some light on this. I'd be happy to respond to any questions if more information is needed.

Thank you for reading my post and I hope you have a great day ‚ù§",1646210135.0

Thank you all for the love and support! I have gotten quite a lot of messages asking how I do it, etc. I did answer this in another comment, but honestly I don't exercise really at all aside from walking my dogs and some stretching for my back pain.  I use the loseit! app/website and track my food. That is really it!   


The only thing that has made this whole thing work is tracking everything and being completely honest with myself about what I am eating. I lied to myself for a very very long time about the content and volume of what I ate. No more. that isn't to say I didn't ever 'backslide'.  I went over the budgeted calories some days (and some weeks), but we face that head on and keep moving in the right direction even if there are little hiccups.

And 2 lbs away from another. I haven't been super consistent and restrictive but I am very conscious of what and how much I eat lately. Last year I was calorie counting and lifting. My weight did not drop much but inches did. Currently I am 10 lbs lighter than I was this time last year. This go I have just been trying to eat intuitively. I don't snack anymore and if I eat a meal, it is always high protein with veggies. Usually twice a day within a 4-6 hour window. And if I want something not so healthy I will eat it (not a full meal) but I don't do it daily and I don't have much of a desire for junk anymore. I have noticed how certain foods effect me the older that I get and it is not worth it.

Anyway, I can finally see it in my face and clothes. I am two sizes down. I can't see my body shrinking but I have successfully maintained a 30-40 lbs loss over the last year and a half.

Also, guys, I completely missed the month transition. I forgot (how, I do not know) that February is a short month. So let‚Äôs do a wrap up here, shall we? Here‚Äôs the sign up post: 

https://redd.it/t4okc2 

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra & remind self that it‚Äôs a number not a self-worth estimate: Not happy here. I want to say something nice to myself about all this because I can‚Äôt tell you all to extend empathy to yourself first if I don‚Äôt. So. I tried. And I will do better in the days, weeks & months ahead.   

1800-2000 calories a day, do not adjust for exercise: Did not do great here. I'm not happy with the realization that I am, in fact, up ten pounds from where I started this year. I won‚Äôt waste my time or energy shaming myself because I can use that same energy to do better tomorrow.   

Exercise 5 days a week (strength work/tbar swings 3 days a week): Good here. I‚Äôd like to do more strength work in the month ahead. 20/28 days. 

Writing project and/or journaling -1,666 words a day: I‚Äôve done some good work here. This & therapy go hand in hand & are important to my mental health in a big big way.  

Todays gratitude list: Proof that sometimes the brightest parts of life are indeed the simple joys like sun warmed cat/dog/misc pet fur.   

Express intention (day, week, month or moment): I'm still feeling a bit adrift but I do think this is helping. 

Long story short, I‚Äôm going to keep swimming like Dory. I‚Äôm going to reexamine how I‚Äôve been approaching food. I think returning to my earlier methods where I felt more in control & successful maybe a good idea. So I'll be meal prepping breakfasts again & seeking a more balanced meal approach.

so, today was pancake day in the UK. the mentality that eating better or for your goals has to be boring has always bothered me; hanging around other chats and seeing people gasp in horrified despair ""how can you live without donuts!?"" when someone says they're eating better. the sad statement from a colleague that for the next 2 months they can have 'nothing nice'. 

thus, for myself I launched Operation Pancake. could I have pancakes for every meal today and still fit it within my goals?

and the answer is a resounding yes. (disclaimer: it's not a very veggie heavy day. rest assured, I get plenty of veggies on other days). 

breakfast was crepes; 4 crepes (plain flour, wunda milk alternative, egg, 10g pea protein) with cheese (eat lean's smoked) and fake beef (taste & glory's no beef strips)
lunch was mock duck pancakes; admittedly lazily in a pack from asda
then dinner, american pancakes: banana, egg, chocolate whey, and oats. 

for a whopping 1378 calories and 115g of protein. perfectly in my calorie budget, exceeding my protein goal. 

the point of this isn't (as it may look) to brag. it's to say: you can eat fun stuff. you can be silly. it's not that you can never have a day where you sit in bed and eat a papa john's pizza, but if you want to do weird stuff on the regular, it can fit your goals. your diet works for you, you're not under the unbending iron fist of kale (which also has its place).

Is it actually possible?
If so, what are the factors? I mean eg. there is someone with a low TDEE, and underweight is it more likely to happen?
And let's say it's real. So they gain weight from them original TDEE. Can they eat that quantity again without gaining weight as before, or they will keep gaining?

In 2020 when the pandemic started, I was stuck at home with my parents. To keep our sanity, my parents started walking on our apartment's terrace, and I merely went to join them in an effort to destress from a toxic job. This resulted in a clear routine for most of 2020, with exercise in the morning and speed walking in the evening, and I reduced 15kgs successfully. The workout somehow instilled a diet discipline in me too, and I was able to avoid junk food and overeating, and had a proper carb-fiber-protein meal. 

And then, in January 2021, I married my boyfriend and moved to his house in a different city. Things have gone for a toss, as the change in environment, food habits, and routine severely affected my workout schedule. 

- For starters, my husband is a late sleeper and a late riser, and planning my sleep schedule around his has made me awfully lethargic. 
- We stay with his parents, so, in order to steal some 'us' time away from them, we resorted to frequenting cafes with not so many healthy options. In addition, the food is vastly different at my husband's place, that I don't get my fair share of veggies. 
- The whole change in routine hasn't allowed me to keep up my workout schedule. It's like, there was a big upset to my routine and I could never recover from it.

Welcome back to another week of weigh-in Wednesday. I was on the road last week and couldn't find time to host the thread. Sorry for that.

.Share your +/- change from last Wednesday to this Wednesday, and a short summary of your week. Sometimes we get lost in the day to day ups and downs and it's good to see our week over week changes. Time to celebrate losses and lift each other up during possible failures. This is not a timed event or contest, feel free to jump in any time.

That being said, I eat way too much sugar. I'm meaning like, I'm binging on sugary food. I would like to cut down a lot on sugar, but definitely not cut it out completely. 

Part of my problem is I never know what to eat, and sugar is quick and easy.  Does anyone else have this problem and have suggestions on how to fix it? I also have issues just knowing what to eat in general, so I often eat fast food and things like that. It is definitely hindering my weight loss, but I'm also worried about getting diabetes and high blood pressure (it runs on both sides of my family.)",1646181748.0
t4d9qy,People aren‚Äôt taught this stuff,Vent/Rant,21,0.75,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t4d9qy/people_arent_taught_this_stuff/,8,"When I was younger, all I was taught about nutrition/dieting is that you need to eat three meals a day and if you wanted to loose weight just exercise and eat more lettuce. 

That why I gained so much weight. No matter what I did on a certain day I ate three meals. And many days I still felt hungry. No matter how long I exercised, I couldn‚Äôt loose weight. I tried diets with salad but I was so hungry all the time. Until I started learning more about nutrition, I didn‚Äôt start loosing weight. The four  things I learned that helped me are:

1. You need to eat balance marcos (fats, carbs and protein)

I know many people have problem with the keto and carnivore diets but protein is scientifically proven to keep people satiated. I don‚Äôt think people need to go keto or carnivore but a diet without sufficient protein is setting your self up for failure. Most easily accessible food are calorie dense carbs but if you try to diet with that you will hold a bunch of water and feel hungry all the time. Also plain salad is not sustainable as a diet.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15466943/

2. You cannot out run your fork

A mile run burns 100 calories, a nature valley granola bar is 190 calories. Unless you are on a high school football team, you are not going burn enough calories. Losing weight is primarily going to be diet focused. Exercise helps but you don‚Äôt need to be a gym freak to loose weight.

https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/running-burn-calories-per-mile

3. It isn‚Äôt easy or linear.

Unlike some people think, this is not easy. It takes vast amounts of willpower and inner strength. You are literally going against human nature. Our bodies are also weird and unpredictable at times and hold weird amounts of water. Life also gets in the way. I don‚Äôt like telling my mother I can‚Äôt eat the food she worked hard to make. If you keep failing (you will) just get back on your diet. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, just go back on it.

4. CICO (calories in, calories out)

CICO works, however people say to make dieting sound easy. You need to burn more calories you than consume. Sound simple right, no. Determining how many calories a food item is like predicting the future. You are never completely right. This is even worse if you don‚Äôt personally cook the food. 

I think these things aren‚Äôt taught to the youth. Or maybe I just wasn‚Äôt in class that day. Stay strong guys. Also I am 35 pounds down",1646155752.0

We discussed examples of what I ate the last two days.

We discussed my goal (which is weight loss - associated with getting to a healthier BMI for health reasons).

I DID NOT jump on a scale - which part of me is relieved about and part of me is not relieved about. 

Here is what I'll be working on 1) Getting in one more serving of yogurt esp right before bed (when I typically get hungry). 2) Getting in a tbsp of olive oil (she was pro avocado oil but I am allergic) a day plus a serving of nuts. 3) Eat dark chocolate for my sweets. 4) Eat until I'm full and try to be mindful of that (this was probably my biggest and most problematic point to be honest). 5) Look into Flax (idk) 6) go to ellynsatterinstitute.org to look at how to help my kiddos make good choices

So part of me knows and understands that I am insanely stand off ish and that I almost always reject new people. It takes a long time before I accept others into my circle of trust - esp medical professionals. So please know that I'm a bit biased of a new person and am distrustful of this just outright. I know that about myself going in and I know to tell myself I'm going to work on all of this regardless of my feelings. Just a full on disclaimer. I might not like it or agree, but I'm going to do it.

All felt very basic and fine. Not jazzed about this ""eat until your feel full"" bullshit.

I've written it, then deleted it a few times, actually.  I see on here a lot of people struggle with unsupportive partners/family and it made me think people who are new to weight loss or anyone thinking of starting weight loss plan may wonder if it's commonplace to have such negativity follow them so why bother trying.  So I wanted to put it out there that not everyone you meet will be negative about your weight loss, but sometimes you have to ask for support outright.  So here's my story:

I've been with my boyfriend since 2018 (remember 2018, what a great time that was, so carefree we all were!) and I was about 202lbs when we met.  Fast forward to 2020 and I was up to 219 lbs.  I told myself (and him) that I was going to lose weight for about 2 years.  I think near the end he just saw it as ""here we go again.""  But the last time I said it I became serious that I was going to make efforts to lose weight.  And I have!  But not without it's struggles.  See my boyfriend is one of those naturally skinny people.  He can eat whatever he wants and never gain weight.  So he just doesn't understand the struggles. We'd watch My 600 Pound Life and he just couldn't understand these people at all.  I was struggling a little bit with him asking me to bring home fast food after work (he works from home), or he'd say ""let's have pizza for supper!"" and it would derail me completely because I can't control myself when I'm around foods like that.  Then one day we're watching My 600 Pound Life and a therapist is talking to a mother/daughter.  The daughter had the surgery but the mother was bringing home fast foods and eating it in front of her daughter and saying ""I'm not on a diet, she is.""  So the therapist had to tell the daughter to speak up and tell her mother to stop bringing those foods home because it was overwhelmingly tempting her.  That's when I turned to my boyfriend and told him the same thing.  ""Can you not ask me to bring home fast food to you?  You can order it in when I'm at work, that's fine, but if you could even hide the evidence so I'm completely unaware.  And please don't ask me to have fast food for supper with you.  If I choose to have a cheat day, I'll let you know, but I want them to be few and far between."" And he actually agreed and has been keeping up with this arrangement since November.  I think the show opened his eyes to a world he didn't understand and now he was able to sympathize with me better.  

I also exercise every night.  Our home isn't that big, so I work out in the TV room. My boyfriend smokes so when my alarm goes off at 7pm to tell me to exercise he'll go for a cigarette and I'll let him know when I'm done.  But in these freezing winter months he can't be out in the unheated garage for 30 - 40 minutes.  So what he does is goes for a cigarette at 7pm for 5 - 10 minutes while I warm up.  Then he comes inside and I give him my phone to set the timer.  My workouts are low impact interval training, so I need a timer set.  First workout is timed, he tells me when I'm at 1 minute, then 2 minute, which means I can wrap it up.  He stops the timer and says ""2 minutes, 20 seconds."" or whatever the timer reads.  Then I rest for 2 minutes.  Next round means I do the exact same routine but try to beat that time by 10 seconds.  2 minute rest. 3rd time I push myself as hard and fast as I possibly can to beat the second time.  He actually loves being my timer and gives me a lot of praise when I'm done and I've beaten my timer.  Then I do my floor work while he continues to watch TV.  This is our routine 5 nights a week.  

I'd love to hear other people's supportive stories.  I think we see so many negative stories on here that we forget not everyone is out to sabotage our efforts for success.  Those people do exist, so let's tell that story for a change.",1646137967.0
t3v81p,Bad meals don‚Äôt have to turn into bad days. Bad days don‚Äôt have to turn into bad weeks. Bad weeks don‚Äôt have to turn into bad months. Keep going!,,274,0.99,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3v81p/bad_meals_dont_have_to_turn_into_bad_days_bad/,12,"I used to be someone with that ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù mentality. I was either going to eat extremely healthy and exercise‚Ä¶or do nothing at all. And of course I was going to burn out like that!

Anyway. Gained 10+ lbs over my usual weight during this pandemic, became more sedentary, you know the story.

I started this year at 5‚Äô2‚Äù (157 cm) and 125 lbs (57 kg). This is a normal and healthy weight for many people! But for me, 110-115 lbs (50-52 kgs) is where my body is healthiest, and my cholesterol + glucose levels show it.

Luckily, this is all made easier by having a partner who is also getting healthier! We‚Äôre making lifestyle changes that are sustainable by prioritizing the simple exercise we like (long walks with our dog) and eating the right portions of food we enjoy. No force-feeding kale salads here, but he‚Äôll blend some frozen kale into his fruity smoothies. I snack on Screamin‚Äô Hot Veggie Straws almost every day, but I weigh out an actual serving size.

Most of all, I learned that a bad meal doesn‚Äôt mean I have to throw away the rest of the day. I can indulge and have too much spinach dip because a friend came over, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to finish the rest of the tortilla chips when she leaves. And that bad day doesn‚Äôt automatically mean I won‚Äôt be in a deficit for the week, and a bad week doesn‚Äôt even have to mean a bad month. It‚Äôs been so much easier to not drive myself crazy with guilt if I eat a little more in one meal because the bigger picture is more important.

I‚Äôve lost 9 lbs in 8 weeks like this, and I‚Äôve actually started eating my exercise calories back because I felt like I was losing too fast. I‚Äôm also putting on some water weight due to more exercise (Ring Fit Adventure is no joke if you use it right) and these sore muscles need to recover, but I‚Äôm not worried at all.

So at my gym there's this challenge, and since november I've been going roughly twice a week (but had to stop in december-january-february because of lockdown and we did online classes though honestly they didn't do much for me). As last week, I've been going 3 times a week and I will continue to do that for the forseeable future.

So for reference I am:

* Female
* 24
* 138lbs (63kg)
* 5ft 2in
* Body fat 40.8%
* Muscle mass 44lbs
* Bust/Waist/Hips (in inches) 38/29/39
* With a metabolic rate of 1410

And I obviously was disgusted. I always knew I was ""just in the overweight"" mark, but never considered myself to be actually obese in terms of body fat percentage.

What's infuritating is that I eat less than 2000 calories a day, I would say I average around 1500-1700. But I'm not going to cry about it, I want to **do** something about it.

My **entire family** has diabetes be it type1 or type2 (mostly type 2, but one or two members with type 1). The only people that don't have it are myself and my younger brother, every single adult is obviously obese, and my dad told me last week that he too was diagnosed with diabetes making literally every single immediate family member both related and unrelated have diabetes. And I've always done my best to not go down that path, problem is... looks like I was going about it the wrong way.

I should add that in 2019 I went on the nexplanon implant, and my weight went up from 120lbs to 140lbs in 4 weeks (giving me huge stretch marks), and I've been stuck around that 140lbs mark. But I'm determined to get back down. There is no way I cannot. It's maths, and now I have the numbers to work with. I'm determined. My mum said that she deveoped a comorbid thyroid disease along with her type 1 diabetes around my age. I'm just praying to anyone that will listen that I don't get that, so I hopefully won't also get any thyroid problems.

At the gym I struggle to lift the 15lbs, so I pick those.

As of today I've given up bread (just in time for lent, I'm not using pancake day as an excuse. Fuck excuses, I'm disgusted with myself) and I was thinking of going extremely low carb while counting my calories and keeping them at 1400 (I was thinking lower so that I have wriggle room as I don't know the exact calories of everythign I eat as I don't have scales)? And I've written bixby routines on my phone that will open up the calorie counter app at every meal time, along with custom notifications reminding me to not get bread every time I go within 150m of the supermarket... Maybe I'll write on that opens a page that reminds me of my body fat percentage before every meal time, or a photo of my body idk.

But clearly, I, who spent the entirity of my teenage years starving myself, is doing something very wrong to get to 40% body fat.

They're just a matter of a few grams and I'm not really bothered by it, I'm just concerned whether the other is more accurate or what.

I've been tracking my calories since the beginning of February and have lost 2kg, give or take. 

My first few weeks of tracking was probably inaccurate because I was using cups to measure my portions only to realize that the cup I was using and fitnesspal meant two completely different things. One cup of rice in fitness pal was like 158 g and I was using a cup that's like 250ml in volume, not to mention was packing it really tight lol (used for baking) lol so there was definitely a mismatch. ü•≤üòÖ

I'm weighing my foods now using a digital food scale. I don't strictly put everything in fitnesspal so I'm sure there's a little inaccuracy in the total amount of my calories each day, but since I started counting calories I found that it's easier for me to stay away from fast foods and junk foods, and sugary drinks, so that's a win for me. I'm also drinking a lot of water more than I used to.

More info, I started at 75KG, I'm a 5'3 21 y.o female, and I'm on 1200 cals daily (tho I don't tend to consume all of it), I don't get hungry that much anymore and has other things that keeps me occupied most times. 

Is 2kg weight loss for a month okay? Is it too slow? 

I started working out today. 21 mins of Fitness Blender video (cardio) that I found to be effective for me a few years back.

We also have a treadmill and stationary bike and actual bikes, would it be better for me to do any of those three activities rather than the Fitness Blender videos? My goal is to be at least 57-55kg, so I can have a normal BMI.

Edit: I used to be very skinny in my younger years, like 16-17 kg until I was maybe 9 y/o? Then started gaining weight and finally caught up with the ideal weight for my age and height. 75kg is my heaviest, mostly because of my lifestyle for the past three years, I'm an online student in a foreign country, doesn't really go out or what, so that's why üò¨",1646201862.0

t4rb6f,"Are Musashi Bars Any Good, Or Just Candy?",,0,0.5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t4rb6f/are_musashi_bars_any_good_or_just_candy/,3,"Hi all,

Not sure if this belongs here, but I guess I will see how I go.

About 6 months ago I reached the end of my weight loss journey - started at 140kg, now down (consistently) to 82kg.

Im now trying to transition my diet away from ""weight loss"" to ""muscle gain"" and im struggling to fill my diet with the requisite calories to do so. Every time I try and do a meal plan my lunch ends up looking like a metric fuckton of eggs and greens, and I know I wont stick with that.

So ive been looking into protein bars as an ""easy"" supplemental meal, and on paper the Musashi 60g bars look good:

* 250 cals
* approx. 10g Fat
* 2.5g sugar
* 4g carb
* 20g protein

But is this all a trap? I want to increase my lunchtime calorie count and eat more protein, but im worried the breakdown of the ingredients in these bars (and similar products) just equate to ""junk"" (and I dont have the knowledge to know any different).

Does anyone have any insight on these or protein bars in general? Are they just shit to put in your body to fill a hunger hole, or can they actually be ""good"" for you?",1646194227.0

AAAAAAAH, made for a great day. Later they asked how much I have lost & I told them 40 lbs. I told them I had 60 more to go & they were very wary, which is something I expected. 

It was really nice because I've had a few rough days of over eating recently.  This was a nice pick-me-up.

I would say that I am really noticing a difference now. I will stop & look at myself & the mirror & just think ""Wow, I look like a normal weight"".

I‚Äôve had a lot of success giving up non-food items in the past, but whenever I try to give up sweets, or a specific type of treat, it ultimately fuels the binge/restrict cycle. After 2 months of daily tracking in MFP, I‚Äôve noticed that my most binge-like moments are during my workday when something inevitably stresses me out. 

Would giving up daytime snacking make things worse? How are you all thinking about Lent in ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô ways?

I have been working on improving myself and losing much of the weight I have gained over the years.  Currently, my goal is to lose an additional 100 pounds (I've lost 20 so far).  I've been going back and forth on the scale with varying levels of success. 

But, I have noticed that sugar is my problem.  It is a horrible addiction to try and break.  I need a pick me up in the afternoon and tend to fight myself from grabbing sweets.  Yes, I have had some fruit but this does not satisfy the craving.  I'll eat a sensible meal and then this craving kicks in.  I can fight it sometimes, but other times it gets the best of me.

What have been some successful strategies that have worked for you in breaking this addiction?  I currently meal prep (this makes life so much easier) and  exercise as best as I can.  I also go to WW to stay accountable to myself. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1646174157.0

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

Hi! I have never posted anything like this but really hope my journey helps someone.  [This](https://imgur.com/a/nAKDhld) is my gradual progression from not being able to run for 2 min at a time to being a recreational athlete 

To disclaim, I've had problems with my body beginning in 2010/2011 when my best friend in middle school was 105lbs and 5'10 and I was 140lbs and 5'3ish so needless to say, I thought I was fat as shit (idiot). 

I was always big emotional eater and never considered how playing soccer and eventually quitting to work at a restaurant was burning a crap ton of calories between ages 12-19. 

When I got my first desk job, my eating habits only got worse, I started drinking and did not exercise. Cue 45lb weight gain over 1 year. Weirdest part was how I didn't realize how much my lifestyle was totally sedentary and how I was drinking at least 2000 cals of alcohol a week

I love food. I eat a lot of food. My goal was to get to a place where I could eat p much whatever and have a workout routine that sustained it. I realize now that's NOT possible entirely but you can certainly workout enough to justify massive quantities of food


Disclaimer: I did not eat breakfast this whole time, my calories came from lunch and dinner and SNACKS. I am 90% vegetarian, I do not eat red meat or pork. 


April 2020: 
‚Ä¢ Resisting advice of trainer, believes carbs are making me fat
‚Ä¢ started taking several 3 mile walks each week for exercise
‚Ä¢ consumed ""normal"" alcohol amounts (for the time period, this was 4-5x a week) 
‚Ä¢ (lost ~8lbs) 

May - June 2020: 
‚Ä¢ 4-5 walks each week
‚Ä¢ focus on eating ""healthy"" but struggling w/portion control 
‚Ä¢ Consumed much alcohol
‚Ä¢ (lost~2-3lbs) 

July - August 2020: 
‚Ä¢ Consistent 4-5 weekly walks
‚Ä¢ started drinking 32oz water before each meal and paying attention to calories
‚Ä¢ MUCH less drinking 
‚Ä¢ (lost ~10lbs)

September-Dec 2020: 
‚Ä¢ Zoloft and a puppy! 
‚Ä¢ Walks became daily (3 miles), puppy had me much more active. Eating didn't change

* Ended 2020 having lost 25lbs! You could only really tell in my midsection and hips.

November 2021: THIS is where the real change happened. 

‚Ä¢ 5-6 heated pilates/yoga/barre classes a week (45-60min)
‚Ä¢ 3-4 walks w pup each week
‚Ä¢ really struggled w my eating here - I was VERY hungry (not enough protein) but instead of realizing it was a lack of protein, I tried to be mindful of food quality rather than starving. 
‚Ä¢ Only period where I didn't intermittent fast. Slave 2 sugar 
‚Ä¢ (lost ~5lbs) 


January 2022: 
‚Ä¢ AM: 6 heated pilates/barre/yoga classes weekly. 
‚Ä¢ PM: 5-6x week walks w pup, 2-3 miles 

‚Ä¢ I just tried to eat less than 2000 cals a day and eat more protein. Slave to sugar. (Lost ~5lbs)

February 2022: 
‚Ä¢ AM: 6 heated pilates/barre/yoga classes weekly. 2 mile run 4-5x a week. 
‚Ä¢ PM: 5-6 weekly walks w pup, 2-3 miles 

‚Ä¢ I try to eat less than 2000 cals, cut out sugar and only drink 1x week. I drink Celcius daily (energy for the runs and I'm in sales so I need the juice lol) and I try hard to snack on fruits/veggies and high protein things (Lost 10lbs). 

I am suspicious the weight came off quicker due to the Celsius making me have more energy, but I also added nearly 2 hours of cardio to my routine. 

My takeaways? 

‚Ä¢ Do a little bit each day. 
‚Ä¢ DO NOT starve yourself. Find low calorie foods you enjoy to snack on 
‚Ä¢ Eat more protein 
‚Ä¢ Find workouts you genuinely love and feel empowered by 
‚Ä¢ Recognize this journey might not look like you expected!

[17 days out NSFW ](https://imgur.com/a/nSlqjZO) There is significant swelling and bloating. Normal but uncomfortable. Couldn't stand up straight.

[A few days ago] (https://imgur.com/a/xy49UMV) Significant reduction in swelling and bloating. I stopped wearing bandages a few weeks ago but continue to wear compression suit 24/7. Can almost stand straight up. 

Final results will show in about 6 months.


I will need additional procedures on my face and my pubic area in the future. That is less about function and more about vanity so it can wait. 



As soon as I'm cleared, I plan to start working out regularly and try to put on some muscle to improve my upper body appearance.


Overall, I'm pleased with the results thus far. It's not been particularly fun but the recovery has been steady and easier than I thought it would be.",1646046820.0

t46blf,So is this a plateau?,Question,11,0.8,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t46blf/so_is_this_a_plateau/,6,"Female, 5‚Äô6‚Äù SW: 270 CW: 199 GW: 150

So like a month ago I was excited to hit 199, but since then I‚Äôve kind of fluctuated between like 197 and 200. My goal weight is probably like 150 so I still have a ways to go.

I‚Äôve lost 70 pounds since September, it came out FAST AF. For majority of the time I did 1200 calories, and IF. I‚Äôm still doing IF because I do like it, but I‚Äôve been slowly increasing my calories.

I‚Äôm mainly increasing my calories because majority of my weight loss I didn‚Äôt work out. At the beginning of last month I started doing 30-40 minutes of actual exercise a day. I mostly do VR Supernatural and 2-3 Chloe Ting videos, usually a HIIT video and 2 muscle targeted ones.

I definitely feel the muscle building, so I thought we‚Äôll maybe it‚Äôs just my muscle building is countering the scale. 

But I started reading about how plateaus work, and I think maybe it‚Äôs just that? I haven‚Äôt been below 200 in almost 10 years and with the increased exercise with the calories deficient my body is finally just yelling ‚ÄúCAN YOU CHILL‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not really getting discouraged, because I kind of still ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the weight coming off, or maybe just feel more muscle.

I think my TDEE with moderate exercise is like 1900? So I mean, should I up my calories? I‚Äôve felt fine over the last few months. Usually I even do my workouts while fasted, (though my schedule changed and this isn‚Äôt the thing now)

I have changed things up a little bit over the last month. I had a bout of constipation so I increased my fiber intake, which veered from me doing minimal carbs. I eat a high fiber smoothie I make every day. I wouldn‚Äôt think the sugar in it isn‚Äôt sabotaging me? I add no juice or anything with added sugar to it.

If anything I feel like the smoothie and extra fruit I‚Äôve added to my diet has given my more energy so I enjoy it.

I also haven‚Äôt had any real REAL cheat days. The closest I had to one was on Thanksgiving and I ended up throwing that meal up because it was too rich lmao. So I don‚Äôt have any cravings for ‚Äúbad‚Äù food in high quantities.

I dunno, this is the most successful I‚Äôve been in losing weight ever, I‚Äôm just curious if my idea of plateau is right.

Thank you!",1646135946.0

When i started my weightloss journey in 2016 I was successful with just eating better and moving more. Nothing Crazy diet wise, just things like eat more vegetables and don't eat out. This did cause big issues in my social life as i was so strict with the not eating out. 

Every 12-18 months I've had blood tests done to ensure everything is ok, nothing was ever a concern.

Fast forward I've got up and down and back to reaching 110kg in 2022. I went to get a blood test and it's come back that my cholesterol is high. During my next Drs appointment they'd like to go over my whole health and discuss things more, which 100% for as I trust my GP a lot.

I've really struggled with motivation lately. Back in 2016 it was easy to get motivated to go to the gym a few times a week. But now I have more knowledge of the gym but can't get myself there. So I've focused more on food (as I know you can't out train a bad diet) but I'm also struggling there. I see a psychologist to assist with my mental health but I was wondering if the community felt I could benefit from seeing a dietician.

In 2017 I saw a nutritionist every 4-6 weeks and we'd do a body scan each time and each time she'd tell me I wasn't consuming enough protein as my muscle mass wasn't going up. It was really demotivating as I was trying so hard. My weight would be going down but as it was a mix of fat and muscle she'd make me feel like a failure.

Have you had an experience with a dietician? was it good? or bad?

Was my experience with that nutritionist the normal experience?

Is it worth the money?

Should I be seeking guidance elsewhere?",1646181242.0

If you have 2 minutes to read my story and lend me a helping hand I would really appreciate it... I think I just need a little push and I'm very lonely in this road.

I'm 39m 1.70m, 94 kg (or 5ft 7, 207 pounds for you crazy americans üòÑ)

Over the last 10 years I gained something like +40 pounds. I had an normal body before, with a little tendency to gain weight, but I always managed to shed some / most of it. But then after I hit my 30s came mental health issues + sedentarism + quitting smoking and I got a lot bigger. I don't really binge but during the years I gained weight I tended to overeat ""a little"" in general, ordered food, and was really stressed and depressed... basically wasn't taking good care of myself in any way. So little by little over a decade I gained 4 pounds a year. It doesn't sound or look like much as it happens, but then one day I found myself out of breath doing basic things.

After COVID hit I was at my heaviest and I was so scared I was gonna catch it and die that I became a recluse, gained some more weight. I was at my worst. Started doing IF 16:8, which kinda helped and then not so much, but it was my fault because I was breaking my fast inadvertently adding a splash of milk to my black coffee.

After I got my vaccine in 2021 I said enough is enough and went to the doctor. My BMI was something like 35 which is not \*that\* terrible per se, but my blood work was dangerous, prediabetes, colesterol, liver damage and all. Worst part, really severe a¬¥pnea (which I've been told is a consequence but may have been also one of the causes). So I started CPAP which did wonders for me, and I started medication and doing the work: went to a dietitian, who told me all the things I already know, but it's good to commit and be accountable with someone else. I still couldn't get myself to do sports but I started walking a lot (before I gained weight I used to practice ashtanga yoga, I was in good shape and felt good in my skin, but now I just can't get myself to do it, my muscles don't stretch and I have a bad wrist, I can't lift myself off the floor now, stuff like that, whenever I try to go back I just feel incredibly sad remembering my past body and what it could do and it kills me).

I managed to lose something like 8kg (15 ish pounds) but then I went through a rough patch in my life and I didn't feel like getting out of bed, let alone go to the grocery store, prepare salads, soups and all the good stuff. I started eating pastries every now and then, sandwiches, pizza... the portions are not that bad, but I should be eating that way less often. So even though I do 16:8 IF (and have no problem with it whatsoever)... I don't really lose weight anymore cause I'm clearly above my calorie limit, and eating processed foods and what not. I didn't gain weight but I didn't lose any. I was also keeping track of everything with the weight loss sheet in this subreddit so at the beginning my trend was winning, but now I'm way behind my goal... and am not keeping track of what I eat. I do weigh myself every day, and I am used to the normal oscillation, but I forget to track it sometimes.

I stopped going out for walks because of the depression, and because I get too much pain in my (flat) feet, I have yet to go to the doctor to see what's up with that. But I have wrist surgery coming on soon... so I get overwhelmed and I freeze. I also skipped one visit to the dietitian back in november (I guess I was avoiding accountability) and just abandoned it.

I guess the fact that I managed to mantain for 3 months, sleep and breathe properly, and correct all the terrible numbers in my blood work, all while wanting to not exist anymore... is a kind of victory?

So... what can I say. I know what I have to do... and how things are done. I have my meals, my plan, my tracking sheets... I just can't seem to go back to it. The ""what for?"" is winning me over. I want to fight, but I'm getting weaker.  I've read somewhere that this subreddit is one of the most positive encouraging places in the internet. So if you have some of that positive encouragement for me and would be so kind to share it with me, maybe it will make a difference...

Thank you.

TL;DR - I completed a third of my goal and got stuck (mentally and physically) after going through a series of bad events. Having a hard time continuing. Thankfully I managed to mantain for the last 3 months, but I'm scared I will gain the weight back if I don't go back to a more healthy and active lifestyle.",1646156308.0

Anyways, that night something clicked, I honestly don't know what it is but it's working. 

The next day I threw away all my junk food, sodas, & candy. I bought whole foods only.

I‚Äôve decided I want to lose weight. I‚Äôm a lazy 21yo working full time in an office my goal is to join the military (Australian Defence Force). Although i am under the max BMI levels to be eligible, my body fat is too high and i‚Äôm eager to start training. I want to become more fit and to be able to pass the PFA (personal fitness assessment) while building my confidence which has been deteriorating.

Does anybody have cardio exercises (jogging, running) tips i could follow? I‚Äôm planning on going to the park next to my house to start running laps, i‚Äôm just not sure for how long and how far. 

This is my first step to my goal. I know it‚Äôs going to be difficult, my main worry is thinking my motivation and discipline will act up, but the idea of joining the Military will be the thing that will keep me going. I‚Äôm excited to start this journey.

My question is... Is there really any problem with eating all that food at once if it's only 600 calories? I'm literally shocked at how much food it is, that should be healthy, can only be 600 calories... And I absolutely love the food in question.

I love her, and seeing her sad and hearing her talk about herself in a self-deprecating way is brutal.

Full disclosure. I used to be.... a terrible support for her on this subject. I grew up in a pretty old school Asian household, where I was told what to do, what to eat, who to be friends with, and basically constantly nagged (and sometimes screamed at) about my inadequacies. So during the first stint when she was starting to try and lose weight, I would subconsciously bring some of those habits down on her, which I now realize makes me the king of assholes. I can't change the past though, I can only try to be a better partner from this point on. 

Things I'm working on:

When she complains about her weight, I ask her if she wants advice or just support. Generally speaking if she doesn't actively ask me for advice, I won't dole it out, I will just try to support her in her healthy habits and try to cook food that is healthy but still tasty.

If she has negative self talk, I try to turn that talk around and tell her she's beautiful.

The issue is when she does ask for advice, I try to ask (in a non-confrontational, non-blaming way), and it always end up with her in tears. It's just a really emotional for her, and she's always had some self-esteem issues. It's possible that I just cannot be the person who gives her any advice on this seeing as I've been someone who's hurt her self-esteem before, I can only be here for support. But When I urge her to maybe talk to a trainer or a nutritionist, the conversation will still end in tears and a complete shutdown from her.

To sum it up, I‚Äôm not sure I can understand how it‚Äôs physically/scientifically/medically possible to be in the calorie deficit I‚Äôm in and not see any changes. I recently had a change to my medications (which is a laundry list in itself), and I‚Äôve just had zero appetite and been routinely sick to my stomach. My one long term medication I started is for ADHD, and it‚Äôs just slashed my appetite to zero. On top of that, I recently suffered an injury from a cat at work, so I‚Äôve been on antibiotics which make my stomach sad. 

Prior to the medication situation, I had already been cracking down hard for months on my weight. I cut out alcohol, only drinking on rare occasions like going out to eat. I made a lot of lifestyle changes and have been regularly attending yoga and going to the gym. My boyfriend has already lost about 15 pounds while putting on muscle, not that he needed to lose any because he‚Äôs got a very low BMI. He just wanted to be my gym buddy. 

My BMI is 32-33, which is just wild. I‚Äôm going into week 4 of barely being able to get maybe 500 calories in myself per day, and that‚Äôs force-feeding. Even that is healthy stuff like Greek yogurt, frozen fruit bars and low glycemic protein bars. My BMR is calculated out to be about 1,500 calories/day. My job is very physical, and I‚Äôm also active outside work and my excessive (I hike long distances). My Apple Watch puts me at 600-1,500 active calories on a good day, and about 300-500 on a slower day. 

I have lost no weight at all . I have gained no muscle. I am extremely frustrated. My boyfriend is highly concerned because he thinks there‚Äôs something terribly wrong with my health. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Has anyone experienced such a thing?",1646159014.0

Since we were little, my mum always obsessed over food and controlled what we could and couldn't eat. This resulted in both of us being overweight as teenagers. Over the years, I have managed to put things in perspective, heal the trauma and lose weight, so I'm ""normative"" nowadays. I have also openly talked about this with my mum, who has admitted her wrong doing during our childhood and has apologized multiple times. What's better, she has completely changed her attitude. 

However, my sister has developed an increasingly obesity over the years. This led her to be emotionally unavailable, hasn't ever opened, not even admitted her struggles with her self image or her self esteem. She told me once ""If I never say it, people will never know, and someday I'll be thin and people will be shocked and all my problems will be over"". These are fairytales no woman of 27 years of age should seriously believe. 

I am a very social and outgoing person and I have always had lots of friends. Some years ago, my sister started going out with me and my friends and overtime her social life became dependant of me. I have always had a great relationship with my sister and we get along really well, but I also need my personal space and social life out of my family, specially when she tends to judge a lot.

She obviously has some mental struggles and almost no love for herself. However, if you try to bring up the subject, she will deny it, get angry and won't talk to you for as long as she's upset. Then, she will talk to you after a few days of complete silence (while you have been overthinking and feeling shit for making her upset when she needs help) and expect you to treat her as always, as if anything happened. Believe me, I have tried multiple psychological techniques to initiate the conversation, none of them work.

I think she tends to compare herself with me all the time and just my presence makes her feel like shit or inferior somehow. Also, she has never had a boyfriend or a hookup, so when I talk about my love life in front of her and my friends she always has some mean comments - from her point of view, all of the guys I intimate with are predators and dickheads.

Also, I would like to add that she has a pretty intense online role playing life she obviously will never ever admit having. I know she has had boyfriends and multiple friends from role-playing but she has never shared that with me. What's funny, if something happens in my life and she doesn't hear first, she gets mad with me and says I don't trust her anymore.

I'm so fed up of this situation. I know she needs help and I feel like I'm the only one that can do something. I don't want her to spend the entirety of her life obsessing over weight and feeling like shit all the time. I just don't know what to do, I don't know how I can help. This whole situation, after all these years, is starting to weaken me internally to the point I don't really like spending time with her anymore.

Over the course of about 15 months, I went from about 290 to around 202.  And I was feeling pretty satisfied with myself about that.  People complimented me, I was getting attention from the desired gender, I was able to find clothes at the store that fit me without digging through racks of clothes.  It was actually... kind of awesome.

But it didn't make me happier.  I still felt like the odd one out, my relationship of the time didn't improve, something still was missing in my head.  I knew I'd wind up gaining all the weight back.  I was right about that - over the course of the following 15 years, it came back.

Just a bit of backstory - I had major success losing 35 pounds last year using CICO at home. However, I moved into college last September and since then it's been a struggle. I have gained back most of the weight and numbers aside, I'm feeling sluggish all the time. 

Currently, my school requires us to buy a meal plan when living on campus freshman year. The food offered here is mostly fried, high calorie, and heavily processed. As someone with celiac disease, this is even harder. My options are limited. I we have a salad and rice bowl bar that's great, as well as a sushi place, but outside these two my options for whole meals are burgers, pasta, and starbucks. I can make these work some days, but I don't always want to spend my days eating around a 1,000 calorie dinner.

I have been able to get to a grocery store or target about every week or so to buy healthy snacks, but I have limited fridge space. 
 
Unlike my last bout with CICO, I am aiming to eat within a calorie amount that will allow me a 1/2-1 pound instead of the 1-2 pounds I was working on last year. I am hopeful this will be a little more stable and easier to maintain in school. However, I wanted to see what your suggestions were to help me stay on track in the dorm.

Basically, I'm 6'4 (M22) and I have about 100 lb to lose (currently just over 330, my goal is 230 lb, is that even a good weight for a man my height?) - I pretty much ballooned over the past few years (though I've always been a chubby kid)

I started at 370 last October and through diet alone I reached 330 by the end of 2021. I didn't really do much exercise during this period, this was all just change in my diet.

Then I went back to my old ways for a month and half and went back up to 350 in mid February 2022.

On 18th February something really upset me due to my appearance so I was more motivated than ever to lose the weight. Since 18th Feb, I have been walking approx. 4 miles every morning in a fasted state as soon as I wake up (though I drink water before I walk),  and I go to the gym after 7pm. Can't really change the timing of that. I've taken the odd day off from the gym because my muscles were sore so not exactly *every day*.

I also eat two times a day: I have cheerios (the plain one) in the morning straight away after my walk and dinner (usually chicken salan with 2 flatbreads) at around 3pm. I don't eat after 5pm. I'm thinking of having just grapefruit for lunch at 12pm.

At the gym I start off with 5 min on the treadmill to warmup, then I do all the upper body weight machines, 4 sets and at least 13 reps. Still not sure exactly how many reps or the weight I should be doing but I make it enough to make it a challenge. Then I do about 15 min in total on 3/4 cardio machines. I heard it's best to do muscle training first then cardio.

I don't do any leg workouts at the gym because I think I already have quite strong legs due to me being overweight for so long. But at the same time I don't want the skin on my thighs/swimsuit area to sag as I lose more weight? So idk what I should do there.

I have noticed that since I started going to the gym and doing muscle training my stomach has reduced in size quite a bit even though it's only been like 12 days. Am I making a mistake by not doing leg workouts? I'd like to have the v body shape so I don't want to make my bottom/waist any more thiccer. I'm now reaching 330 lb (from 344) since I started this lifestyle.

What do you think of my routine, what changes should I make? Is my weight goal appropriate? Am I right about not doing leg workouts?

My results are pretty dismal.  I am overweight with my BMI but my body fat puts me at obese.  I also have a muscle mass percentage of 26.2 and I'm only 40.  I was hospitalized about a year ago and lost a bunch of weight I suspect was mostly muscle.  My appetite increased and I ate more but obviously it went to fat stores instead of rebuilding muscle. It's disappointing but also inspiring.  I have started a combination strength and fitness routine along with tracking my calories and macros.  I know I got this.  My first goal is to stop being obese. Next goal is to get a muscle mass percentage of an average 50-60 year old.  Eventually I'd love to get to average fat and muscle tone for my age but I've got to start somewhere.,1646153642.0

Coming out of lockdown, I had lost almost 10kg, and everyone who saw me noticed it and congratulated me (and I mean EVERYONE). I've never sought attention for my weight loss, but it's nice when my efforts are acknowledged.

One evening, my friend and her mum came to my house for a socially distanced visit. My friend was seeing me for the first time in a year, but her mum had already seen me and was one of the people who complimented me. My friend's mum excitedly said to my friend ""look at how much weight she's \[me\] lost"", to which my friend quickly said, ""I don't see a difference""(the speed of her response felt weird). Since then, I haven't been able to determine if she said that to ""knock me down a peg"" or if she said it innocently.

Argument for her saying it innocently:

* She wasn't standing right in front of me
* She was outside in the dark while I was in my doorway, so I may have been backlit 
* She may have genuinely not registered a difference in my appearance 

Argument for her being malicious:

* She used to bully me; in particular, she would insult me and make intentionally hurtful comments
* She's shown in the past that she thinks that I think I'm better than her (probably one of the reasons she's been mean to me)
* We grew up together and were both severely harassed by our family unit for being overweight; she used to weigh less than me, but I think I'm the lighter one now (I say 'think' because I'm significantly taller than her, so I could look lighter while weighing more than her) 
* She is still very overweight, and her parents give her hell about it
* Our family unit considers me the golden child (I did better in school, I never argued back, I didn't talk to boys, etc.) Her parents have compared her to me our entire lives, and my weight loss is another thing they'd hold over her 

I don't want to think the worst of my friend, but given what I know about her, and given my personal experiences with her, I can't deny that she could've been trying to make me feel bad. I could also be overthinking this whole thing.",1646163679.0

March 2020 just as the Pandemic was declared, but before the lock down was ordered where I live my wife became symptomatic with Covid. I'd been ignoring very minor symptoms (headache/sore throat) because guidance at the time said they weren't.

She got better, she got worse, then she stayed worse. We were both heavy, and fairly young, she was 30, I was 33. This disease for old people put her on her back for 6 weeks with a few 'should we call an ambulance' moments. At the same time work fell apart (I work in aerospace) so I dove face first into fitness and weight loss.

We got a water rower and I would religiously do 30 minutes on it every day, sweat through my shirt. I also went on a pretty extreme diet/fasting plan. I wouldn't recommend what I did as generalizable so I'm inclined to avoid too much detail.

I dropped maybe 5-6lbs before I started dieting, the typical weight reduction you expect from exercise alone, and starting in late June I started dropping 3.8lbs a week like clockwork. By January I had lost 100lbs.

Turned my focus to maintenance for a year, slowly weight crept on due to strength training and general lack of precision in my dieting (I was monitoring, my rule was once I started being above 220 with consistency I'd do a cut down, I got there right around Christmas so I waited till after New Years for obvious reasons.

I switched to a more conventional diet model, started tracking, eating normal meal times, pulled my calories down and have slowly moved to maintenance.

[Not perfect but you can see the slight regain in the right.](https://imgur.com/a/R4pvp5i)

**What I've learned:**

* For someone who's always been heavy you might need vigilance always. Don't just jump back to 'normal' structure maintenance. 
   * Remember everyone's getting fat, so it's not like you're missing out on a mysterious ability to just 'do whatever' and not get fat. That thought used to torture me, but especially this past two years has shown that almost no one can just 'do whatever' without gaining weight.
* It helps to be working towards something fitness-wise. Not always be losing weight, but have something to orient your physical and dietary activities towards. I'm ending a weight loss cycle and will turn my focus more to strength development.
* Loose skin sucks and fucks with your head
* I didn't know what I was capable of, both in terms of rapid weight loss and maintenance but physical capacity. Go back two years and tell me I'd run 6 miles one morning just to see if I could and I'd assume you were high. I'm a big framed asthmatic, even if I lost weight that'd be awful.
* Embrace the difficult. Is it harder to make tasty meals without throwing sugar and fat in them? Yes, can it be done? also yes.
* Pain in exercise is inevitable, right now my right trap hurts, a couple weeks ago I pulled something dead lifting, and now when I rack my squats it can trigger. So I'm going to train around it, avoid heavy squats and deadlifts, perhaps do something different until I'm desensitized to the pressure. My non-exercising friends are also in pain, their backs hurt, hips, knees etc. Pain is unescapable, and the pain of fitness hurts less than the pain of ill health.

This is not meant to be self pity thread, but a little accountability post for myself and a message to people who haven‚Äôt really started their journey to a healthy body.
10 years ago, I was in the best shape of my life. I went from 250 to 160, from hard dieting and self discipline. But things started to go down hill when I tried new diets to cut more weight. 

What went from restricting meals (omad) to constant binge eating when I can. Looking back, I deeply regretted getting into that habit, and deeply regretted listening to ‚Äúadvice‚Äù from other people. Not saying OMAD doesn‚Äôt work, but it doesn‚Äôt work for me.

Flash forward to 10 years later, my binge eating habits has held strong, made even more strong by my body not being as used to exercise anymore. And being this overweight, it warps your mind into many terrible things. Promising yourself to change tomorrow, always tomorrow. Never today. Just one more cheat meal, and then you‚Äôll start living right. 

Well unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve been stuck in that loop of one more time for 10 years, and I realized these self destructive habits will lead to either a short life or a miserable one. 

Yesterday I weighed myself for the first time in months, and the number is not a pretty one. But it‚Äôs not depressing oddly enough. It was a spark to a fire long ago extinguished by a shitty life style and poor decisions. 

I renewed my gym membership yesterday, meal prepped for a week, bought fruits and vegetables, and calculated the optimal nutrition and calories needed to lose 2-3 pounds a week. I should be back to my prime before my 32nd birthday, which is roughly in 1 year.

She grew up in a family obsessed with diets and weight loss and has been monitoring her food intake ever since which then morphed into a daunting eating disorder.

We have known each other for years. She was relatively thin a few years ago (but never perceived herself as such) but following an abusive relationship, her weight fluctuated a lot. She first lost a lot of weight in just a few months following a dangerous diet where she would only eat a few fruits a day. That was obviously not sustainable and, as the relationship became more and more toxic, she started binge eating and gained a lot of weight.

She since broke up with her ex-partner and we got together 2 years ago. She‚Äôs in a much better place mentally and we both have a healthy relationship with food (we are not 100 % perfect but who is?) but she never managed to lose the weight and I feel that she has reached a breaking point and I don‚Äôt know how to help her.

&#x200B;

As a quick aside, I have always been skinny and have been able to eat pretty much everything I wanted without any weight gain. My family is the same and weight management was never a topic we discussed or even thought about as a family.

My parent will come visit us by plane this summer and she told me that she‚Äôs terrified of meeting them and that she dreads eating with them by fear of being judged. My parents naturally eat small portions, and she feels that she needs to match their portions at all costs.

Shopping for clothes is a traumatic experience for her and she always breaks into tears multiple times in the fitting room. We shop at an inclusive retail chain but even then, it is a struggle for her to find clothing that fit AND please her.

She told me that it doesn‚Äôt even feel like her body anymore. She hides her body constantly and hates the clothes she must wear in order to do so.

She hates that in order to lose weight, she will need to live her life counting calories, restricting herself and toying the line with her eating disorder. It feels very unjust. And it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs eating badly. Take out is once a week at most, she does not drink soda or junk food outside of that 1 take out and we cook balanced meals every day.

Since I‚Äôm skinny, she feels like she has to copy my food decisions because ‚Äòshe must not eat more than her skinny boyfriend.‚Äô (Her words)

She‚Äôs a fierce feminist and advocate for the body neutrality movement, but it is still very hard for her. She‚Äôs aware of the irony, but she‚Äôs extremely frustrated by the situation and started talking about more harmful ways to lose the weight (diet pills for ex.) and using harsh metaphors (like fantasizing about chopping off the fat with a knife). I don‚Äôt believe she will harm herself (we talked about it at length, and we see a professional already) but it is a glimpse into her distress.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm coming to this subreddit in search of advice. The truth is that 1) having never struggled with weight loss and 2) being a man, I lack the tools and experience to truly relate and help her.

I told her that I found her beautiful as she is, that I‚Äôm proud to introducer her to my parents and participate financially when she buys new clothes to avoid her feeling overwhelmed.

I really want to help her, but I don‚Äôt know how to and feel powerless. Knowing she‚Äôs in tears every time she‚Äôs in the fitting room, or that meeting my parents will likely trigger some very dark thoughts, I can‚Äôt help but try searching for a solution. But I am also aware that there is no easy solution, and that this problem has roots so deep that I can‚Äôt solve it by myself. My attempts at helping only scratch the surface of the issue.

t3ginb,Disappointed to be obese on my wedding day...,,38,0.9,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3ginb/disappointed_to_be_obese_on_my_wedding_day/,21,"I'm getting married in three days. I'm 5'6 (168 cm) and I weigh, I believe, something like 205 lbs (93 kg). That would mean that I have a BMI of 33.1, which makes me obese. I am so excited to be getting married to the love of my life, but I am deeply disappointed in myself for letting myself get into this condition and having to start this new, thrilling chapter of my life as such an unhealthy person. 

Once upon a time, I was a competitive (collegiate) ballroom dancer who weighed \~130 lbs (59 kg), BMI of 21. I didn't get there in a healthy way (I had some pretty disordered eating habits) and at the time I didn't appreciate the body that I had. Looking back on pictures from that time though, I can't believe that I ever looked like that. My body looked great, even if I couldn't see it at the time. 

Since then, I have kicked the worst of the disordered eating habits, but I have still been yoyo dieting ever since. At the beginning of the pandemic, I made some real headway, getting back down to around 150 lbs through a lot of exercise and CICO. Then I started grad school and everything went all to hell. Since August 2019, I have made absolutely no progress. There was one period early in 2021 when I lost about 15 lbs, but since then I have gained it all back and then some. I am so frustrated, and now I have to get married as an obese person.

So here's the plan: my soon-to-be-husband and I are going to have some kind of vow renewal ceremony next spring where we can have a larger celebration of our marriage because the wedding later this week is literally only going to include us and our parents. The tentative date for this is April 22, 2023. My hope is that by then I will be in terrific shape, oozing confidence, and wearing a dress that I absolutely love and feel amazing in. I know that I like how I look at around 130 lbs (particularly if I can get a bit more toned this time), so that's my goal. That means I have 419 days to lose approximately 80 lbs. That's 0.19 lbs per day, or 1.33 lbs per week. 80 lbs is a lot, but put in those terms, I think I can handle it. 

I'm posting about this because I really need to be held accountable. My plan is to use reddit to essentially keep a weight loss diary, writing a post (probably just on my own page) once a week about how things are going, how I'm feeling, what's going well, and what I could improve upon. I also intend to take regular progress pictures (maybe every 4 weeks? Every 10 lbs? Any suggestions would be appreciated.) I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, if I focus on establishing healthy habits rather than single-mindedly restricting calories, and if I feel like there are some people out there who care a little bit about whether I succeed or fail, that this time the weight loss will stick and I can finally become the fit, healthy person that I've been wanting to be for as long as I can remember.",1646057533.0

Jeeeeeeez. Put on more weight than I‚Äôd realised. Said, probably, most people in the last 6 months.

Have just committed to this weight loss journey and I have a question (below)‚Ä¶ but first, my story in a nutshell, for context (and in case it inspires anyone in a similar position):

As the title says, I‚Äôm a guy who somehow is now in his mid-40s. How did that happen? 6‚Äô5‚Äù‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve always liked to think of myself as relatively fit and healthy, as I used to do plenty of physical activities every week, but the pandemic put an end to most (or, all) of them, soooo‚Ä¶ here we are. Weighed myself about 10 days ago and was quite upset. 115kgs - when I used to be a lot closer to 100. Also attempted to take a pic of myself. That didn‚Äôt go well. Gave me the kick I needed to find you guys!

I‚Äôve already taken steps to get back to healthy activities - screw you, pandemic! - I‚Äôm playing tennis every week (as well as golf which I already play regularly, going to the driving range every week over winter). 

But that alone isn‚Äôt enough, I realised. So I downloaded the LoseIt app and told it to take my money. Set my ‚Äònot overly aggresive‚Äô target as 99.9kgs which it said would be about 15 weeks (I‚Äôm not overthinking this right now, and I‚Äôm happy to do this sustainably, i.e. 1kg/week or so). 

So a week ago I started tracking calories. I thought this was going to be a REAL pain‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really not!

https://i.imgur.com/mB3d0lb.jpg

I just completed my first week, and I‚Äôm already down 0.9kg!

My first question, for anyone who might know: is there a list of ‚Äòleast calorific to most calorific, by weight‚Äô foods somewhere, as an easy reference/inspiration for ‚Äúoh, I could add that to my meal planning!‚Äù? I realise I need inspiration, and variety, or I‚Äôll get bored and lose willpower. I just started scanning r/volumeeating and am already getting some ideas, but a big list somewhere would be great, if it exists?

I noticed, for example (since I started looking at and actually READING labels on foods) that orzo is half the calories by weight vs other pasta!? What‚Äôs that about? So I had that for lunch today and will have it again as it satisfies my pasta cravings and is half the calories. Yes please.

Are there any other great examples of less-calorific options that I can browse for inspiration?

Thanks for reading and I hope your journey is going well too!",1646077246.0
t3fozt,Does anyone else find that they start waking up in the middle of the night when they are losing weight?,Question,33,0.89,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3fozt/does_anyone_else_find_that_they_start_waking_up/,17,"Over the past three years I have had 3 periods where I've been eating heathy, exercising and consistently losing weight. All 3 times I have had the exact same problem - as soon as I start losing, I enter this weird phase where I can't sleep for more than 4 hours at a time. Does this happen to anyone else?

My normal sleep pattern when I am not losing weight is to go to bed around 11pm and wake up at 6:30am.

But every time I start losing weight it's the same pattern: by 10pm I am exhausted. If I go to bed at 10pm then by 2-230am I am wide awake. So normally I force myself to stay up till 11:30pm-ish and then by 4-430am I am wide awake. I have enough energy to go clean the apartment or work on my homework (went back to uni) or work work, but I don't because I don't want to wake my husband up. If I lie there I can normally fall asleep again around 5:30am.

I exercise in the morning, so I don't think it's caused by exercising too close to bedtime. My evening eating times are consistent whether I am in a period of losing, maintaining or gaining. And this time I have completely given up caffeine (for non weight loss related reasons).

Maybe it's somehow related to whatever body processes breakdown fat to use for energy? I have no idea, but it drives me crazy. I just want to sleep 7-8 hrs again.

Has anyone else been notice this happen to them when they lose weight?",1646055146.0
t3wqly,Could sleep apnea be keeping me fat? How do I resolve this? I need to lose weight before I end up diabetic.,,2,0.56,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3wqly/could_sleep_apnea_be_keeping_me_fat_how_do_i/,14,"I'm trying to lose weight. 27, Male, 5 foot 8 inches, 335.
I've struggled my whole life with weight. Sorry for the really long read but I'm trying to provide as much info as possible.

I was starting to really get down to a healthy weight, feeling better, sleeping better, when I was about 22. And it seemed like the more weight I lost, the quicker the rest would begin shedding. Then at 23 I got hurt at my warehouse job and went from 200 pounds (a fair amount of it muscle as I did slate roofing before this) to 417. 

I'm slowly recovering from that. Undoing many of the bad habits that came from my back basically not working and being partially immobile for 3/4 of a year helped me get back ware I am now. 

What occurs to me is I had sleep apnea as a little kid. But I had an alcoholic mother who didn't care to minotor it after my tonsils came out. And I was so young I grew up afterwards not really knowing what it was or caring. I'm far from a sedentary individual now but was a lot of my childhood because having losers for parents meant them losing a lot of jobs and us having to move around a lot, and me never really developing real social skills as a result of not being able to make and keep any friends and ending up just sitting in my house gaining weight because I didn't know anybody in the new neighborhood I was in that month. 

Now, One that thing is the same now as it was all through my life is that no matter how soon I go to bed, I seem to always wake up feeling either exhausted or meh and getting midday fatigue. Brain fog and forgetting things tends to be an issue. All my life All through school I've dealt with this. I've been tested for thyroid and all kinds of cancers and whacky stuff... thank CHRIST I'm not diabetic yet (according to all tests so far). I don't eat mega shitload portions. I cut chips and soda all out of my life completely. Chicken and fresh veggies are God. 

So far all blood tests have shown nothing really out of whack that would be CAUSING my weight. But...
I've realized that I haven't been able to sleep on my back at all in any 5 years so I beg the question.

Could I have sleep apnea and could it be causing me to not be able to shed all this tub on me? Even cutting calories (down to about 1,700 daily recommended by my doc for my current bmi) and walking 45 minutes a night for months has barely helped. The hunger cravings i get aren't normal. The moodiness and fatigue isn't normal. Getting a pounding headache because all you can think about is food isn't normal. I don't know what to do. I can't stand looking and feeling like this anymore. My doctor suggested I may very well have sleep apnea and the elevated cortisol levels it causes could be keeping me like I am. I wasn't loosing to pay on my deductible that's higher than Whiz f****** Khalifa, but should I go ahead and get a sleep study scheduled? I'm tired of looking and feeling this way.",1646101255.0

t2rzqb,Can we as a weight loss community normalize not NEEDING to give up anything in particular in order to lose weight?? (rant),Vent/Rant,1296,0.87,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t2rzqb/can_we_as_a_weight_loss_community_normalize_not/,147,"Disclaimer: the keyword here is **need.** If you want/like/choose to give something up to follow a particular diet that works for you or have consulted with a medical professional who told you that you do need to give something up, then this doesn‚Äôt apply to you! More power to you!

But I see so many posts on here of people saying they can‚Äôt seem to give up \* insert specific food or drink \* no matter how hard they try and oftentimes these same people are talking about how sad/depressed they are to have to give up this thing. Guys, I know the whole ‚Äúeverything in moderation‚Äù phrase is so played out, but the only circumstances I can think of where you *need* to give something up are

1. if it is medically or psychologically life threatening (I.e. gluten for Celiacs, alcohol for alcoholism)
2. you absolutely cannot control consuming something in excess (I.e eating 1 piece of chocolate will lead to you eating 3 bars in 1 sitting) although arguably you can overcome this with a healthy food mindset, but be aware of your current limitations

Other than that, the only things you really need to give up when it comes to eating in order to lose weight are a calorie surplus and a toxic relationship with food.

If I‚Äôve learned anything in my many weight loss failures and successes, it‚Äôs that you need to **LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!!** Don‚Äôt subscribe to a false sense of ‚Äúperfect health‚Äù and force yourself to do something in particular in order to be healthy. OVER RESTRICTION IS NOT HEALTHY!

If you have tried hundreds of times to give up bread and you can‚Äôt seem to do so, then maybe your body really loves and needs bread on occasion. Get some Ezekiel toast to boost your protein and eat bread to your heart‚Äôs desire. Or, factor in some sourdough into your day once a week so you can get your fix (pro tip: freeze the bread! Still tastes the same defrosted and you don‚Äôt have to worry about it getting old before you eat it all)

It‚Äôs not worth the guilty episodes of beating yourself up and ruining all your progress, triggering a binge episode of eating an entire baguette simply because you‚Äôve adopted an all or nothing ‚Äúeither I eat this excessively or I never ever eat this at all‚Äù mentality.

Substitutes exist. Portion control exists. If you love your morning coffee and can‚Äôt stand to drink it black or let it go, you don‚Äôt have to. Zero calorie syrups and milk can still help you meet your goal. Love rice and cauliflower rice isn‚Äôt doing the trick? Mix half rice half cauliflower rice or ditch the cauliflower all together and use RightRice or just eat a quarter cup of the white rice with a higher portion of protein so you‚Äôre still full. Yes, nutritional breakdown can impact fullness and is important but there are so many ways to get creative and enjoy eating.

Building an unhealthy relationship with food is only going to stunt your progress. There is no one size fits all approach for weight loss that works for everyone, even if it works for others. Some people need to cut out things in order for their progress to be maintained, for others cutting things out is not sustainable. Some people love substitutes, some hate them. Figure out who you are.

So long as you‚Äôre in a calorie deficit, feel good, and don‚Äôt have any underlying conditions, you can achieve your goals. Just hold yourself accountable to meeting a calorie/proportion/fat loss (or whatever else your measurement method is) goal. That‚Äôs all.

And remember, weight loss is hard, but eating should NOT be miserable!!

TL;DR: be nice to yourself and don‚Äôt make things worse for yourself trying to shove yourself into a mold of what you think healthy eating should look like. Be mindful, try different things, and see what works for you :)

Happy losing!

Edit: this was more of a PSA post to new users who want to lose weight to show them there are options outside of what seems ""most typical"" to avoid the all or nothing, black and white mentality. I'm also not advocating for or against any method- do whatever works, but don't be afraid to try different methods. ",1645979774.0

I did some research on protein powders recently and tried isopure - which has no taste - but it changed the textures of things I put it in. I thought it would be no big deal, but when I try the smoothie or makeshift ice cream or whatever, my immediate response is to gag. I don‚Äôt know why?? It doesn‚Äôt smell bad and the change in texture is minor. I also tried the Premier Protein drinks and got the same response - an immediate and intense gag.

I weighed 97kg (213lbs) now I'm only 68kg (149lbs). I'm 5'11 and 25 year old male.  I don't really want to lose anymore weight but I think I still am as I'm probably eating under maintenance. I wouldn't mind cutting fat but probably shouldn't go too much lower.

I didn't have a proper strategy for the weight loss, I worked out a lot at the beginning but not so much now apart from runs a couple times a week. All I did was drastically cut down my food intake and start drinking a lot of energy drinks. My food isn't particularly healthy. For example yesterday I ate one microwave lasagne (630 cal), 3 bananas (280cal) two crackers with a bit of cheese (180), one yoghurt (70cal) and then 5 sugar free energy drinks.

Sometimes I eat more but as you can see i'ts around 1150 calories which I don't think is really enough especially as its not the healthiest. i struggle to eat more I have a bit of a problem with the energy drinks. I crave them so bad and my caffeine tolerance is quite crazy.

I'm a semi pro poker player mostly online, which means I spend a lot of time sitting, I can't cook food while I'm playing so it has to be instant as I can only cook food in the 5 minute tournament breaks. When I'm hungry I try to eat the minimum possible to satisfy it and I hardly ever order food like I used to. I don't deliberately under eat I just try not to think about food and the caffeine makes me less hungry.

The worst thing is that when I try to dedicate myself to a healthy lifestyle I end up thinking about food way too much and I end up eating too much. I eat less when I stop thinking about food all the time and use energy drinks to get rid of hunger. Also I can get obsessive with things like that and I want to focus my energy on improving my game not trying to eat super clean.

My life has improved a lot since losing weight and I would hate to gain it again but I do think I need to be a bit healthier.. any advice?",1646107612.0

Meal Prep Sunday is *the worst* to me because I hate the monotony of eating the same dish over and over again.  (That said, I know others not having to make decisions since their food is already cooked, so if that's you, great!  I'm happy you found something that worked for you, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that way if you prefer it.)

Lately I've replaced Meal Prep Sunday with Menu Plan Sunday.  I write out a list of things I'd like to eat, use that to help build the grocery list, and then go shopping for it all. I might pre-prep a few things (wash the grapes, wash and cut the celery, etc) but most of the meals will be cooked fresh throughout the week.

Spelling out what I intend to make each day of the week has some of the same benefits of ""not having to make decisions"" that the meal prepping does, but without eating the same meal over and over again.

Some caveats:  42F, SW: 279 CW: 179.   This is a target 1300 calories on a high protein CICO which is why there's not a whole lot of carb going on here outside of the fruits and vegetables. Lunch the next day is almost always the leftovers from the night before.

Here's today's menu, as an example:

* Breakfast: Coffee with light cream, salsa scrambled eggs with tomato and bell pepper, grapes
* Lunch: Grilled salmon with California vegetables, beans, pineapple
* Snack:  Green tea, celery and carrot sticks, whole wheat toast with peanut butter
* Dinner: Ground turkey meatballs, salad with ACV strawberry vinaigrette, steamed broccoli in butter sauce,  chocolate squares
* Before bed: Yogurt with blueberries",1646060132.0

First let me say I love this subreddit - you guys are the perfect blend of supportive and motivating. 

I am a M, 33, and I am recently separated from my partner. It was hard on me and I figured it was as good as any time to have that wake up call hit. So I started to really address some of my underlying conditions. Two of the biggest ones are my ADD, and obesity. 

I tip the scales around 350 pounds in Oct and at 6‚Äô1 that makes me quite large. It‚Äôs not healthy. So I am actively working on changing my relationship with food, limiting bad habits and correcting them, and establishing healthy routines. Around November I was officially diagnosed with ADD from a health professional and I was prescribed (generic) adderall. At first, only change I felt was I had more sustained energy but I was still snacking, binge eating, and my vices were still in rotation (thanks peanut butter M&Ms!). 

I‚Äôm not sure what changed but in Jan my body started to feel less needy. I no longer was susceptible to the marketing in the check out lane - I could easily turn down sweets. Then, as I started to track my calories with LoseIt, I saw my graphs change dramatically. I was struggling to come in under my calorie target (~2400/day) for the first few weeks. 

Now, though, I have some concerns things may have gone a touch too far. On Jan 4 I weighed 335 lbs. Today, just over a month later, I weighed in at 307. 28 lbs in a month - I should be over the moon, but I am worried. 

The medication essentially means I can eat when I want - I don‚Äôt really feel hungry anymore. I still get tummy gurgles and stuff from time to time but the meals I am eating are all healthy mindful options. But I feel like I am not eating enough. I come in between 750-1600 cal/day. And that‚Äôs if I force myself to eat. Sometimes when I eat I feel so full even though I only ate something small. One day - completely on accident - I forgot to eat until 8pm. 

My hope is this will give other users a place to speak about their experiences with medication and appetite. How did you cope with it? Is losing weight this fast healthy? What negative side effects could be happening if our calorie intake is this low but we genuinely aren‚Äôt hungry/can‚Äôt eat?

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

t3iplr,Month [6] Update - February,,5,1.0,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3iplr/month_6_update_february/,0,"SW: 310, CW: 256.2, GW: 220

I almost gave up. I don't know what February was but it almost ended my journey of weight loss. I started off the month strong but then fell into a hole. Not sure if it was due to the weather keeping me inside most of the month or just a loss of will due to being a few months in. I decided to scrap February out of my mind and mark it up as an error. I'll be continuing tomorrow fresh and going for a nice 5 mile hike to clear my mind and restart. It's a shame I should be 243 pounds right now but it's my fault. If anyone reads this and has the slightest bit of motivation I'll take it! I'm down 60 pounds but want to go another 30.

t3sinp,Excess uneaten calories as cheat meals,Question,0,0.5,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t3sinp/excess_uneaten_calories_as_cheat_meals/,7,"Hey lovely people.

I recently had an idea that I'm sure other people have already thought of. I have had a calorie limit for my daily eating ever since my diet, and I tend to be 100-200 calories under my daily limit each day. I was wondering if anyone tallies up these excess uneaten calories and then on a weekly cheat day, they eat a little bit more while remaining within their goals. A pseudo-cheat-meal if you will, since you aren't actually cheating.

Do people do something like this? Should this be weekly or bi-weekly count up? does this allow for cheat meals without compromising on goals? why or why not?

Thanks all, and apologies if this has been discussed in the past.

EDIT: if anyone knows if myfitness pal allows for this in an easy way please let me know

* Our primitive brain still reinforces consumption of foods with high caloric density. It has not evolved along with the increase of readily available foods. 

* Most of us are driven to eat more calories than we need, acting against our own self-interest despite our better judgement. 

* RRV^food , or how hard an individual is willing to work for food, differs person to person. A person's RRV^food paired with their impulsivity can determine the likelihood that that person will overeat or engage in other addictive behaviors. 

* In affluent and industrialized cultures we experience less sensory-specific satiety, like we live in a perpetual buffet. 

* The amount of money put into convincing us to eat far outweighs that put into preventing overeating. 

* We often make decisions that pit our present selves against our future selves because our intuitive brain has no concept of the future. When faced with the choice of eating a pastry or keeping $3, choosing the pastry *costs* our future self while the choice to save the $3 would *benefit* our future selves. 

* Today, it makes sense to value our future selves almost as much as our present selves, but the non-conscious brain regions that compute motivation and value haven't caught up. 

* Our lipostat works like a thermostat in a house. When a thermostat detects temperature, it engages the heat or AC to maintain homeostasis. Our lipostat performs similarly regarding our body fat; if a person loses fat, the lipstat engages to increase energy intake and reduce energy expenditure. It doesn't work as well to reduce intake and increase expenditure because the primitive nature of our brains prevents then from signaling ""I have enough body fat"". 

* ""High reward"" foods increase intake while ""low-reward foods"" decrease intake. The simple guidance of ""eat simple foods"" (rather than marketable calorie-dense foods) doesn't sustain either the weight loss industry or the food industry, and is therefore rarely marketed guidance.",1645983743.0

When you start this journey, you want to be building habits which you can keep up for a lifetime. Habits such as, tracking calories, understanding portion sizes, knowing the lower calorie alternatives, going out for walks, hitting the gym, and so on. Because the 'diet' shouldn't be temporary. If you think like this, I can assure you that you will either fail, or succeed temporarily until you start eating all the foods you love again, then you will revert back to your old self.

I plan to keep going my goal weight is 130-135. I can actually get in some more walking once it's warmer, and potentially purchase a rowing machine as well, but I really thought losing weight would make me feel better about myself. Not far worse. 

Any words of encouragement? 

Also note I have cerebral palsy AND exercise induced asthma so exercising is difficult. I can't use a large amount of the equipment and the ones I can I usually can't use long. I've just been blessed with all of the excuses to be unhealthy lol.",1646060032.0

Turned out I'm anemic. How long until I see weight loss with iron supplements?   

Long rant ahead...   
   
So my health kick started just over 6 months ago. I cut down on calories, eating consistently between 1200-1600 every day, used a food scale. Started roller derby as well. I hoped that the extra cardio plus the every day 1-hour dog walking would finally see me losing weight.   
   
I was starting out at 203 lbs and wanted to lose 30 lbs in 8 months.   
   
But I didnt. I actually gained 15 lbs. It killed me every time I weighed myself because I know what do to! I've lost over 100 lbs before using the exact same methodology. So why wasn't it working this time around? I couldn't wrap my head around it.

On top of that, my energy levels kept dropping and I was (still am) exhausted, despite taking naps in the middle of the day, falling asleep at 8:30pm once my toddler went to bed, and the multiple cups of coffee a day. And then my hair started to fall out, and the skin on my face and hands dried so much they would crack and bleed. My joints would hurt. I was always cold and weak. Then I started getting really breathless, even just lying down. I suddenly needed inhalers and was dependent on them several times a day.    

I chalked it all up to my hypothyroidism acting up and the breathlessness to a bout of bronchitis I had over the winter.  My GP assured me to hang on, that my thyroid medication would kick in and it was just a harder winter for everyone. I then cut out sugar for a month, but I still didn't lose any weight.   
    
About a week ago, I just had enough. I sent a message to my GP surgery that something was wrong and I needed my blood checked immediately. A new GP had joined and he agreed and insisted on testing my iron levels alongside my thyroid.   

Boom - anemic.   

My iron levels had dropped by half in 8 months. My thyroid levels showed I was over-medicated. When I looked up the symptoms of both, it explained all of my symptoms - including my inability to lose weight.   
   
Now I'm on a lower dosage of levothyroxin and on iron supplements. It's been two days, and I am feeling more energetic. But I feel like crying. I've wasted the last 6 months and my body was fighting hard against me the entire time. According to my MFP, I should have lost 24 lbs by now and it kills me that now I just have more to lose. To say that I hate my body is an understatement.      
   
I just needed to rant because I feel so deflated and disgusted with myself. Please tell me it's going to be ok. Please, if anyone else has a similar story, how long did it it take for you to start seeing weight loss? I can't take this feeling of disgust and hatred I have for my body any more.",1645981259.0

I was on form with my calories which I count meticulously (measure everything from liquids to spices to solids) in the week. Restaurant food would be dinners or lunches only on the weekends - other meals would be my regular foods.  For some restaurants they publish their nutrition- that was helpful and I stayed in calories. But for most restaurants I went to that was not possible. So I made ‚Äòthe best choice on the menu‚Äô and a best guess of the calories. 

This resulted in 0lb lost in 4 weeks! Now I could be bummed about that, and I won‚Äôt lie it‚Äôs a bit annoying. For me it shows:

1) if  I can‚Äôt count it precisely or if someone else has not counted it for me I could be way off on the estimates 

2) tasty salt, sugar and oil goodness in restaurant food is possibly contributing to my underestimations when I ate out  and contribute to bloat

3) this is why I reduced eating out to once a month 

I used to be one of the folks who would take it more easy on weekends than weekdays. I stopped doing that because I realised my progress would stall. This month confirmed it for me

To give you a quick overview of the numbers here are the percentages:

\- Fats: 0 - 3%

\- Carbs: 5 - 10%

\- Protein: 20 - 30%

My question is are any of you taking those extra calories into account when calculating your TDEE?

I am a bit confused about this topic and never heard people actually talk about it in context with your daily energy expenditure. As someone who recently started to keep an eye on my protein intake and my macros it seems to make sense to take things like the thermic effect of food into account. I mean its not a just a tiny amount of calories we are talking about here. 

For example, my daily intake of Protein is a minimum of 150g Protein which in that case means i am eating at least 600 calories (150g \* 4cal = 600cal) a day of protein. Disregarding the other macro nutrients , my body would burn an extra 100-200 calories just to process and metabolize the proteins every day.

There have been a few weeks the scale said I hadn't lost any weight. It's been VERY slow.  Much slower than the math predicts. Yet I can't seem to get out of the habit of drinking one or two days a week. A part of me doesn't really want to give up all social engagements again. 

This is supposed to be a lifestyle change. I'm starting to wonder if I should just accept that 1200 isn't sustainable for me anymore and my weight loss from here on out is going to be painfully slow.",1646012991.0

Stats:

I started getting back in shape 1/3/22, and I have tracked every day. I have lost 7.4lbs.


I rock climb 1-2x a week, and weight lift 3 times a week.


My daily calorie intake is around ~1,600 calories.


I weight and track everything including oils. I cook 95% of my own meals and snacks.


I love this subreddit so much. The first time I got in shape this place was a life saver and now that I'm doing it again I appreciate the community so much. I feel like I've been stuck gaining and losing the same 5 lbs for the last month. For example, 2/20/22 I weighed 216.1 and on 2/25/22 I weighted 214.2. I stepped on the scale yesterday and I was back up to 220.2. I do have a little fun on Friday nights and I tend to under budget it for about 200-300 calories.  Most weeks my friends host dinner and hang out. It's the one day a week I allow myself to drink and have some sweets like oreos or a brownie.


I really do feel like I'm stuck around 216 lbs and have been since January. I am getting back into weight lifting and I am 25 year old woman so I know those are factors but I thought I'd be closer to 200 lbs by now.


Am I going crazy? Am I doing something wrong? Do I just need to give it more time? 
Should I completely give up on cheat days/meals until I hit my first goal of being under 200 lbs?  I've been down to 170 lbs before and I do not remember it being this unstable before.
 

I just take such a mental hit seeing the crazy jumps from Friday night to Sunday morning.",1646052882.0

I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight since the pandemic made me gain 40 pounds on the dot around 2 years ago. I‚Äôd been trying everything but mainly eating better and CICO.

It wasn‚Äôt working! I was losing weight but veeerrrryyyy slowly. 6 months into it I had only lost 10 pounds and stalled around 150. My weight then fluctuated for another 6ish months from 150-155.

I finally found out what I was doing wrong. I was RELIGIOUSLY counting calories and was getting very, very aggravated that I seemingly couldn‚Äôt lose weight.

It was the alcohol! I‚Äôm a junior in college and drinking with my friends was a major part of my weekly life. I ended up contracting mononucleosis that messed up my liver and in return I spent a month without drinking.

It took me 6 months previously to lose 10 pounds and when I contracted mono I was 155. In just 1 month I have lost 12 pounds, 17 total, and the lbs just keep shedding off.

I knew I wasn‚Äôt overeating! I was only consuming 1,200 calories a day but adding alcohol on top (and not logging the cals) ended with me not being able to lose weight.

I can‚Äôt visibly see my weight loss yet but my old jeans (from when I was 120 lbs) are able to zip!! They‚Äôre not comfortable yet but it‚Äôs way better than them being stuck around my thighs. 

Sorry for the long post but I just had to tell someone!

TL;DR: Couldn‚Äôt lose weight with CICO, almost gave up, figured out it was the alcohol! 12 lbs lost in 1 month, 17 total.

To put it simply, it's all BS! The one thing that every single one of these 'diets' will have in common is that they put the individual in a calorie deficit. This meaning that the individual will burn more calories than they consume on a day to day basis, resulting in weight loss.

Whether this is done by removing meals (such as with intermittent fasting), by removing entire food groups (such as with keto), and so on, all diets will put the individual into this calorie deficit.

Normally, I gain weight on vacation. Because I'm eating out most of the time, AND I don't have access to a bathroom or kitchen scale. And it's just hard to stay mentally on track while I'm away enjoying myself. 

I've been on vacation for the past week, visiting friends and family. 

My parents cooked a few meals, but I ate out a few times. I've been out with friends, visited my grandparents who always have sugary treats on offer, and I even *attended a wedding with a buffet* while I was away.

Before I went away I was 144.4lbs. I got home last night, stepped on the scale this morning and I am **143.8lbs!**

It's only a 0.6lb loss but I am THRILLED!

Normally, I'd gain several pounds on a week long vacation. Some of that would be water weight, but after the water came off I'd find I had gained at least a pound of fat.

This time, I was hoping I'd be able to maintain my weight and wasn't expecting a loss at all. I just tried to make sensible choices, and try to limit snacks wherever possible. 

For example I only had 1 cookie from the big plate my grandparents offered around, when usually I'd have several. At the wedding buffet, I made myself a plate with some treats and some veggies, and only had that one plate rather than going back for more and more.

t30k3j,Scared to not fit in my theatre costume after binge eating,,6,0.8,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t30k3j/scared_to_not_fit_in_my_theatre_costume_after/,6,"Hi guys! One of my hobbies is theatre and the performance days are coming up. In three days' time.

The costume I have to wear (blouse and skirt) fit just fine when I first had them fitted at the end of November. I actually meant to lose some weight in the months between then and now, but I had a really stressful period and I gained a little. Nothing too bad, though, it wasn't noticeable.

For the past ten days, however, I stayed with friends and all the things we ate consisted mostly of sugar  - I don't think I've had a 'normal' or healthy meal at all. Once I had some sugary things (I'd been eating pretty healthy for the last months), my binge eating problem came right back. I started sneaking food to the bathroom to eat it, when they were not looking. I had chocolate, pancakes, muffins, ice cream, cereal, croissants etc... It's all I can think about now and I think that scares me the most.

Needless to say, my face is round like the moon. My stomach is not even flat when I hold it in anymore and my clothes are ill-fitting. But it's mostly my face, it feels so swollen and when I look in the mirror I'm repulsed by what I see.

I'm terribly afraid that I messed it all up and that I'll look ugly for the play and that my clothes will not fit properly. I know I'm probably not thinking straight anymore, and it's the sugar talking, but I've really lost all confidence and feel so bad about myself.

Is there any way to feel better? I'm not asking for a way to 'fix it fast', because I know it's a myth, but I would like to feel a bit better (not sluggish and constipated like I do now), and get back on track before the play.

I'm panicking, I don't want to go back to before, when my binge eating took over my life. Any and every advice from you is greatly appreciated!",1646003562.0

3) I recently got back in the actual gym again after being afraid to go in there for the last two years.

As of this morning, my current weight is 261.5 lbs so I'm at 16.5 lbs lost over 2 months.  I've not been consistent with the ideal diet nor exercise, but it's turned around now.  Vast majority of my weight loss occurred in January and early in Feb I somewhat fell off the wagon when it came to late night snacking.  I still do so on occasion but last couple have been more controlled.  Some of my thoughts below:

* It's like a ""Tale of Two Cities""... very easy some days but so hard on other days.  The old cliche ""1 day at a time"" is true.
* Exercise ranges from 30 - 60 min per day, so I haven't been needing to do a lot of it to lose.  Makes sense since your diet controls the majority of weight loss (or gain).
* I'm expecting things to get easier once we get into spring.  There's only so much you can do when cooped up in the house due to weather and cold.
* My biggest issue appears to be the snacking.  While our food in general has improved from a health standpoint, I still like to make good tasting meals and that hasn't changed at all.
* Cooking at home >> eating out.  Unless you're eating at a really high quality restaurant, you're getting sick after eating out.  The only time I don't feel ill eating out is at a decent quality sushi place.  I only order avocado rolls, tuna rolls and  tuna (various types) and salmon nigiri.  Some of my foods are in my profile that I've posted to different subs if curious.
* CICO, strength training and cardio (high intensity and/or low intensity) are the only tools you need to lose weight.  Everything else is a gimmick.  Caveats are that the exercise programs for strength training and your cardio are sound.  Regarding food, you can eat whatever you want provided you don't exceed your calorie goals.
* Just because you can eat whatever you want it doesn't mean you should do that cart blanche.  I find that for most days on CICO, balanced food groups to get all the protein, vitamins and minerals are important.  With less calories, your margin for error regarding nutrition is smaller, so eat responsibly most days.  Fortunately, a couple days of eating junk is okay occasionally so long as you keep your calorie goals in mind.

Do someone(male) has experience of losing weight and having fat on their chest while being obese? Was it easy to lost this fat and did your chest changed somehow? 

From one side it easy to find exercises for making chest muscles, but also I read a lot of posts about problems with losing chest fat. So is it really easy to lost chest fat and stop having small breasts?

Also I found some examples on /progresspics but nothing about information what should I do to decrease size of my chest. Now I am 23 years old male, 115 kg.",1645981883.0

I‚Äôve tired increasing my protein intake, eating more veggies, having my meals later on in the day, but I still feel hungry.

I haven‚Äôt gained any weight but I also haven‚Äôt lost any either. Which means I‚Äôm eating too much and need to either exercise more or reduce my calories. 

But increasing exercise will probably make me even more hungry and reducing calories seems difficult since I  currently have trouble not going over.",1645958254.0

t2xbyc,When should I expect results + realistic waist measurement goal?,Question,2,0.75,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t2xbyc/when_should_i_expect_results_realistic_waist/,2,"I've lost a whopping one kilo since I started, so I'm 6 kilos behind the schedule, so what I'm doing clearly isn't working. Which means I'll have to start exercising and I'm going to be honest with y'all. I hate exercising, but I'll have to behave like a grown-up and do what I do whenever I have to do things I don't want to do for a long time: count the days till I don't have to do it anymore. I've used that method successfully at work and with school things, and I think once I've seen some results I'd be more motivated to continue. 

BUT I digress, to the questions:

1. How many days should I put on my morning comb? I was thinking I could do one of those youtube things where they tell you to do stuff for x amount of days for ""incredible super fast and awesome results"" because they still probably do at least something? And by results I mean cm's lost as you can lose or gain just water weight. I've been thinking maybe doing blogilates, but if you have recommendations, please share. No Chloe Ting tho, I don't like her music choices :D 
2. Setting target weight is rather simple, you just look at BMI charts, but with weight measurements I haven't found anything else than be under 80 cm. So I googled and apparently 53 cm uncorseted is really small. The apple pear index doesn't really say much as it's hip and waist, while BMI is weigh and height, and I'm not going to grow any taller, but the hip measurement could change. I played with the calculator and if you lose 5 cm from both hip and waist, your index remains pretty much the same, if you want to get a low index point (the lower the better) you need a small waist and big ass. But I'm losing weight, so obviously my behind isn't just going to get bigger and I think it would be very demotivating to lose cm but still have the same index number.  So yeah, how should I choose a good goal? Suggestions are okay, too, because I don't understand anything about these and even with a tape measure helping me I have hard time understanding this. 
3. Also, what kilo x cm (waist) rate would be ideal? Should I expect for example to lose 1 cm per kilo or is that unrealistic? Or is this entire thing stupid?

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

Just putting this here because I spend a lot of time in this sub and things like this help me keep myself accountable. 

28F 5'4.5"" HW: 195 lbs. SW: 193.8 lbs. CW: 164 lbs. GW: 140 lbs.

**September (Month 1):** \- 10.6 :. **Lowest weigh-in:** 183.2 lbs.  
**October (Month 2):** \- 11.6 lbs. **Lowest weigh-in:** 171.6 lbs.   
**November (Month 3):** \+ 2.2 lbs. **Lowest weigh-in:** 173.8 lbs.  
**December (Month 4):** \- 2.6 lbs. **Lowest weigh-in:** 171.2 lbs.  
**January (Month 5)**: - 3.6 lbs. **Lowest weigh-in:** 167.6 lbs.  
**February (Month 6):** \- 3.6 lbs. **Lowest weigh-in:** 164 lbs. 

**My Routine:**  
I use MyFitnessPal (Premium), Happy Scale, and Apple Watch to help set and keep track of my goals. I currently do 1200 calories/day Monday thru Friday and 1500 calories/day on weekends. I eat at maintenance (About 1650 calories/day) during that special time of the month. I'd be a liar if I said that I stuck to this plan perfectly at all times, because I don't. I go over my maintenance calories several times a month (life happens). Macros are not a huge concern to me, but I do try to meet the protein goal set by MFP.

In terms of exercise, I do a mix of cardio and strength training. I go the gym 2-4x a week and try to walk or run 4+ times a week. I am currently resting from an injury, but anticipate getting back into running within the next day or so. 

**NSVs:**  
\- Upon starting my weight loss journey, my average mile time was about 12 minutes. My fastest mile time to date is 7:41, and my average mile time is about 9 minutes.

\- My resting heart rate used run between 70-75 bpm. It now runs between 55-60 bpm. 

\- There was a pair of jeans I purchased at the start of my journey. They fit now, and are starting to become loose. I anticipate needing a new pair of goal jeans in the near future. 

\- I was able to size down in workout leggings, from a Large to a Medium this month!

**Goals for March**:  
\- Get down to 161 lbs. I've found that setting smaller goals to hit each month has been really helpful, especially since my rate of loss has decreased over time. 

\- Run a total of 50 miles. 

\- Don't give up.",1645913442.0
t303ac,Most efficient way to stop being skinny fat?,,0,0.44,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t303ac/most_efficient_way_to_stop_being_skinny_fat/,7,"I'm 180 LBS, and I'm also 5""7 and a 20 year old Male. I am what people will call ""skinny-fat"". I appear very skinny when wearing clothing, because my arms and legs are really skinny, but in reality I have a belly and man boobies. And I'm honestly not sure what is the absolute best way to get rid of this. I dont want to gain muscle, or anything like that at all. All I want is to just simply get rid of the belly and man boobies so that they are not there anymore, and so that my entire body appears skinny, and not just my legs and arms.

To give a brief run down of my diet, I usually have the same food every day. I have a bowl of special k yogurt cereal with milk in the morning, 4 slices of red baron pizza for lunch OR spaghetti. And then dinner is white rice with some ground beef and a banana to give it a nice, sweet taste. Depending on certain days, I may have some generic snacks like chips, granola bars, or just general sugary stuff like vanilla pudding or ice cream at random points throughout the day. My lunch, breakfast, and dinner usually dont change for the most part, unless I swap out something for lunch from dinner, or vice versa. I occasionally may eat some processed food like taquitos or hot pockets, or eat toast with cream cheese instead of cereal.

I honestly want to at least put in some sort of effort to get rid of the skinny fat look and just be purely skinny. I'm lucky in the sense that, as long as I have clothes on I won't be called fat, but I want more than that. I want to be *actually* skinny. I'm willing to try any reccomendations but I just need a good starting point or some good first steps/a general plan would all be nice",1646002276.0

Could I be gaining muscle, or what am I doing wrong? I‚Äôm considered obese so even if I‚Äôm gaining muscle, I should still be dropping weight. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, should I see a doctor? I‚Äôm 100% certain in my calorie calculations. I weigh everything.",1645986568.0

Is this all a win for me - and is it weight from muscle? Or should I try harder and finally get myself to the gym to see that weight come off with cardio machines? I‚Äôm very happy with my diet and my low glycemic index diet has allowed me to eat in a deficit anyways.

***BACKGROUND***

\- Female, 22yrs old, 5‚Äô3

\- CW:100kg (220lbs) GW: 65-70kg

\- Exisiting conditions: PCOS and Hidradentis Supperativa, previously experienced high blood pressure (unsure of what triggered it) 

\- Sedentary lifestyle as I work 9-5 and sit at a desk all day

***WEIGHTLOSS PLAN***

**Phase 1: GW 90kg**

\-Setting no timescale, this will be a lifestyle change and will take as long as it takes!

\- Plan to do this strictly through CICO and nutrition and building healthy habits

\- Use TDEE and find deficit of around 400-500 calories. 

\- Balanced eating, no cutting food groups (focus on higher protein and lower carb)

\- Taking supplements for my deficiencies; vitamin D, Iron and Omega 3

\- Focus on reducing inflammation and insulin resistance

**Phase 2: GW 80kg**

\- Focus on moving more 

\-  Walking 10k steps daily 

\- Using step counter 

\- improving mobility and flexibility 

\- Weekly fitness classes where possible 

**Phase 3: 70-65kg** 

\- Start going to the gym regularly (3/4x a week) 

\- Lifting and cardio 

\- Focus on toning up and maintenance

I struggle with discipline, commitment, self control and I'm hoping by starting slowly and relying on routine instead of motivation will help me.

Problem is I've seen Zero changes, given that i train 90 minutes per week and HATE cardio, that's why i use the treadmill, also the fact that christmas, new year, etc came followed by family holidays probably helped me gain weight instead of losing it.

I have eating habits, experience in tracking macros, reading labels, etc. I find it hard to drop some weight, I know that I am still impatient. I want to convince myself that I am in the right direction even if I go slow. I feel discouraged sometimes and my brain is making all those theories up (slow weight loss at a healthy weight).

Today marked a pretty  important milestone for me. I have now lost 60Kg (photos are both a  bit out of date, I have lost about another 5Kg since the more recent one  and I was a bit heavier that the original one there).  
I have gone from \~145Kg to 84Kg. Some stats about this weight loss  
BMI has dropped from 42 to 24.   
Resting heart rate has gone from mid 70‚Äôs to mid 50‚Äôs  
Doctors  have told me that based on blood work not only have I prevent a very  early death but they say I have blood work/blood pressure and other  indicators closer to that of someone 10yrs my junior  
My fitness level has gone through the roof as well.  


The story behind this is that post COVID locakdown I hit a really low point mentally. I was eating horribly an was utterly miserable, to the point where I knew if I kept going the way I was it wasn't going to be long before I died.

My wife asked me if I want to have weight loss surgery so I looked into it and, for me, I felt like I wouldn't learn anything about weight loss if I did this and I knew I would just slip back into old habits and waste the money. So I decided to give weight loss a proper try. I knew that I knew nothing about eating properly or exercise. I spent the first month working on why I was eating what I was eating. What was I getting out of it? For me it was emotional eating, I ate for comfort, to feel better, especially when I was depressed. I hadn't properly dealt with the passing of our eldest daughter from an eating disorder. Mentally realising that I was doing the exact same thing as she was but in reverse hit me hard. I also made the conscious decision that I didn't want to die an I wanted to be around for my wife and kids.

With the mental work well on the way I needed to figure out what would work for me food wise. I am not a morning person so breakfast needed to be fast and I needed to be able to prep my lunch really quickly as I ran out the door to work.

Food prep on a Sunday became critical. I am super lucky that I can eat the same thing day in day out an be fine. Chicken breast, brown rice and broccoli every day for lunch in a frozen container, nice an easy.

Dinner was already fine as my wife has always eaten well. 

I cut out all the chips I was eating and started going to bed at a reasonable time. Finishing work at 2am after eating 2 large bags of chips and a 2lt bottle of coke had taken its toll and was a big contributor to my weight.

I made a lot of diet mistakes on the way with eating way too few calories for a long time. Being 120kg and eating 1400 kcal is not great!

If you want to know what I do here is the list  
Mon-Fri: Gym for weight lifting using the Stronger by Science program for hypertrophy  
Tues & Thurs: stationary bike spin class on Apple Fitness+  
Wed: Yoga  
Sat: Bike or Martial Art session for conditioning (push ups, sit ups, dips, squats, punch kicks, loads of bag work) for around 1hr (this depends on how beat up I feel from my week at the gym)  
Sun: Yoga  


Food  wise I eat high protein and 99% whole foods. I track my foods with  MacroFactor app.  


Sounds like a lot huh? Well if you want to  start, start small that is what I did. First get your food right. Find  your Total Daily Energy Expenditure TDEE and minus 500 calories. Then  split that calories into your macros of about 40/40/20 for protein,  carbs and fat. Once you have done that just move a bit more, walking,  couch 2 5K, gym whatever, find what works for you.  


Things I have learnt  
1. You can‚Äôt out run a bad diet  
2. Weight Lifting is highly important for improving you metabolism and building muscle  
3. Cardio is great for weight loss but weight training is still overall better  
4. Finding r/fitness  and r/loseit where I could ask dumb questions was super important  
5.  Finding people who‚Äôs advice I trusted was huge. YouTube content  creators like Jeff Nippard, Stronger by Science (Greg Nukols & Eric  Tressler), Dr. Mike Isratel, AlphDestiny  
6. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable - pushing your self is important, not to the point of injury but always striving to be better than last work out pushed me as I went along.  
7. Sleep is sooooo important for weight loss, 7-9hrs/night is massively important to weight loss and craving management.  
8. Weight and track your food - MacroFactor is amazing for this  


From  here on out I am going to keep doing what I am doing because I love  this amount of activity and I am working on recomp at a 100-200kcal deficit while building muscle and  strength with the aim of dropping to around 15% BF down from around 19% currently. 

I really hope this helps someone, please dont get disheartened by how much you need to lose, break it up into small goals and remember it is a marathon not a sprint. You can do it! Find your why and hold onto it, it will make the blood sweat and tears all the more easy.",1645845321.0

I figured I would drop a few pounds to maintain a healthier BMI. I started with MFP with a goal of losing 10 lb, which I did slowly and easily. However, I have a very obsessive personality, so I go very strict about counting and losing, to the point where I kept reducing my goal weight and my deficit was affecting me mentally and physically. 

This is where I tell you BMI is kinda BS and healthy weight looks different on anyone. Even though I was not underweight, and had a BMI of about 20, I was experiencing coldness, blue nails, hair loss, loss of period, depression, etc. You could see my bones start to poke out. I naturally have a wider skeletal frame, so that‚Äôs probably why. I am pretty sure I had an eating disorder. 

This was all too much for me and triggered a 6-week long binge phase that caused me to regain the 20 lbs I had worked so hard to lose. I also developed a lot of body hate and it‚Äôs been emotionally very hard. 

While the first week or so I was overeating out of hunger, as I mentioned before, I tend to be obsessive and binge eating quickly became a habit. I‚Äôve been trying really hard to break it to no avail. 

I found myself trying to revert to my unhealthy ways of losing weight, but I‚Äôm so done. If I‚Äôm going to get the body I want, I'm going to do it through eating healthy and exercising, not by starving myself. 

And no more of this body hate. I‚Äôm so sick of putting my life on hold until I love my body. I might as well love it and take care of it now and be patient, and end up with a healthier body, than destroy my life to be skinny.

So to start this off, i was obese (20/M 256lbs at 5'8), with a bmi of 39, i was basically 4-6lbs away from being classified as morbidly obese, but thankfully, i turned my life around, lost the weight, and got to a healthy weight of 138-140lbs, when people ask me ""how did you do this?"", I lie, because i am truly ashamed of admitting how i lost the majority of my weight, but if you are curious, it was through smoking and drinking monster energy drinks (both are stimulants, and you will soon understand why that worked)

Besides weight and binge eating (which was still there even after losing all my weight) issues, all my life i struggled with low energy, mood swings, the inability to focus and finish tasks and the inability to do many normal things (such as brushing my teeth, showering etc), but i always blamed it on my weight, after all being obese leads to low T levels.

So did all of these improve after i lost the weight? Nope.

Told myself that it could be a result of low T, got my blood work done and that shit was solid, but then i stumbled upon a subreddit, r/ADHD

Now i always suspected that i had ADHD, but i also thought people with ADHD were also hyperactive ( i mean, its in the name) compared to me who struggled to just get out of bed, but i did more research on it, and it felt like someone wrote.a book about my life, i related to almost every single thing ADHD people had, so i decided that maybe i should go to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with depression and he put me on CBT, decided to get a second opinion so i went to another psychiatrist and he told me that i most likely have ADHD and that my depression might be caused by my ADHD, got diagnosed and was put on medications


Life.fucking.changing, it felt like i finally got glasses for my bad vision, i mean i knew it was bad but i never realised it was THAT bad, in this 2 months of being on medications not only did i memoies every lecture after class (which i would always procrastinate until a day before exams), have energy throughout the day, focuse during conversations and classes, build new healthy habits (brush my teeth and wash myself daily) but the most unexpected benefit i got from getting on medications is how i am no longer hungry all the time, the food i eat now satiates me and that the water i drink now quenches my thirst, it is a night and day difference, i never realised that my brain constantly seeked food not because i was hungry, but because it was actively seeking stimulants, food was the only thing that made me happy and energised, and suddenly it made sense why smoking and drinking a shit ton of caffeinated drinks helped me during my weightloss (and i have since quit smoking after getting on medications)

Food is no longer in control of my life, gone the days of not going out with my buddies to eat because i was afraid it was just going to lead to me binging, it really made me wish that i should have focused on my mental health instead of thinking a number on the scale is going to fix all my issues.",1645888860.0

The day after a stag do, I was less than enthusiastic to go to. Interacting with family I'm not particularly fond of.  I got around 4 hours sleep and woke up feeling irritable and craving food, part of my years old feel good routine.

My first instinct was to reject my brains answer for food and try be a puritan, a calorie connoisseur and the man who would make my recent healthy choices, but then it hit me. Why am I actually trying to improve my health if I'm not allowed to be human and crave things that perhaps aren't the best once in a while. It was at this moment I decided to make a Compromise. I'm done relying on Willpower for success and instead wish to use long term smarter choices to guide my health.

I'd stick to my calorie goal for the day, but scratch my cravings. In this case a quarter pounder meal with a medium fries and a diet coke. After that I've had a lighter meal for the evening. A simple sandwich with salad & white meat and left room to graze on smaller snack items.

You don't have to choose to punish yourself for wanting food that isn't 'healthy' you just need to acknowledge your craving itch in a way that wont derail you. 

I'm hoping this rant will help others free themselves from the judgement our inner monologue can give us sometimes, ultimately the voice in our head is never going to be kind to us when we're in a bad state of mind, so sometimes you have to be the one to show that kindness.",1645895311.0

I started at 286 pounds and recently hit 165 pounds. It wasn't an easy experience as it was filled with nothing but plateaus, yo-yo dieting, that sort of thing. It was mostly because while I've been very attentive with all the food I've been eating, what with writing everything down on MyFitnessPal and scanning everything, the biggest obstacle that has always been giving me troubles is my own mom and her cooking.

My mom means the best when it comes to cooking but I've realized over the past few months that mom never actually bothers to measure anything for the meals she cooks. Anytime I ask her to keep the labels, ingredients or just tell me how much of the stuff she portions out, she just gets mad and yells ""IT'S HEALTHY BECAUSE IT'S FISH/IT SAYS FAT FREE/SOUP DOESN'T MAKE YOU FAT"" etc etc etc. She has the tendency to buy stuff that says fat free/no sugar/0 cholesterol but I can never trust those these days, so it got to point where I decided to buy a foodscale in order to start getting even more accurate measures for everything, from mom's cooking to simply measuring the fruits, vegetables and snacks I've been buying for myself.

So now mom gets pretty mad anytime I bring out the scale when dinner time arrives, yelling that I'm wasting time measuring everything. In her eyes, she thinks 8oz of fish is the same as 8oz of pork, 8oz of cheese, etc. etc. She's already telling me to return the scale because she views it as a scam (obviously I won't do that, I need to continue losing weight). It really doesn't help that although I want to continue losing weight to get rid of the rest of my man boobs and love handles, EVERYONE in the family is telling me to stop because I look fine.

I just needed to vent this out because I don't have anyone I can turn to for this. It's like I'm the only one trying to be healthy and everyone views me as a crazy, starving nutcase. What can I do to try and explain my side of the story here to my family/mom?

&#x200B;

\*2/28/22 EDIT\* First off, I want to say thank you to everyone who commented here to tell me their side of the story while also shedding some light on the mistakes I made here. I fully admit that I was somewhat in the wrong here to be demanding my mom, who enjoys cooking, to start measuring everything they typically do by heart. I had a talk with my mom, who started to understand my side of the story. To clear a few things in the air since some folks assumed certain things due my vague post, my mom is actually on the healthy side of things. She didn't fatten me up. I did that to myself because I'd typically spend more time outside eating burgers and fries. When I began my journey, I became very fixated on the numbers game and that left my mind clouded when asking mom to start helping me out. Right now, mom is still a bit weirded out that I'll be measuring everything out with the scale but she understands now it isn't me being disrespectful but rather just being careful. I made sure to tell her her cooking was fantastic and that the leftover portions will be kept for me to eat at work. Everything is now at peace. Thank you all for the support. I love you all.",1645798819.0

Okay so, in the first meeting what i told her was that I need help with my diet because I have struggled with weight my whole life and want something that I can take and follow for the rest of my life. I was excited after that first meeting to get the plan. A week later I get my instructions from her and what she has put together is so strict and feels like it was not made for someone my size at all. It feels like something that was made for herself

Here are the rules she gave - note all of her ‚Äúservings‚Äù are less than what any of the serving sizes on the packaging is:

-up to 2 servings of grains per day (serving is 1/2 cup cooked)
- up to 1 starchy vegetable per day
- up to 2 beans/legume servings per day (1/2 cup serving)
- at least 2 non starchy vegetables per day
- at most 3 servings of fruit a day
- at most 4 servings of healthy fat a day.
- no more than 2 servings of lean protein a day, and it has to be wild caught, pasture raised, grass fed, etc.
- no calorie goal, just ‚Äúfollow this exactly and you‚Äôll lose weight‚Äù
- no cheat meals

She also gave me extremely specific brands she wants me to buy and only eat those, even though they are at least twice the price of generic.

After a couple of days following this, 1) I‚Äôm starving, 2) I haven‚Äôt been able to hit more than 1700 calories and 3) I‚Äôm driving myself insane trying to find the products she wants me to use. I would just stop but I‚Äôve already paid for 7 sessions with her.

When I've tried to lose weight before, I've either used the scale and become completely obsessive over it, (my morning being ruined if I'm up a couple pounds), or I've not used it and my efforts have been ineffectual. I realised I need to incorporate the scale on some level, and I've finally found a way that works.

In order to not freak out when my weight goes up, **I am also not allowed to get super excited when my weight goes down**. I find keeping both positive AND negative associations in check makes it far easier to detach and ""trust the process"".

Also, I now weigh diligently every day at the same time. Firstly, it helps me view the overall trend and removes the noise of day by day fluctuations. Secondly, I used to avoid weighing after a cheat day because I figured it ""didn't count"". But I found that removed accountability and led to multiple cheat days in a row. Seeing the scale go up gives me motivation to get back on track.

On an unrelated note, I never restrict calories more after a cheat day, I simply return to how I was eating before. Otherwise it feels too much like punishment.

I put on this weight during COVID because my love affair with wine and cheese was out of control. I was about 55-56kg before (December 2019) and the stress of COVID and my job (teaching - why did I choose this career again? üòÇ) meant I was coming home every day feeling like I deserved to enjoy myself by grazing on all my favourite foods. 

I've learnt so much from y'all over the past year and wanted to thank you for all your helpful advice! I've made some huge changes to my diet, I don't keep wine or low nutrient foods in the house and I've taken up running which I absolutely love! Seriously, it changed my life - started with couch to 5k and now am working on my first marathon! If you've written off running in your mind I would encourage you to rethink it, I didn't think I could do it but couch to 5k proved I could and I liked having a program that I could tick off week by week (helped me feel like I achieved something, especially on plateau weeks - dam you hormones!)

 I do have a tendency to overeat for enjoyment (cause food is delicious) and it's especially bad when I'm stressed.

The longest I have ever been a diet is for about a month and a half. It was KETO and I did lose about 8 pounds without cheating. At some point, I had a normal meal with carbs and was stuck with horrible stomach pain for a good week. I've also had troubles with my bowel movement on KETO anyway as well as lack of energy. I realized that this type of diet is geared towards a particular lifestyle and I honestly didn't want to carry on eating in such a way. So, I stopped. This was two years ago. Since then, I've managed to hold on to the little bit of weight I had shed off by occasionally exercising and limiting my food intake when I noticed my weight go up a few pounds. I fasted, I cut out sugars and carbs and it wasn't hard. I did 30-45 minutes of cardio every single day for two weeks. But for the past few months, I can't seem to stop eating/binging. I eat anything and everything in sight. It doesn't matter if I'm hungry or if I like the food or not. It's geared towards sweets mostly. I've been trying to go back to my old ways of restricting myself to one snack a day to none at all as that is what has caused me to gain the weight back but, I can't even do it for a week. I can't get rid of the snacks and desserts because the world/family doesn't revolve around me. I don't want to force my family in giving up things they love to eat because of me. I've tried counting my calories but I find it so tedious and can't seem to stick to it. I've tried intermittent fasting but I have no motivation to continue. I know I sound like a whiny kid with my silly excuses but, I seriously can't stop. I'm sick of thinking about food all the time. I'm tired of feeling so guilty at the end of the day when I realize how much I ate. I understand that there is no fast way to lose weight but I don't want to diet and exercise and worry about what the scale says. I want to ask on what I should do? How do I regain the motivation that I lost and not end up binging? I'm 153 pounds (69KG) and 5'3 (160 cm). (I prefer to keep my age hidden. )",1645902144.0

i stopped bringing small snacks into my house when i started this journey because i knew i was going to binge eat whenever i open one packet, so i stopped doing that all together in the first 4 months. i fully focused on intermittent fasting and whole foods, as well as learning about my macros and just getting 5-10k steps in a day. i did intermittent fasting purely to discipline myself around food.

In january it was my birthday, so i took a whole week off from tracking and just ate whatever i wanted, but i didnt even want to eat whatever i want, i genuinely loved tracking my food and hitting the gym! but i still ate my normal meals without tracking and i literally gained only 800 grams. 

but after that, i got strict on myself, i needed to lose 3-4kgs by the 28th because i weighed 97.8 and my trainer is weighing me on the 28th, now i weigh 94.5, hoping to lose a bit more by monday. 

heres the fun part, i got my period last week and i was craving chocolate like crazy, but instead of binging or eating outside my deficit, i went to the movies, got a small popcorn with 3 chocolate bars around 700 calories. went back home, had a 500 calorie dinner, for breakfast i only had a smoothie, i wasnt craving much that day except for chocolate.

and just now, my mum had bought cookies and i had coffee in my hand and i had 1000 calories left for the day, its 3pm, so i took 2 cookies for 160 calories and ate them and now i feel so good that i had to share it with you guys. 

i just wanted to say, if youre here because of fat loss and struggle with emotional eating, it really does get better, one day you will appreciate food as fuel so much, you start to realise that you only ever needed two cookies, you start to eat your food slowly and enjoy it so much, instead of cramming it into your body without realising that foods like that are meant to be enjoyed and not ""nourishing"" (sure as hell nourished my soul lol), the nourishing foods are the ones you are supposed to fix your outlook on, its not dieting, its learning how to eat things without guilt, its 80/20, its having an amazing breakfast with eggs, toast and avocado with a chocolate bar and coffee in the middle of the day because you want to and because it fits well within your deficit.

i never knew id be this person, i am 8 pounds away from being under 200 pounds, i am gaining muscle and losing fat, i am a new person, i am so energised and happy and my life just seems so full and new again. i wish you all a healthy journey like mine!",1645842191.0

But I'm super frustrated. To lose weight I need to eat 1500 calories. I reach that goal, but by evening I end up getting hungry and eating up to 2000. I'm sedentary as hell so I don't understand why I get hungry.

Grocery shopping is an issue because I have a disorder (going to therapy for) in which I have a hard time doing that myself and I depend on my mother for it.

There will be times I ask her for ingredients for some recipes but she doesn't have the time to go to the grocery store to supply veggies or fruits every week. I don't think I have any consistency.

Should I just try to discipline myself all the way and eat one meal a day? What do I do? I know I can do this but why does it feel so hard? I feel so defeated for eating 2000 calories today. Any advice would be appreciated.

Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing great.
I started my weight loss journey Jan 27th 2022, weighing at 293 pounds, 5""11, with a BMI of 40.9. 

I intake a maximum of 2800 calories.
It usually ranges from 2300-2800, very few days are less than 2300 so far.
I eat whole wheat brown rice with Quinoa, whole wheat grain bread and have fruits for carbs.
I include eggs, mozarella cheese, very little red meat( for breakfast) and chicken breast daily in my diet. For the most part, vegetables are in my meals atleast once a day. Drinking Water only ( very few times I drank some Prime Hydration which only consists of 20-25 calories per bottle.)

As for exercise, for my first month I am only doing cardio. I do HIIT, for 20-24 minutes on the elliptical machine. 1 minute of high resistance (15) fast paced, then 3 minutes of low resistance (3) quick paced and I sweat bullets with my heart rate continously up.


I checked my weight yesterday Feb 25th 2022, and hooray! I weighed 278. Today is my cheat day and I will be eating whatever the hell I want (at a caloric restriction), and wont check the scale untill after another month. I will change my workout routine to 30 minutes of HIIT for 4-5 days a week and I will include 3 days of weight training. I know the weight loss isn't much to many, but for me that's a ton.
Hoping to weigh 265 pounds by mid April!

Some background info, I (30F) struggled with back problems for the past 8 years. In those years there were ups and downs, times where I felt okay enough to hit the gym and actually be proud of what my body could do and times where just getting out of bed in the morning was unthinkable.

Last August things took a really ugly turn and I ended up shoving so much medicine down my throat that I ended up gaining 20kg (44lb / 3.14st) in just a little over 2months.

I have finally had my much needed back surgery 1 month ago and what is a very happy happy moment is also turning into a scary one.

I am now 79kg (174lb / 1st) and I am 167cm (5.5ft) and looking in the mirror is getting more and more difficult everyday, its the heavier I've ever been in my life and this much extra weight is also making my surgical recovery harder.

I guess I just needed to vent and to share with people that might understand how I am feeling right now, since everyone around me either is of the opinion I will ""snap back"" into shape with no effort or that I immediately have to start a very strick diet to make sure I don't put on even more weight.

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why you‚Äôre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

For years I was eating close to 1600-2000 calories a day, always trying to lose weight and it wasn‚Äôt working so I said fuck it back in September of last year and raised my calories to roughly 3000. Since then, I‚Äôve gone from 200 to 230 which already seems excessive considering every online calculator says I should be at 3200 for maintenance. Now since last month I‚Äôve gone back to my usual diet and started dropping again. 

I also eat the exact same thing without issue everyday, which usually includes the following:

Protein shake and protein bar for breakfast: (500ish calories)

Spinach salad with chicken (~600-700 calories max) or chipotle bowl (~1000 cal) or poke bowl (~1000 cal)

For dinner I have 4 eggs, two pieces of Dave‚Äôs killer toast, and 4 pieces of bacon with oat milk (another 800-1000 calories).

Been fluctuating with my weight a lot, I would do crash diets and lose weight but gained back because it wasn‚Äôt sustainable, never exercised much, but this year I decided to change my lifestyle!

Have so far lost 1kg in the past month, definitely slow but at least steady and sustainable! Excited to lose even more in the coming months!

What I've been doing so far:

* mix of 1hour cardio (low to moderate intensity walk/jog) or 30mins dumbbells/strength training exercises (5-6 days a week)
* around 1500 kcal per day (according to TDEE calc, my maintenance is 1700kcal) - i'm also watching my macros (C:P:F 40:30:30) and try to eat as much veggies as I could!
* EDIT: i also have one cheat meal every week!

I would spend more time on exercising, but I don't have much free time currently. Will be graduating in May so maybe then I will take some time off to focus more on exercising!

But please feel free to let me know if you have any suggestion on anything that I could improve on!

Will be updating by the end of the year! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

t29os4,"After achieving my weight goal, I‚Äôm now afraid I‚Äôm losing more than intended",Vent/Rant,2,0.62,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t29os4/after_achieving_my_weight_goal_im_now_afraid_im/,8,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but it‚Äôs about weight loss, so I thought maybe I could hear other people‚Äôs opinions on this and that I could get some advice.

I‚Äôm 23 years old, female, 5‚Äô6. Currently 120 pounds (54.5 kg) When I was little, I was regarded as skinny by others. But when I hit my teenage years, I gained weight, and I was nowhere near overweight, but I was not ‚Äúskinny‚Äù anymore. I was just normal weight.

Being skinny had been placed in my head as being this ideal, that you‚Äôre attractive if you‚Äôre skinny. I know it‚Äôs wrong, like even I myself find people who are not skinny attractive, but I couldn‚Äôt think of myself as attractive unless I was skinny. This was around the time where I started to get very insecure about my thighs. I have a pear body shape and so I always gained weight around my thighs. When I used to see girls with thin legs, I used to always be jealous and wish mine were like that. It took me a long time to understand that my legs would never look like that, didn‚Äôt matter how much weight I lost, due to my body type.

When I was around 17-20, I started gaining a bit more weight. I reached about 147 (67.5 kg) pounds and that was my heaviest weight. And that is still in the normal weight range for someone of my height. However, seeing that I didn‚Äôt look like I did before and that my jeans were a little tighter on me made me really upset. I feared that I was going to keep gaining weight and be overweight.

I wanted to lose weight. I kept looking up pictures of models and KPOP idols, their weight and I wanted my body to look like that. I know it‚Äôs dangerous to idolize that, because most of them are underweight, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from thinking that they were beautiful and I could be too if I was around the same weight.

And so I made plan for myself to eat a little less and exercise a little more. And in about 4 months, I lost 26 pounds (12.5 kg). I didn‚Äôt starve myself and I think I lost it in a good amount of time (not too fast). My dream goal was to be around 122-127 pounds and I had finally achieved it.

And here is where my anxiety started. Here I was, with finally the ‚Äúthin‚Äù body I had always wanted since my teenage years. I did not want to lose anymore weight. So I slowly started to eat more and I cut back on my exercise.

But my weight loss hasn‚Äôt stopped. It‚Äôs been about two weeks since I stopped trying to lose weight and started eating normally (no calorie deficit) and I still lost 1.5 pounds. And I know that‚Äôs not a lot but it is scaring me. If I lose 5.5 more pounds (2.5 kg) I will end up underweight. I‚Äôm extremely anxious I will continue to lose weight. I was worried I would immediately gain back the weight I lost if I stopped eating in a calorie deficit but the opposite happened.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm exercising less and eating more. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. I don‚Äôt know how I am supposed to strike a balance anymore. 

‚ÄúAm I eating too little? Am I supposed to eat more? Should I be eating a snack even if I‚Äôm not hungry? Will I lose weight if I don‚Äôt? What if I start to eat too much, more than I intended and immediately start to gain weight back?‚Äù

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about all of these questions for the past two weeks. Every day, around meal time, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to. None of my jeans fit me anymore, and I keep thinking that if I buy new jeans - what‚Äôll happen if I gain weight and won‚Äôt be able to fit into them, or that I‚Äôll lose more and they‚Äôll be loose again.

I‚Äôm simultaneously scared of gaining back the weight I lost and losing more weight unintentionally and ending up underweight. I‚Äôm finally around the weight range I‚Äôve wanted all my life but I‚Äôm scared. 

I‚Äôm happy with my body now, this is not what this is about. But I‚Äôm scared and very anxious of unwanted change.",1645916837.0

The nurse was nice and asked if I wanted medication or if I wanted a dietitian, and I said, I would like to try a dietitian so I can learn more and ask questions when I get confused. She put in a referral and I'm going to see her on Tuesday.

Part of me felt shame for admitting that I need more help or direction than the wealth that's online. The other part of me says that even just having a third party that'd educated telling me that I'm doing the right things or that I need to refocus here or work on this will be so helpful to me.

TLDR: I've given up on trying to grind thru this weight loss period and am working on giving in to the idea I need some help.

Anyone who has seen a dietitian that can provide helpful advice? (Please no negative, I am trying to keep my already shameful thinking open).",1645823428.0

t19huu,SV: No longer obese,-,67,0.98,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t19huu/sv_no_longer_obese/,6,"As of today's weigh-in, i am no longer obese (according to BMI). I started this journey in May of 2020 at 300 pounds (male, 5-fee 8-inches). 

Today I am 196. I'm roughly 36 pounds away from my healthy weight range... so now just overweight.

I don't just use BMI, i also keep track of my waist circumference (36-inches) which i think i was around 54-57-inches when i  started. 

No tricks, no diets (i mean i've been a strict vegetarian for most of my life, since i was a teenager). i just did this by making a few small changes:

1. started looking at serving sizes, bought a food scale (i love my food scale)
2. started exercising. That started as walking 20 minutes a day. Now i do 3-days a week of functional strength training for an hour, and i run 3 miles 4-5 times a week. No gym, no memberships, no gear outside of the 30-pound dumbbell i bought. 
3. track calories and exercise (MyNetDiary), chart my progress (google sheets)

When i want french fries for dinner, i have them. just break out the food scale, crank up the air fryer. i make my own pizza every Friday night. 

Yeah i do not eat out, nor do i get take out or delivery. i cook/prep every meal, every day. 

I drink lots of water, and track it as carefully as i do my calorie intake (i use the app called MyNetDiary for everything). 

Being over 100 pounds lighter actually feels ""weird"" in a good way. My brain hasn't remapped my body really well I must say. It still ""thinks"" of me as a 300 pound-er. I bought a full-length mirror to help with that. 

I never thought I would be a person who can do 100 push-ups in a workout, then a couple hours later run for 3 miles. I'm 48 years old, and I'm in the absolute best physical shape i've ever been in. 

Over the course of this journey, which is not yet over, I have had to buy a lot of clothes. I used to wear 3XL t-shirts. Larges are a bit too big now. I'll be in mediums in a month or so. I used to wear size 48 trousers. 32 now. 

Losing  34% of my body mass, to me, is just. well, i don't know if anyone else feels this, but i'm going to try to articulate it. 

At this point in the game it's really nothing. Honestly, nearly two years into this journey the bus just pretty much drives itself. I don't really struggle with snacking or cravings any more. Which isn't to say this has been easy. It never is i don't think. 

Yeah i'm proud, i suppose, which is probably what is driving me to make this post. But at the same time, i knew this time would come, and i just kind of feel, ""well ok then, cool, but uh, yeah this doesn't feel big."" 

I thought, that when i made it to ""onderland"" that i would feel like celebrating that. But now that I am here, and reaching my healthy weight is just a function of a short amount of time, i just don't feel like it. At all. 

Is that weird?",1645810242.0

I have worked so freaking hard, and for what? For my body to look like a melted mess of skin, fat and stretch marks? For my stomach to sag with loose skin and left-over fat like a disgusting apron? For my boobs, which I used carry with pride, to deflate into flabby, empty, sad sacks of skin that I need to fold and roll into my bra? For my thighs and arms to turn into jiggly dough I can stretch with both hands? If I had known from the start this was to be my new body, I honestly would have rather stayed obese. 
This isn't what I wanted. This isn't what I worked for. I feel betrayed. 

Hi. If you've read this far into my little breakdown vent, let me tell you some background info about myself and my journey.
I'm a 25-year-old, 163 cm (~5'3) woman, who at her heaviest weighed 102 kgs (224 lbs), which means back in the day I was very obese according to BMI. I started my weight loss journey in 2019, and as of today I have lost 37 kgs (81 lbs) in total. The first ~20 kgs (~44 lbs) I lost during my first year or so. 
After that I maintained, then gained some and lost some for over a year because of personal life changes, eating disorder recovery attempts, covid and on-and-off gym habits. During the summer of 2021 I picked up calorie counting again and have since then lost another 10 kgs (22 lbs). 
I now weigh 65 kgs (143 lbs) and for the first time since childhood, I am now sitting inside the normal BMI weight range (albeit, still on the high end of the range). 

This journey hasn't been easy on my mental health and throughout it I have struggled a lot with my body image. (And developing EDNOS mid-way hasn't helped at all, but that's a story for another time. Let's just say calorie counting can do funny things to your brain...) But now my self-image has gotten so bad it's seriously affecting my every-day life. For example, I dread showering since it means I have to strip naked and see and feel my body. 

I feel so tired. How am I supposed to feel at home in a body I despise this much? At this point I have zero self-esteem left. I can't even be intimate with my boyfriend anymore because I feel so insecure about my loose skin, boobs (or more like the lack of them) and my body in general. I feel like a monster. I honestly don't even want to go outside anymore. I dress in the same baggy clothes every single day in attempts to hiding my body from the world and myself. 

I just... really thought losing weight would help me feel better about myself? Make me feel more confident and healthy and more... Content? It feels like it did the exact opposite, I hate my body now more than ever. A 25-year-old body isn't supposed look like this. I feel like a deformed monster. 

The things is, I feel like I have done everything by the book; taking good care of my skin, drinking 3 liters of water a day, trying to eat a lot of protein, nutrient dense foods and healthy fats, taking vitamins and collagen, exercising and trying to build muscle, maintaining my weight for a while, losing weight slowly... What else is there to do? It's been three years since I started after all! I suppose I just got really unlucky with my genetics, and I just have to accept that this will be my body for the rest of my life? 
Of course, the last, and probably the only option, would be to get surgery. The problem is I wouldn't even be able to afford it for another 10+ years. So surgery isn't really an option, at least not in near future. 

I feel trapped, depressed and defeated. I'm stuck in a constant state of being scared of gaining the weight back, but also being scared of continuing to lose weight (which would mean even more loose skin), and all at the same time feeling extremely unhappy and anxious in my current body. Every day feels like a struggle. I just don't know what to do. This isn't living anymore. 

I'm sorry for the lengthy vent. All of this is probably way above Reddit's pay grade, but I just needed a place to get this out. Maybe someone out there can relate. 

(PS. I do go to therapy, have been going for years, but unfortunately it hasn't really helped me with my body image issues.)

((PPS. First time posting, and I'm on mobile. I hope the formatting is alright and not super wonky))

t1in0m,'cheat day' getting better,,15,0.93,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t1in0m/cheat_day_getting_better/,7,"usually on friday night after work, i pig out.  i let myself get pretty much whatever i want and can eat in one night.  the rest of the week i'm pretty good with food.  i don't buy any junk when i go grocery shopping and only eat the mostly healthy food i buy from this weekly shopping visit.

to be clear, i don't think pigging out like this even once a week is conducive for weight loss, i've just become very attached to over-eating and it's still something i need to realize i don't enjoy the way i used to (thank god).  in reality, it doesn't really do much for me and i'm getting closer and closer to being a 'normal' person who's satisfied with something like a single donut as a treat after work on friday instead of eating half a dozen.  good news is, i seem to be making progress in this regard.  

as evidence of this progress, today i was doing my junk food run coming home from work and stopped at a store where i haven't shopped for months.  i was there to pick up ice cream (two containers of ben and jerry's is way too much ice cream to eat in one night but still about half as much ice cream as a full tub) and went to see if these donuts i used to buy were still there.  i was looking for them as i'd remembered them: a moderate assortment.  i wasn't seeing them and when i finally did i was shocked.  they were not a moderate assortment, the package of them was enormous!  i was stunned that i used to eat all of them plus, like, a pizza or something on my cheat day.  

i still have to work on the idea of a small amount of junk being enough and how i don't need something way over the top to be treated and satisfied.  i'm confident i can get there.",1645834232.0

The thing that bothers me is that she doesn‚Äôt even seem to register it as a problem. She is afraid to go to the doctor because she thinks the doctor will just dismiss her issues and tell her to lose weight. Like that‚Äôs not a valid concern. She‚Äôs 380 plus pounds and doesn‚Äôt even seem to know it‚Äôs an issue. She doesn‚Äôt even pretend to care. 

I used to be 350 pounds, and I‚Äôm still losing weight. I know it‚Äôs probably a pointless venture and would just ruin the friendship, because when I was at my worst, I didn‚Äôt think there was anything I could do either. I was convinced I was fine when I clearly wasn‚Äôt. People enabled me, and I feel like I‚Äôm just enabling her now. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything I can say that can actually flip that switch in her head like it switched for me. 

I suspect she‚Äôs one of those people who believe that weight loss is impossible or is secretly a HAES person, when I started losing weight, she practically accused me of having an eating disorder because I stopped eating snacks constantly and do OMAD. She does subtly seem to think there is something wrong with me for losing weight, which I think is even more baffling because her mother is an ex-fat. She sees it can be done and the habits her mother had to lose weight but it didn‚Äôt rub off on her at all or even make her consider losing weight for a second. 

She has health issues from being obese, but not any I guess big issues? she has pretty labored breathing at all times, even when sitting and not moving. She can‚Äôt walk long distances. She has insomnia and a terrible time sleeping, which I suspect might be related to sleep apnea. The typical back and knee pain. 

She clearly has issues from being morbidly obese but dismisses any concept that either exercising or a better diet could improve her health. 

I worry about what‚Äôs going to happen in a few years, me and her are in our twenties now so maybe that protects against major health issues, but that doesn‚Äôt last forever. I feel like once you get past a certain point, you either decide to lose weight, or you just keep gaining and gaining and gaining. 

She doesn‚Äôt really seem to respect me because of my past mental health issues so that‚Äôs another issue in it. If I do say something, I don‚Äôt want to come off as this judgmental bitch who‚Äôs only doing it to show off that I‚Äôm better or something.

 I know the futility in telling someone who doesn‚Äôt want to change that they should change, but I can‚Äôt help feel like I‚Äôm just assisting in digging her grave if I don‚Äôt.

Edit : WOW this got a lot more responses than I would have thought considering I posted it at 4 in the morning. I really do appreciate the advice and I read all the comments but didn‚Äôt respond because there are so many. I‚Äôve decided not to bring it up to her, and when it warms up, I‚Äôm going to invite her on walks and to go hiking, which she will most likely accept because we have done it in the past.",1645788274.0

But my husband has lost ~15 lbs since his high weight at the end of the summer, partly due to two nasty stomach bugs with COVID sandwiched in the middle. But he's also started on a moderate dose of Vyvanse which does help curb his appetite AND helps him focus with his ADHD, bonus!

[This comparison picture was made by u/brbgottagofast. ](https://imgur.com/a/9nSVLcA)

Weigh all of your food. Your measuring cups are adding calories. The serving size in grams is correct but how many pieces/slices that equates to on the package is probably not. Even the slices of ham that say two slices equals 39 calories each. Or 8 M&Ms equals X amount of calories. If you don't think companies are happily abusing their margin of error so they don't look as bad you're mistaken. 

I was completely unaware of this and I had only been measuring anything that I would guesstimate before owning a food scale. Now I know it's not just the milk and the cereal that I need to be wary of.

And then having to be that one fat girl giving a whole like of clothes that didn't fit to the fitting room attendant. Or walking in to a store, realizing they don't have anything in my size, having to leave immediately, and then feeling like everyone is staring at me like ""why did she even bother coming in?""

Well...I'm sure most of you get it.

But yesterday! Yesterday, I walked into a store (Garage, which is very, very much a ""skinny girl"" store), grabbed a bunch of things I liked, tried them on, and they fit!! Like! Holy shit!! THEY FIT!!! I've had luck fitting into some of their stretchier shirts even when I was at my heaviest, but these were things I would have NEVER even considered trying on before--fun, sexy things that just don't really come in bigger sizes. I tried on this one satin dress in an XL, and then tried it on in a large, and I BOUGHT THE LARGE!! It's a big too snug right now, but I could still zipper it and everything--I want it to be my dress for my 21st birthday in May. And I bought this one bra-type shirt in a large, and I'm going to order it in a medium too so that I know I'll be able to wear it on a trip with my best friend in June.

I tried on a few other things and didn't have the money to buy all of it, but it ALL fit!! Every single thing I brought into the fitting room fit, and looked good. I never, ever thought that would happen to me. 

This post is already too long, I'm just really happy. Thank you for reading the whole thing!",1645768930.0

6‚Äô2 male, mid 30‚Äôs. Goal is to go from 251 to 225 by mid April and reevaluate. May switch more to moderate muscle gain, may keep dropping weight, go to 215 or 210. Started mid January to watch what I was eating (just, at all, covid had given me free license to the cupboards at all times, day or night). Was sick of feeling like I looked like a balloon and scoring my highest score on the scale for all time (251 and change). Our family joined an extended family invitation to cut out as much added sugar as possible in February, but I‚Äôve taken that several steps further:

1) started exercising again in some way most days, between swimming a mile at least twice a week, walking a mile two or three times a week, occasional sprints (damn them), rowing machine, and yoga.

2) downloaded MyFitnessPal and use the calorie counting feature near-religiously. Striving to keep myself at the goal numbers for proteins, fats, and carbs, but man can that be a challenge! Still haven‚Äôt hit the protein goal perfectly, but my fat, carbs, and sugar consumption has dropped significantly. Eating more fruit, way more veggies, and trying to make more lean meats fit in my family budget. The best protein ain‚Äôt cheap, but I keep telling myself neither are the legion illnesses associated with obesity. Trying to ‚Äúchoose my hard‚Äù. Side note, using Happy Scale (iOS) to track weight because it has a moving average for ‚Äútrue‚Äù weight. 

3) went to about 6 or 7 calorie calculators to get an average for what my body needs, then cut that number by about 15-20% daily, will likely bring that back up to a less aggressive 10% mid March. Don‚Äôt want to risk losing any/much muscle. 

4) sleeping way earlier, getting around 7-7.5 hours per night, far better than what I‚Äôve done in the past.

5) trying to stay well hydrated, but finding that a challenge sometimes. I get acid reflux if I drink or eat too much too often. It‚Äôs a tightrope but I‚Äôm getting better at that.  

The end result so far is today‚Äôs weight came in at 236.4, and I am incredibly excited about that! Really could not appreciate this group of people more. You‚Äôve all been an inspiration and a support with your posts and comments.

Keep Counting and Carry On.",1645803564.0
t1phzd,I need some help for weight loss.,Question,2,0.67,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/t1phzd/i_need_some_help_for_weight_loss/,2,"I am 26 yrs/ Female. My height is 153 cms 
Weight is 69 kgs or 152 pounds
But my waist to hip ratio is 0.75
My waist is 31.5 cms whereas my hip is 42 cms.
I can lose weight on my own but after I lose it, I lose loads of hair as well so much so that it affects my mental health.
I consulted with a dietician recently. She has recommended not to restrict any particular food other than junk food and put me on -500 calorie diet. My protein requirement being 64 gms according to her.
I have to mention I also have hypothyroidism as well. And very bad anxiety disorder for which I have to take clonazepam 0.25 sometimes. 
I am just scared that I might lose hair again. Has anybody had any kind of experience of registered dietician? I am asking because I tend to overthink and because of my past bad experiences with weight loss.",1645854426.0

I do a 30 minute spin bike workout three times a week and I am aiming to get to 10k steps a day but is this enough? 

I have arthritis which affects major joints like knees, hips, wrists etc so I don‚Äôt want to start weights until I consult my physiotherapist, although they have started me on stretching. 

I am currently hitting MFPs protein goal of 75g most days and I‚Äôm eating between 1300 to 1500 calories as having a set deficit rather than a range messes with my head. Am I getting enough protein? 

I just don‚Äôt want to lose what muscle I have whilst I lose weight. In a month or two after I see my physiotherapist I will start incorporating weights into my regime.",1645867125.0
t1mksx,When is the ‚Äúlose weight slowly‚Äù phase. I feel like I started very large (max weight for me at 170 pounds) so I figured I‚Äôd lose it fast. My coworker who is larger than me would lose 6-7 pounds in few weeks. Mine has been slow.

I‚Äôve lost 5-7 pounds in a few months (while building muscle so likely more fat loss). But disappointed it‚Äôs not as big of a loss as others. I realize that at like 120 pounds, losing 1 pound takes a long time. But where‚Äôs the cut off? At 160s pound is it slow? 150?140? Should I cut down my expectations? What‚Äôs a reasonable weight loss rate (while building muscle) in this weight category. 

Would appreciate others experience :)",1645845356.0
