t78t2y,Advice...,,3,0.71,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/t78t2y/advice/,4,"Hey! Okay so I figured the gaming sub would be a good place to ask for advice. I am in the market for a new laptop and I really want one that can handle gaming (I've been made aware that desktops for gaming are ""the way to go"" but I just don't like being stationary). I'm also not a ""gamer"" gamer if that makes sense. I play games, and I like them, but I don't need my computer to power NASA either.

Basically, what are your suggestions for an affordable ""gaming"" laptop? I've done some independent research and I'm in the peer review stage lol I understand I won't be getting a Dell from Walmart for 200$ but I would like to keep it at a reasonable price.

Thank you so much in advance! I really appreciate any suggestions!

Edit: Thought I should add for reference, I currently have a MacBook which has been fine so far for my needs but it's starting to die and rather than buy another MacBook just for the sake of keeping my devices linked I thought I would branch out possibly. I've looked into Razer and Alienware...

Second edit: I'd like to stay under $2,000 if possible. ",1646484645.0

t6z0i6,A belated review of Bioshock Infinite,,12,0.81,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/t6z0i6/a_belated_review_of_bioshock_infinite/,3,"Disclaimer: I have only played Bioshock 1 and Bioshock Infinite, and I already knew the ending of Infinite before starting (the game's too old, too popular).

I tried playing this game back in 2013, but life circumstances got in the way. Almost 10 years later I finally got around to playing both the original Bioshock last year, and now the sequel Ken Levine also directed. To my dismay, what I feared most ended up happening. I really enjoyed the original because of it's eerie atmosphere, its claustrophobic setting, and its gritty art style; I particularly liked the Big Daddy encounters, and think those truly elevated the experience. Plasmids and hacked turrets were very fun to use, and the story was solid.

Going into Infinite I knew many of those aspects would be absent, but I hoped they might be replaced by other different, stranger ideas. However, despite knowing the whole game consisted of an escort mission, I wasn't expecting such a lazy way to justify it. My biggest problem with this game is easily how, in the context of the story, most of the actions you and the enemies perform make little sense. Elizabeth is an invincible companion that both the Columbian law enforcement and the Vox Populi completely ignore, they don't attack her, they don't engage with her, and although she is the very reason why everyone wants to kill Booker, no one ever attempts to kidnap or restrain her in-game. It's a pervading issue that really prevented me from becoming immersed in the story the game wanted to tell me.

Her presence also creates a time-sensitive agenda for how events unfold, and introduces a sense of urgency to your actions that goes completely against the gameplay mechanics of the original Bioshock. Yes, you can play Infinite the same way you play the original, but in the context of the story it makes no sense for Booker to waste so much time exploring Columbia, taking in the views and upturning every piece of furniture he comes across. I treated Infinite the same way I treated the original up until the point where you arrive at Emporia, where the game locks you from backtracking to previous areas completely, and it makes it plainly obvious you're now playing an action game à la Call of Duty (not dissing CoD by the way, that series is fine).

Even knowing about the twist ending didn't help make the rest of the story any more coherent. Once Elizabeth started opening tears to parallel dimensions, all bets were off and the story really took a hit for me. I couldn't take seriously how Booker so nonchalantly abandoned his own reality to pursue objectives that couldn't have existed in a parallel world. Giving guns to the Vox Populi in exchange for an airship was a deal Booker made with Daisy Fitzroy 2 dimensions back, so... why are we joining a revolution now?

Besides all that, yes the guns are fun to use (the non-red ones at least), yes Vigors are fun although they make little sense within the story, and yes Columbia is an entertaining locale to explore, despite being inferior to Rapture. I don't know man, I can't say Infinite is bad, it certainly isn't, it's just that shit gets so wild I feel like the plot becomes all scrambled; it's about racism, then about revolution, then parallel worlds, and then doomsday? What? It feels like I'm walking into Disneyland, then Les Miserables, and I somehow end up becoming my own grandpa. In other words 8/10. That last bit was a joke.",1646446223.0

I'm getting older and I am in this crazy stage of life where I now have a 10 year old daughter that is actually interested in playing games with me!  We do all kinds of stuff together already (outdoors stuff, woodworking, and games like Ticket to Ride) but I am loving the fact that she is interested in video games too because I have loved games since I was a kid with my PS1.  

Anyway...  I am having a lot of trouble finding games for us to play...  So, I am hoping for some help.  I am looking for things that meet this criteria if possible (I am currently an Xbox guy BTW).

1) Couch Co-op - Something that we can actually sit next to each other and play!  I don't understand why so many devs have completely moved away from this...  There are so many games that could have this feature and it simply isn't included...  I really don't want to buy another Xbox/TV for her just so that we can play something together!  

2) Kid Friendly - This one probably goes without saying, but saying it anyway...  My daughter is ten...  While I mind a little fun ""mischief"" in games, I don't want to expose her to Gears or Resident Evil...  

3) No witchcraft please - This one is kind of weird, but here it is...  Games have magic, spells, and stuff like that.  I get it and I am totally fine with it.  However, I feel like a lot of games are just going WAY over the top with demonic imagery and witchcraft.  It's crazy...  I recently picked a game for us to try off of Game Pass that looked like a possible option and we literally didn't even make it past the character selection screen before they blasted a giant pentagram on the screen.  I'm not looking to expose her to that.

My gamecube controller which came with my original gamecube back in 2002 still works 100% today. It was the console I played the most and it was the controller I used the most since our only other gamecube controllers for multiplayer were crappy 3rd party ones. As a young kid I was bound to be rough with it. One time after getting chocolate stains on it, being the stupid young kid I was, I washed it under the tap which caused the controller to rumble non stop for months before somehow fixing itself. Its not even a case where the rumble pack burned out. It just rumbles when its supposed to now and its been the case for the last decade. After digging it out from under the bed for some Smash Bros Ultimate with my new adapter, the only issue was a slightly sticky R button. I opened it up (rather easily too, another problem with new controllers), cleaned this with a q tip and it works perfectly again.

Now for my other example, my Xbox One controllers. When I bought the Xbox One, I wasn't much of a gamer anymore. I had college and then work commitments. I bought 4 controllers for it and no longer being a kid, I was careful with all electronics. Despite barely playing that thing in 6 years and I really mean barely, two of the controllers ended up with faults despite their cases being spotless and scratch free from lack of use. One had really bad drift and the other one, the LB and 2 d-pad buttons were no longer working. I opened them up (which was quite hard) and attempted to fix them but no dice. Microsoft are not the only offenders of course. Sony and even the once reliable Nintendo are just as bad.

I'll drop the caveat though, actions speak louder than words and a ton of games sell well of the hype, BF2042 is presently the prime example, haha; so, I see the downside too. But, overall, I think this would be a huge step advancing the interactive media marketplace; I believe people would buy more games than they would have if given a taste of what they are; I mean they would be halfway in the door with an unlimited access timed trial, people would get a few hours deep and certain psychology would come into affect, they would make sales off people that want to finish what they started and I think it would make games come out in more complete states; if cyberpunk had a trial or demo, would anyone have bought it, so, there's likely more reasons not to have demos and trials.

I’m just looking for recommendations on fun games similar to those above

Some things:

-I would say it should be released sooner than like 2005. I tried to play Morrowind and the first 2 Fallouts but the graphics for me were just too bad to ignore.

-Anything that has branching dialogue that impacts the world like Fallout New Vegas and the Witcher is ideal
-Open World is definitely more fun

-I love Westerns more than anything but im not sure if there are any like the Red Dead series or Fallout New Vegas

I’ve thought about the Assassins Creed series and might get one but i’ve also read that the gameplay mechanics are nothing like the games above.

And this post is inspired by the game Elder Ring. I bought it and wow it was not for me. It was way too hard and what is a fantasy game worth if there are no quaint towns to explore?

Oh and also a prefer a game that’s not so complicated. The 4 games I put in my title are ones that are pretty simple to me

I started it yesterday and already finished it. Took me like 5 hours. Felt more like a dlc than an actual game. The gun play was fun and such but the game was insanely short. For $50 I would’ve wanted more

When I defeated the final boss I thought the game would continue but instead I saw the credits and couldn’t play anymore 
Gameplay: 9/10 fun and fast paced like doom but feels a little off sometimes

Story/characters: 6/10 it’s a story and the characters aren’t fleshed out at all. Barely any “development”

Graphics: 9/10 somewhat cartoony but good

Character animations and voice acting: 4/10 the animations feel stiff and not well done tbh

Game duration: 3/10 feels extremely short especially for a $50 game. Felt more like a dlc than a standalone game. Took me 6 hours and I wasn’t a pro and I died like 11 times 

Overall: 6.2/10
Really held back by the game duration. Wouldn’t suggest it for $50 if you want a whole game.",1646451588.0

And I get it, Souls games are inherently designed to be difficult and challenging and Souls fans are proud of this. I can understand why the idea of Souls games having an easier setting is widely mocked

But I haven’t seen anyone discuss another aspect to this debate, that regarding disabled gamers who might want to play Souls but can’t because the game is too difficult for them to physically keep up with. A lot of the arguments in favor of an easy mode are actually talking about a more accessible version of Souls for disabled gamers to enjoy.

What do y’all think about this? Should there be an accessible version for the disabled, or should the disabled just tough it out like everyone else?",1646405827.0

I was in the jungle when my screen started to tear, so I enabled Vsync very hesitantly. My refresh rate is 60hz. Literally immediately, I was getting at least 60fps but it was solid so I knew it was more.

I was able to change everything back to high settings, and textures to medium, and the game works wonderfully. (55-60fps) The scaling is now at ultra and the resolution is 1080p. How could this even happen? Vsync is supposed to hurt your game's fps, right?",1646432909.0

Imagine a Duke game that plays like Doom 2016/Eternal, but with aliens instead of demons. 

A reboot of the series with a reimagined Duke  with a more serious story. Maybe his son takes the role?  Or we could just reboot Duke Nukem 1 with the evil scientist plot. But onto the pitch, 

A first person shooter where Duke can upgrade his skills, dual wield pistols or rifles, have viable builds like strength focused where he can perform executions (the stronger the more bloody) and literally destroy walls or a more agile build allowing him to scale walls and do kicks off enemies, I want the engine to render his fist being shoved into the enemies face. Duke should have extra weapons like a grappling hook to latch onto enemies or shoot them in the face with it. 

He can be a badass and make quips, but he needs to evolve and leave the 90s dated humor behind. The game needs to focus on just how awesome and tough Duke is, 

He should be making aliens scared and be fearless, he needs to be more doom guy and not constantly making jokes. His 3D counterpart was funny but also scary. 

We need a Duke that isn't a total douche and doesn't get blowjobs from strange men via gloryholes (forever), of course there should be babes, but they shouldn't be the focus. The game should focus more on his badassery then ego and sexualness. 

I know he's a 90s mascot, but if Gearbox (or whoever owns the rights) just makes him more likable and tough like he used to be (not cringy or douchy), we could forget all about Forever. 

 After all, we forgot about Doom 3.",1646440811.0

t76mhq,Is Elden Ring worth it?,,0,0.21,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/t76mhq/is_elden_ring_worth_it/,19,"I've heard a lot about this game recently, but I'm still on the fence about it and was hoping you fine internet strangers that have actually played the game can clear up a few details for me. As much as I love gaming, $60 is still a big purchase and I'd like to know I'll be getting my money's worth, or if this game's just not what I'm looking for.

First off, is the game *really* ""open world""? I've been hearing conflicting reports across the net. When I hear the term ""open world"", my mind goes to Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Witcher, etc. A large map that has quests scattered across it, and you're free to go in any direction you want. You can join whatever faction, you can complete or ignore whatever mission, including the main storyline, and still get lost in hours of gameplay. An open world. Soulsborne games, while possessing impressive level designs with occasional branching pathways, felt more ""labyrinthine"" to me. Even if the level has a few different paths, there's inevitably only one direction you can go in to drive the game forward. Don't get me wrong, this formula works for FromSoftware's games, I just want to know what I'm signing up for. From what little gameplay I've seen, it reminds me of Shadow of Colossus, where there's a large open area you can traverse, but there's nothing really to do out there. The important stuff happens in smaller areas that you have to push forward to get through. I've heard people compare it to ""Breath of the Wild"", but I never played that one.

Secondly, how's the gameplay? I imagine it's standard Dark Souls mechanics, but I was just curious if anything was tweaked or added.

Thirdly, I'm running on PS4. How does the game handle on ""last-gen"" hardware?

Finally, and this is the big one, how much of a pain is co-op? I was excited at the idea of exploring this world with friends, but if the co-op is a hassle like Dark Souls and Bloodborne, then I don't see the point in playing with friends. I get that multiplayer is not a simple feature to add to a game, and it can ruin the gameplay if the rest of the game is tailored to a single-player experience, but like I said, this game looked like it would be fun to play with friends. Unfortunately, the last time I tried co-op was in Bloodborne. I was forced to burn very valuable, semi-rare Insight to play co-op, added to the fact we all had to be in relatively the same spot in the game (not the worst thing, but it added another step to an already frustrating process). Worst of all, even with a password, we would just get invaded by some level 300 naked jagweed that would near-instantaneously obliterate us before we were playing for even five minutes. Not to mention, as soon as one of us died, that was it for the co-op session, and we had to start from ground zero for all of us to play again. That means more Insight to burn, but we're all going to get smoked again, so what's the point of even trying? I get that these games are meant to be challenging, but for crying out loud, I just want to have a fun time online with friends, not get griefed. I don't have 50 hours every week to sink into this game to keep up with the griefers.

However, from what I've heard in Elden Ring you burn an in-game item for co-op, but it's easier to craft/collect than in previous games. Can anyone confirm this? Does only the host need to burn this item, or do joining players need to burn it too? If a player dies, does the session end? Are you bound to a specific area when you start a co-op game? Does only the host get XP/items/progress from the co-op session? is there a way to set up a private co-op game so you won't get invaded?",1646475750.0

GT7 they make you start with a music racing mini game for some reason? That was odd but ok. Then when you get to starting the main game the intro credits are obnoxious. And  into the open world it suffers a little from the JRPG problem with a little heavy on the text and going through menus. Some lady walking you through everything slowly. 

The cafe thing with the menus is annoying. Why do I have to go to some other screen just to get the challenges? One line of text between races would be fine. Bleh. ""Place top three in these three races"" doesn't need some cafe menu that takes itself too seriously. 

You don't get the tuning unlocked until after the third menu. 🙄. Man I just want to tune and race, calm down with the rest of it. 

They're heavy on the car collecting. Which seems odd. You have to up your car collection to unlock some things. But you win cars after most races so alright? 

The cars are beautiful. The tracks are great. The racing itself is top notch. Controls are fantastic. Despite having to go through so many screens the screen load times are quick.

The best improvement over the previous games is that the load screens are quick. You don't have to wait for ever to load a track for a race, and if you retry a challenge it's near instant restart. That's awesome. 

Overall the racing itself, the mechanics and feel and everything are fantastic. They could take themselves a little less serious and cut down on some of framework.",1646409846.0

First, some context. Every year I create a ""Birthday Book"" for my kids, where I photoshop them into an adventure themed around whatever they're into at the time.

When I do this, I use screenshots of game backgrounds. Here are two examples:

[https://imgur.com/a/iPZZswB](https://imgur.com/a/iPZZswB) (please don't judge my PS skills, they're beginner-to-intermediate level)

The top image was for my son's book in 2021. He's into Warhammer, and the photo is a combination of models my son and I have painted, screenshots of models from the GW website and the background is from the PC game Space Marine. This game was a bit of a pain, because I couldn't remove the HUD and the camera was tethered to the player character. I made it work though.

The bottom image was for my daughter's book last year. She's into Minecraft and LOTR (this particular story included her favourite teddy and her hamster, if you're wondering!). Minecraft is an amazing game for my needs because I can easily hide the HUD and use Creative Mode to fly, positioning the camera however I want.

Over the years I've used Arkham City, multiple Total War games and Space Hulk, as well as the games mentioned above.

For this year my son wants another 40k-themed book, but he wants it set in a forested area.

That's a very long-winded way of asking for games suggestions that have forest areas (I'd accept jungle, too) - if they have a way to hide the HUD, a ""photo-mode"" or free camera, that would be even better.

What are the chances they are setting up a Super Smash Bros movie. Giving us a movie for each pickable character from the N64 game before they all join forces to fight Mr Hand (Mr?). Anyways what do you guys think, or who would you cast for your favorite character, let me know in the comments",1646434699.0

For me, Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories. God damn I’d love a remaster of that to waste endless hours smashing the Meadow Mage for B.M. Dragon and Skull Knight.

Edit: lots of people mentioning Oblivion and Morrowind. I implore you to check out r/skyblivion and r/skywind respectively. These games are being lovingly remastered in the Skyrim engine by people who are doing it for fun!",1646389151.0
