Don't be annoyed by the 'get gud' tagline, yes it's pretentious but I promise you that you can overcome any challenge in these games.

Are their cheesy/cheeky enemy placements designed to surprise you? Yes. But when you know what to look for, they quickly become an easy encounter.

What I'm trying to say is, don't let your worries stop you from enjoying these amazing games. You genuinely are missing out on the most rewarding, intriguing games of the past decade.

You can do it. The games aren't even hard when you get used to the formula.

I absolutely destroyed him in our first match together. 

Over time me and him played together many times on the game and I've seen him grow. I'm not the best player, but I average having the highest points in the game, with him right behind me.

Unfortunately, after the DDOS attacks on Titanfall 2 my childhood game, we both stopped and it was really depressing since I planned on getting more of my younger relatives into it.
However, we decided to play again, but this time 1v1 against each other and it was great. We decided to use titans and loadouts that we never used or had little experience in and out of 8 matches he beaten me 6 times. 

So in our last 5 matches we decided to use our usual loadouts when we played and it was very interesting and fun because we both have almost identical playing styles. Even though I beaten him out of all 5 matches. He was always a few points behind me and has almost won a couple of games.
Anyways my bad for the long post, but I was proud of my little brother and consider him my equal in terms of skill and luck lol.

spkz91,"I'm about to play my favorite game (Fallout 4) for the first time in 5 years, and conquer one of the oldest symptoms of my OCD. Any ideas on how to get myself super hype?",3,0.8,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/spkz91/im_about_to_play_my_favorite_game_fallout_4_for/,4,"A few years ago on r/Fallout, I posted about how Fallout 4 was my favorite game of all time, and had saved my life, but my OCD had ruined the game for me and made me an anxious wreck when I tried to play it. It seemed to strike a chord with the sub because I stayed within like the top 5 posts on the sub for several weeks. A lot of people gave me a lot of support. Someone offered to send me an old computer of theirs incase having better graphics helped, someone even coded a mod for me they thought could help me. Sadly the nature of OCD is odd and nothing could fix it. The love I got from this community meant more than I could ever express to a slightly younger me who was in a real bad place and didn't have a lot of friends.

(Edit: for anyone curious the OCD issue I had was related to the fact that certain combos of weapons and armor would allow for you to see worn armor pieces to move in your FOV when you walked. As this was on of the my first very noticeable issues with OCD, I originally thought it was a bug and I was just noticing it. However it turns out it was just a tiny and sensible detail that my brain had only then noticed and decided to latch on to, and my obsession with it made me so anxious I could play the game comfortably. This issue has plagued me since I was about 13.)

But It's been 2 years or so now. And I've come a long way, and I've begun to overcome a lot of my struggles with OCD. Over the course of the last few months, I've introduced my younger sister to Skyrim. She's played Minecraft on her computer before, What Remains of Edith Finch on my PS4, and had 1v1ed me poorly in Call of Duty a couple times. This was all her gaming experience. She asked me for something ""like What Remains of Edith Finch"" so I did what any good big brother would do and I said ""no here's what you're really looking for"" and sat her down in front of Skyrim. Skyrim was probably my next most important childhood game beside Fallout 4, but for years I'd struggled to find the motivation to get past the first few hours. It was seeing my little sister playing that gave me that motivation again. Teaching her how to fight and about the lore and just generally helping her and being the ""big brother who knows this game like the back of his hand"" was amazing, and it made me want to play for myself. So I brought my PC downstairs and set it up at a desk in the same room as the PS4 my sister was playing at, and for the first time since I was probably 12 or 13, I started a new Skyrim game. I could chat with my sister about the game and guide her through things when she got stuck and it was a nice bonding thing. On my first playthrough in 4-5 years, I played a character to level 50 for the first time in all my 2000+ hours of play. I did all the DLC, I roleplayed and made choices like my character and I got into the game and did every side quest I could. It felt amazing. In this time my sister played one character (a good simple warrior) to level 38 and almost did everything the game has to offer and then played another character to level 45 (a stealth archer which I encouraged because I wanted her to learn more ""gaming skills"" and try something a bit harder) and almost finished everything in the game again. Like the kid almost 100%ed it. I've never even done that!!! The kid has really experienced a lot of what it means to ""play videogames"" if you know what I mean, and I'm proud of her and love her for learning so well (Edit: Oh my god I checked and it's been a YEAR since we first started. I cannot believe that.)

She finished her second playthrough about a week ago and I finished mine on Tuesday. As I mentioned I got her to play a stealth archer. This is to practice one essential skill... aiming. Right after she finished her first character I'd come up with an idea. I'd make this a thing I do with her. We'd play the games that meant most to me at the same time and we could do it with tons of other games. And I knew that was next had to be Fallout 4. I know that being with my little sister and having that reason to push through any bad feelings of boredom or anxiety will allow me to play and make the most out of Fallout 4 again. And as it's the only game more important than Skyrim, it'd be the next game.

My sister is extremely excited to play now, and has been getting more and more antsy to play it over the last few months. On Saturday, we are gonna wake up nice and early, do a bit of an ""opening ceremony"" with us and my friend (who lives with us and will be joining us this time but play Fallout New Vegas while we play 4.), and play all day and all night. It sounds corny but hey. It's bonding. I want her memories of us living together and her first memories of really getting into videogames to be good. It won't be long before I've moved out and videogames will be a slightly less new and exciting part of her life.

I was also feeling the excitement but then I just got a bit stressed and now I've got a cold!!!

So if you guys are still reading and wouldn't mind, 1st of all thank you for caring enough to read all of this story, and 2nd... what do you think are some ways to get myself really excited again. Bring me back to those ""Fallout 4 is new and fresh!!!"" days and feelings. I've thought about listening to some songs from the radio and sound track, and I've gone back and watched all the trailers. This has for sure done something for me, but I need something to really get me jumping with excitement. To get me out of my high stress post cold unable to get hyped mood. To make me excited to return to the Commonwealth, the a world I know like the back of my hand but haven't seen in nearly 5 years, but this time with my little sister, and in doing this, earning a victory of a mental illness that has almost ended my life, and has held so joy hostage from me for so long.

Any ideas are welcome. Thanks for reading!!!

TL;DR: What are some ideas to get excited for returning to Fallout 4, my favorite game, for the first time in half a decade.",1644538719.0

Hey everyone,
On Sunday night, after seeing a post on this subreddit made by u/rogu3granny - I made a case on EA‚Äôs help website titled:

Consumer rights act 2015: Digital Content

After 4/5 live chats and some extremely rude customer service (closing chats mid conversation, transferring etc..) I got through to a helpful agent. I stated my case on all 3 points:
- the product was not fit for purpose
- the product was not as described 
- the product was not to a satisfactory quality

I also made the point very clear there was now evidence online on this Reddit of a user stating this exact argument and getting a refund, along with the fact EA‚Äôs refund rules do not over ride the law in the country the game was sold in. (Sorry US folk)

After some back and forth, and please note I have only played 30 hours before packing this game in, after playing bf3/4 for hundreds of hours, I said the final: 

Game is poorly optimised. Unprepared for launch. Full of bugs. Doesn‚Äôt provide the additional content promised to gold edition

While the physical microphone is OFF, my computer is still detecting input from the wire. I verified this by unplugging the wire, and no longer getting input.

I'm using two lengths of cheap extension wire from the computer to my microphone, so the wire circles 1/4 of the room. If I unplug the physical microphone from the extensions, the input is just static, with no discernable sounds. But while fully plugged in, and physical microphone still OFF, I'm picking up a radio show. Something about Tom Brady and VR. Nothing being listened to in the house, that's for sure. 

My guess is that this cheap wire is acting as a sort of radio antennae a la Braceface.

Luckily, when I do turn on the physical microphone, the louder I turn the dial, the quieter the radio show gets, so it *shouldn't* interfere with what I'm doing. But how the heck would I fix this besides getting quality components? Wrap my wires in tinfoil to try and shield them?

I know this might be a stupid question because it totally relies on me being able to commit to something, but I figured I‚Äôd ask for some advice anyways.

I‚Äôm a pretty slow gamer. When I hear people beating a game within a week, I‚Äôm amazed. When I pick up a new game, I usually play it nonstop whenever I have the chance and then I just randomly stop playing for a day or two then never come back to it. It‚Äôs not even that I don‚Äôt like the games, cause I do. A lot of the games I do this with I was really enjoying.

I end up not playing the games for like a month. But when I actually do come back to the game, I feel weird picking it up in the middle cause I might have forgotten what was going on at the time. So I usually end up restarting the whole thing, but sometimes I feel off just restarting a game halfway through that I just played like a month ago, so I end up not picking it back up so I am able to justify restarting the whole thing in my head after having a longer period of time between.

I think there is something wrong with me lmao.

 I don't like lol because I find stressfull its movement system, about Valorant it's not like I totally dislike it, I mean, I dislike its csgo style shooting system but I could have beared with it if actually I had the chance to play: dying over and over the whole time. 

After the horrible experience I noticed how a decent matchmaking balancement is needed to actually have fun matches. It's not like a win or lose problem, I'm used to losts.

A week ago I had my lasts games at Valorant, I totally tilted, 2 hours spent in not playing, watching others playing, making someone else have fun and being meat cannon.

Now I always feel totally stressed, after I spend the whole day studying I'd like to play and have fun with friends but in Valorant I can't even play because of unfair matches where I can just walk around

From that day I don't manage to relax when I get some free time: I tried some For Honor but since when they changed mechanics it's quite difficult to me to do something, I tried Sniper Elite 4 and I do stupid mistakes over and over (in my first run I didn't have much problems playing it since beginning), I tried playing ironsight, it started decently but Yesterday i didn't manage to find a single lobby that could suit my level, etc. Whatever I do I always do stupid mistakes that doesn't let me play and enjoy.

I even wanted to try to play double dragon neogeo every time I die in Valorant (not playing it now, it's too early) and see if stress is minor like that but the current emulator crash whenever I switch window.

I have just few free time because of university and I only wanna have fun in free time, trying to get decent aim and study the game would be useless to me (plus, I already study enough and it's not fun studying to me). I won't be able to really improve decently, plus I find more fun learning on the battlefield instead of watching boring tutorials. I repeat, it's not about winning or losing, I prefer losing a match that I actually played then winning one in which I do nothing

You have any advice that could help me? (no ""git good"" and other toxic bullshits please)

This not only helps to people trying to switch to consoles, but also makes the whole gaming experience more entertaining and easier.

I‚Äôm new to console gaming. Never had one. I‚Äôve been avoiding consoles mostly because I got used to a mouse+keyboard set. Recently, I got myself my first Nintendo switch, Xbox and play station.
The first console game that I tried was Zelda: Breath of The Wild. I didn‚Äôt have to get used to it. Aiming with a bow felt so natural. Then I played Far Cry, Battlefield and Doom. I liked these games so much on PC, but hated playing them on the console. I finished Doom:Eternal to get used to a controller, btw. 
Then I played Days Gone.
I was so happy, and it was such a relief. The whole game you have to shoot, aim, and throw something. With gyroscope it was so natural and fun.
All I needed was a little adjustment with the gyroscope. I aim primarily with sticks, but finish with gyro.
Now, playing without it is kinda painful.

Adaptive triggers in dual sense and the whole vibration theme was not that fun for me like the gyroscope was.

No Time Crisis, No Pac Man, No TMNT, No Jurassic Park, No fast and the furious, No Street fighter, No Tekken, No initial D, No Daytona USA, No Wangan Midnight, No Big Buck Hunter, No alpine racer, No Star Wars, No 80s and 90s arcade classics, No Neo Geo, No Marvel Vs Capcom, No Crazy Taxi, No terminator, No MotoGP, No Outrun, No SF rush, No Lets go Island. I get that the place is primairly a sports bar for adults with arcade games at the side, but if you're going to have an ""arcade for adults"", at least make the games appealing to adults. Golfland and places like that have a much better arcade with the missing games previously mentioned there.",1644506751.0

Years and years ago, I used to play a Game, a web browser game as the Title of the Post says. I got weird nostalgia effect, and the game came to my mind out of nowhere but I cannot recall the name of it.

Things I remember about the game:

It was both F2P and P2W.

The Player had a City that could be renamed, upgraded and build different buildings in it.

In the City, player could produce a variety of units which he/she could use to raid other players or could send it to the AI. If the player sent it to the AI, the player could get units back from it, so like some sort of trade system, trash units for better ones.

The attacks the player did took an amount of time depending on the units the player sent, so for example, mounted troops took less time than melee. I do recall the game having dragons.

The game also allowed clans/alliances and said clan/alliances to takeover beacons so as to gain map influence and bonuses that came along. These beacons could also be defended with player troops.

The player could also siege other players so as to gain some sort of passive income from said enemies.

Players could also take their units and set them on their base as a sort of defense vs other players and hope to repell enemy forces. Players could also send their troops to other players as a form of defense so as to crush the enemy force.

Last thing I remember is that I belonged to a Clan/Alliance named Knights of Camelot (KOC for short). Pretty sure it had other sub clans, KOCII for example.

Edit 1:

It was not a Mobile Game.

Its art was not cartoonish/animeish.

Hope you guys can help me out,

Thanks :)",1644537920.0

I'd rather have the new Pok√©mon game, than the traditional mainline ones with amazing graphics. Why? The mainline series is dull, old, and doesn't innovate enough. The new game does. I can easily look past crappy graphics. 

Graphics do not matter. Too many games have an emphasis on graphics and not gameplay systems because graphics sell a game easier than complex or interesting gameplay. This has been made obvious with the thousand + ""Pok√©mon game look bad, game isn't that good"" posts on this sub. 

If the gameplay was worse, but the graphics were amazing, I'd be confident in saying people would be drooling over it and saying how amazing it was. 

This isn't to say good graphics can't add to a game, it can for sure, but for me 8/10 times I'll take the game with good gameplay over good graphics. Anyone remember ""The Order 1886""?

It's especially terrible when games lock game modes behind it. And in team games, games that choose the game mode randomly, or games with poor balancing and or netcode it can feel like your being punished for factors beyond your control. I've been told to ignore it but the games always make a point to show you your rank dropping to the point where it feels like an insult.

Now we wanted to experience some new and other games together. Do you guys have any suggestions?
We would like to play together (against each other or with each other). 

The games must not be too complicated and preferably should not be too stressful and hectic (time wise, he prefers turnbased games). We both really like strategy games.

Scoring: Metacritic score 30 days after release contributes to your overall totals

Roster: initially I was thinking that every month would occupy a roster slot. With so many delays, that doesn‚Äôt seem feasible? Maybe just 10 games with any release date with a few ‚Äòbench‚Äô games in reserve in case a game gets delayed out of the year. I‚Äôm thinking 12 active roster with 3 bench/reserve spots that only contribute if an active game is delayed out of the year.

Team count: It‚Äôs only the two of us right now as he is the only other person I know who actively keeps up with the industry. This might be ok as I worry we would have trouble picking games from a pool of 100s.

Draft: initial draft conducting in the next in a serpentine pattern. Supplemental draft conducted post July to deal with surpriseish announcements.

Recently I played through Moonlighter and I really liked it, and Now I'm looking for something simillar.

What I liked the most about the game was how you go into dungeon, gather materials, go back, improve your gear and delve again, this time deeper, rinse and repeat. I treated the shop owner bit only as a means to get money, I didn't pay too much attention to that part.

The platforms I own are PC, Android, Switch and 2DS XL so if there's something simillar to Moonlighter for these systems, I'd be grateful for any recommendations :)",1644495631.0

In league of legends, it doesn‚Äôt matter what mode it is, whether it‚Äôs ARAMs, blind pick or normals, someone has to complain about you not playing a meta champ, and even worse goes off if you died twice and call you a retard feeder and threatened to report you. Like wtf. 

In Overwatch, same thing, you play a probably not meta hero, and people start flaming. When you make a mistake, flame. You lost the game? Suddenly it‚Äôs your fault for playing an off-meta hero that you find FUN. 

Low ELO matches in both games are a nightmare to play in. 

World of Warcraft? Get vote kicked out of a dungeon because your damage is too low according to a stupid addon and you‚Äôre a lower level player. Newbies making a mistake, dying, or pet pulls. Instead of teaching newbies, they yell at them.

However, there are a lot of issues that need addressed right now. The overall state of the game industry in general and it's current monetization practices being exhibited by Rockstar Games and other companies such as Epic Games or BlizzardActivision - Is killing us softly, there is no denying it.

Many of my friends I used to play with on the daily have since quit, not just RDO or GTA, but damn near quit playing video games completely. All we have being offered to us are the same old AAA titles, which have rehashed content with even more rehashed content on top of it. Not to mention the huge emphasization on microtransactions and the creation of ""Battle Passes"" for nearly every online game. This brings me to my next point I'd like to make, which is developer morale.

Developers in general are getting lazy, which is not the fault of the little man. It is however the fault of each companies main constituents who enforce these lazy and greedy policies - That in turn, creates a base of workers that are fearing to speak up and create their own ideas - This creates an environment where people lack the necessary creativity and freedom to make FUN games! Video games used to be about self-expression and most importantly having fun (especially with friends!). Nowadays, you are lucky to purchase a game that has access to things such as splitscreen or a single-player campaign mode with hand crafted assets and environments. As all the focus has shifted to the online aspect, and the ability for developers to make money off of in-game purchases.

We see more bugs than ever because IT IS ENCOURAGED for programmers to simply read off each others code, or to even copy and paste things just to get it done before the deadline. With people like Micosoft buying out many of the once large household name tech companies, we are entering an era of which that is inhospitable for the artist. The individual who seeks to create something unique, or a step above the rest. For the last couple of years especially, I have since quit playing many new games also, and instead have been occasionally starting up old titles just to get that nostalgic feel again. What I am asking for is not just some nostalgia trip or micro-transaction-less experience, but rather a return to form of some kind.

I hope any and all who reads this has a wonderful day, life, whatever - Stay safe and don't get 360 noscoped by covid 19.",1644514248.0

I'm conducting a review on Player Balancing mechanics in multiplayer competitive games, so I'd like to collect more examples of these mechanics in commercial games, and this is where I need your input. These mechanics would be ones that enable low-performing players to catch-up with stronger players (either by benefiting those weaker players or by handicapping the high-performing ones), during a single match.

**Examples:**

* Ultimate Chicken Horse: You can change the percentage of points you get on the score card. For example, 50% means that you get half as many points as you normally would.
* Mario Kart: The probability to obtain better items from item boxes increases the lower your ranking on the race is.

I mostly play shooters online, and have had good times in the pillar games like Halo, BF(4), GoW (Horde), The Division, RDR2, Last of Us, and some others like Titanfall, Crossfire(bootleg Counterstrike).

But sometimes, paradoxically, I feel that makes the game world seem *smaller* instead of *larger*. This is because in games that employ fade-to-black transitions to segregate different areas, it allows me to imagine that your character has traveled some distance where nothing much happens, so the game doesn‚Äôt show it to you. The only plus side I can think of with seamless open worlds is that feeling you get when that huge landmark off in the distance grows closer with every step and eventually becomes explorable.

Making a seamless open-world game is kind of like trying to make a movie without any cuts. There is this one movie like that called 1917 where it seems as though the action was filmed in one long take. Technically impressive, sure.

However META isn't always good, since sometimes, extreme focus on characters who are in the META usually results in the community trashing on characters that aren't part of that exclusive club or don't carry their team.  Or that the META is so extreme that it spills over into causal play where you're fighting random players online for little to no benefit.

A major example of META hurting a game is Mario Kart Wii.  Before, you could just pick up your favorite character and Kart and race with random players.  But ever since it's META came out along with CTGP, its literally Funky Kong Flame Runner or nothing and the META has been so cemented into this combo that if you don't have this combo, YOU AUTOMATICALLY LOSE!  MK8DX has this to a much minor problem where it's Wild Wiggler and Roller but unlike MKWII, any character and combo with a high skill level could wipe the floor with them.

Another flaw with META is that it might often expose obvious oversights that somehow went past the developers.  Using MKWII for example, how anyone in the dev team looked at the bikes abilities to constantly wheelie and get speed boosts, negate Acceleration stat with stationary boost by holding acceleration and brake button together when your Kart is at a standstill to boost to max speed or how inner drift might completely overpower outside drift bikes and might negate the need to use karts.  And don't even get me started on character specific stat boosts

And when you're playing something like Armored Core or Front Mission, it doesn't really matter if you specialize your mecha for either high mobility, defense/tanking, close-quarters combat, or long-range combat, because you're still piloting either an AC or a Wanzer, and still playing one of these two games as originally intended.

But with Sonic's friends, ever since the Adventure series for the Dreamcast, you *deviate* *too far* from Sonic the Hedgehog's signature speed every time you have to play as any of the other characters.  Whether it's treasure hunting with Knuckles and Rouge, or mech shooting with Gamma, Tails, or Eggman, or fishing like with Big the Cat.

&#x200B;

Look, Idk about the rest of this community of gamers, but I'm tired of pay to win.  

Wanna go free to play and charge for cosmetics, MORE POWER TO YA! 

Wanna go free to play and divide modes for the ""no money spent"" crowd (at least not for competitive advantage) and the pay to win crowd, that's AT LEAST an ok compromise (even though they're not ""FREE TO PLAY"" this is where I'd love to see all the sports games go with their ultimate teams, which they never will without government intervention).

HOWEVER, when it's just, hey, we have a F2P game, and here's t the deal....pay us, and you 

a) play early (competitive advantage if the game has ANY pvp, because you gain in game spoils sooner AND have a head start on the game's learning curve)

b) depending on HOW MUCH you pay, you get more to hoist you right along the way.

TWO GAMES that I REALLY wanted to play recently that I haven't touched or decided to learn that much about due to the fact that they've decided that those who pay will have that big leg up were

Pokemon Unite and now, Lost Ark (here in the Western launch).

I don't feel good about buying in game currency, xp, etc...(and the whole preying on people's FOMO is genius business, but feels scummy as hell from a consumer's perspective imo...just let everyone play).

So, I miss out on the fun of these games, but I feel a lot of us are just saying, ""screw it!""

Yeah, make your own choices, and if it's worth it to you to pay to win, go for it...however, recognize the slippery slope that our choices are buying.  Pay scales for access to pieces of games that are just created, then withheld are becoming the NORM rather than something we as gamers/consumers say ""nah, we're not ok with this crap"".

Fighting games are dropping DLC ONE WEEK AFTER LAUNCH!!!!!  That's just giving you 6 slices of pizza and saying, ""We'll let you buy the last two at a premium price tag!  Isn't this great""

IMO, no, not great.  So, I'm asking my fellow gamer to consider the consequences to those among us with less disposable income now AND the consequences to those of us who are just not willing to be ripped off on principle alone now or in the future.

These consequences as I see them are that a good chunk of our hobby is being RUINED, straight up.

One of the reasons I think League of Legends is so popular is that we DON'T have the option (anymore, see runes, if minor) to simply buy victory.  Say what you will about buying champions with real money or in game currency, but I find that when they're not literally selling gold to buff your character mid game, they're doing something right.

Similarly, Path of Exile's biggest sin is probably charging for inventory space, which imo is still a smaller version of p2w.  However, that's one I've compromised on after getting value I deemed above and beyond the 0 dollars and 0 cents I was supporting them with, and I felt almost compelled to buy some stash space as a thanks for the entertainment I once (and still sometimes return to) got from the game.

Just some food for thought, and I KNOW this has been said a million times, but I think we need to tell devs what we WILL and WILL NOT accept when it comes to paying our hard earned money for our hobby and put our foot down if we think they've gone too far (which in business, is really a line drawn in an imaginary tug of war that comes down to how far WE LET them pull us before tugging back).

Good day gamers!",1644443701.0

I found Soul series really easy even on NG+7 (hardest diff?) once you get the patterns down and the screen also gives you all necessary information, and that's **GREAT** game design, nothing against that, it's **FAIR** difficulty.

But damn, have they ever experienced the madness of ""Master Ninja"" in NG or ""Hell and Hell"" in DMC or older games when they are trying to bring DS up? I'm talking about the extreme difficulties, of course, Soul series NG+7 vs hardest of fast-paced games where you have to deal with literal chaos that kill you off in a single hit. The extreme side of Soul is nothing compared to them imo.

These games all do different things with the formula and design that Dark Souls put forward. They're all uniquely built, and have their own mechanics and aesthetic to them that sets them apart.

Lords of the Fallen has a magic class and customizable gauntlet that allows difference in playstyle, making hybrid faith builds work wonders, and with it's strict enemy designs and weapon types, it feels strictly balanced toward using all elements creatively as opposed to relying on one over others. Mono-type players will struggle here unfortunately, but once you figure out what the game expects from the enemy designs and gameplay limitations work well together. It even has a very colorful Diablo-esque aesthetic.

The Surge uses a part targeting system for loot aquisition, as well as vertical and horizontal attacks instead of light and heavy. You attack and sever the part of gear you want, simple as that. It makes farming a breeze and a ton more fun than what Souls offers. You can even bank scrap so you don't lose it when you die. Very convenient if you're afflicted with the curse of serial death like i am.

Code Vein offers a AI partner and coop system, as well as interchangeable classes called Blood Codes, which can be changed on the fly. It also has weapon/armor hybrids called Blood Veils, and specials attacks called Gifts, unique to each Code. The magic stat here is called Ichor, which is refilled by attacking, blocking and using the Veil as a parry, backstab or combo finisher. Veils can also be charged for a drain attack for more Ichor. This game also has a focus stat that increases when hit, allowing you to poise through attacks and launch enemies when full. Certain passive gifts are even activated by this stat as well as make it build faster.

Nioh plays alot more like an action hack n slash than a normal Soulslike, but the usual tactics can still apply to a degree. As you attack, you can use a Ki Pulse to recover a portion of spent stamina, and this spent stamina and ki pulse change bases on one of the three stances you can have equipped. One is for blocking, one is for speed, and the other is for damage, and each affect you differently as well as your rolls and iframes. 

These games are special to me because they represent whay can be done to take a formula and expand it into something new and refreshing. I'm thankful i got to play these in my lifetime, because this is the kind of creativity i want to see even more of in this industry.",1644440653.0

As someone fond of Destiny 2, I get a ton out of the battle pass/seasonal system. I fully expect to earn all the rewards and experience as much of the content I want with it. I evade the FOMO simply because I play enough to know what I want and don't want, and can get what I want. 

But because I like destiny and *want* to get everything out of the game, it takes up my evergreen game slot. I know that if I am (and I am) going to play destiny enough to play through that pass, I'm not going to be able to get the most out of other pass games. 

Warzone and call of duty? Dead by daylight? Halo? Knockout city? Sea of Thieves? Those are games I do like playing, but *knowing* I'm not going to get all the things the game is offering just takes a bit of the wind out of my sails when I hover over that play button. 

But of course, if any of those are your evergreen game that you come back to, you're feeling good about earning all that content. 

It benefits players that really choose to play the game, benefit$ the dev$, and catches some people through fomo at the cost of pushing people away through fomo.

**So, out of ALL of these games there are only three new games. One is entirely new (Triangle Strategy) and the other two are MP games (Lego Brawls and the FTP Disney Speedstorm). The industry (not just Nintendo) has a major problem. There needs to be new IP's added to keep the industry fresh and new. It's already evident that gamers are getting tired of all of these re-hashes, ports, and sequels. Also multiplayer online-only games and other GAAS are getting old. There are only a few really popular ones while the others fall away into obscurity.**

One thing I‚Äôve really enjoyed is playing those games where your levels don‚Äôt really matter but the gear you equip or make does.

Think of a game like dark souls, you can equip lots of different gear that gives you different stats but a high level character will most likely beat a low level one. Same rule for Pok√©mon. Even a level 100 caterpie could beat a level 1 charmander.

Then you have a game like Monster Hunter. There‚Äôs no real levelling system exactly, but depending on what gear you equip you can be more efficient prepared for a situation. And two characters at different points can be equal in ‚Äústrength ‚Äú depending on how they equipped themselves.

There‚Äôs just something about the ide of me winning a battle or beating another player not because I was over leveled, but because I worked to make a better system of equipment than they did.

So  my little brother purchased NBA 2k22 from the Nintendo eshop thinking  he would be able to play it on his switch without any problems. He was  surprised to learn that there was not enough space on his console to  even download the game let alone play it. First off, this seems  ridiculous. If you're not technically savvy how are you supposed to know  if a game is too big for your console. Isn't that the whole point of a  console? It streamlines the process of gaming? There needs to at least  be an identifier on the store saying ""hey your console can't run this  game"".

Needless to say he wanted  to return the game only to find that there is NO ONLINE PROCESS TO  RETURN GAMES. No, you have to call customer support and we all know that  takes forever. Then, once we were able to return the game, Nintendo  tells me (since I had to call) ""this is a ONE TIME DEAL"". I will NEVER  be allowed to return a game after it has been purchased from the eshop  ever again. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL! I haven't heard of a company refusing a  refund!

God is truth. its the truth that ps3 is superior since bluray is the way of the future with our games becoming increasingly needy of more disc space than can be found on the dvd hence the annoying streak of lame ""10 hours of gameplay for my $60"" which i am experiencing wayy too much nowadays and hence the acknowledge meant of PCs with their installation- to- HD [schemes.MS](https://schemes.MS) is suddenly showing odd and too much interest in "" games for windows"" understanding how the 360 is coming to its end with titles like lost odyssey ranging to 4 discs. is ff13 4 discs long yet i can bet that ff13 contains twice the gameplay hours of lost odyssey's 4 discs combined. wat sort of an age do we live in when games hav to become 4 discs or even 2 discs long. ipod has more space than the dvd. a bluray can contain 50 to 60 gb of space. a dvd can contain 7 gb of space. a hd dvd can contan 20 t0 30 gb of space yet ironically the hd dvd for the 360 isnt made for playing HD dvd games. if its rumble u want then its coming to japan this year. i dunno bout u but im getting mine since my sis lives in japan with her husband and she is parcelling me dual shock 3 twins.ppl say sony doesnt value the customer. i say any franchise that can eat their words like hard candy( rumble is the past) and sell true next gen consoles at staggeringly high losses so that we can enjoy the future doesnt look like the bad guy.blu ray is just one point. the power of the ps3 is a whole new ground. i hav always said ps3's power lies in superior engineering not in som numbers like ram: 512 MB crap. i hav noticed the textures on uncharted and they r (lol) off the charts amazing not to mention motorstorm.a system that has this much power and the disc space to go with that power really looks like the way of the future. id just like to say one more thing and that has to do with criticism. this goes for everything. when analog stix came out every1 criticized it and now look at it. when scarface came out they wanted to rate it XXX and critics went with wat was the popular act at the time and booed it except 1 critic who remained got it right . those same critcs today admit their faults and re-rated scarface as one of the best films of its time. ppl say the ps3 is crap but 1 year or even 6 months from now they wont eat those words because they are gonna b too busy playing mgs 4 to remember to regret the words from their past. not me. i dont ever regret owning a ps3 now and i never will. anyone even thinking of calling me fan boyish think again coz i own both next gen systems and currently just finished halo 3 on legendary alone. had a blast literally",1644488853.0

When I lunch the game - it crashes without error a few seconds after and I don't know how to fix it. I've tried everything and it still doesn't work.  

I have RTX3060, I7-11700K, 16 GB RAM so the specs are not a problem.   
I don't have overclock and all my drivers are updated.   
Tried to lower the graphics to low, changed to directX 11, 11 enhanced, 12, and no improvement.   
I put it on fullscreen, windowed, didn't change anything.   
I checked my storage or memory (ram) if it was crashing but there were no errors.   
I deleted the anticheat and uninstalled it and cleared the download cache and did a fresh install more than 4 times.   
I tried to run the game on one core only and it's still crashing.   
I restarted ""windows security center service"" and ""Windows Management Instrumentation"" I did the verify integrity in steam more than 4 times, windows is up to date.   
I went to the properties of the game itself and the TSL file and steam I put it on ""run as administrator"" I disabled v-sync. the antivirus doesn't block the game or interfere at all.   
Reinstalled the directX.   
Disabled the windows firewall and the antivirus.   
In the power options of windows, it's on the highest one possible.   
Reinstalled Microsoft C++ runtime. Performed clean boot, disabled the overaly apps.   
The game is fully updated to the fact that I reinstalled it too many times.   
Deleted the temp files, deleted the PUBG files from appdata.   
Steam launch options are clear no text there.    


As you can clearly see from above I've tried anything and it's still not working, if you guys have any suggestions that may help please put a comment down below, Thank you.",1644440124.0

We like shorter games where you can play a match/round in under 15 minutes, so that the time commitment is flexible (we can play for 10 min - 1.5 hr).

What if you still control the character but there's a AI that tags along with you the entire game and it's meant to be your character's consciousness. Was thinking the AI would help with decision making but also just generally make the character seem like more then just a character and help create emotional attachment and the AI would have a database of everything you said so it remembers decisions and everything. I think we currently have AI that is advanced enough to really sell that sort of idea but it's very expensive certainly to expensive to incorporate in modern video games which is why I was thinking it would have to be a video game in the future.,1644477371.0

sp1c0y,The true cost of a service like Stadia,0,0.37,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sp1c0y/the_true_cost_of_a_service_like_stadia/,39,"Just because I am terrified of the inevitable, I will make this post, as a gamer and as game developer.

Game streaming services like Stadia are bad for you financially in the long term:

The current subscription is 10 dollars a month, that is 120 dollars over one year. Consoles usually have a 5 year cycle.

This means that over the same time period you have paid 600 dollars, that is 200 dollars more than you would for a console.

You might say ""yes but Stadia gives me all of these games for this service, I would need to pay so much money to get the same level of content"".

This is only true for now, it is likely game streaming will follow the trend of video streaming, just like Netflix gave rise to Hulu, Disney plus, Amazon prime, HBO max...

So will other big companies compete with Stadia, these companies will fight with tooth and nail for exclusives, because it is THE only way to attract people to their specific platform for this kind of service. Say that Stadia, and a competitor have 80% of all games split between them, then you would need at least 2 services to enjoy most games now you are paying 1200 dollars over the lifespan of one console. If it is 3 services and you want all 3, it racks up to 1800.

As you can see, the option then becomes into either locking yourself out of most games, or paying significantly more than you did before.

I don't think this will do anything to actually stop the giant corporations that rule the world from getting what they want. But everyone else looses here. I don't want to have to develop for google, I want to develop for different sets of hardware that people own, I like being able to choose if I want my game to be on PC, Xbox, Play Station...

But if everyone gravitates towards this service then I have no choice but to either abandon the industry or let google put a collar around my neck and do what it wants me to do for profit as other giants have done with their storefront.",1644480296.0
