sph13w,hwfgmdu,t1_hwf7vhc,"Agree to disagree. *Turn The Page* is a song driven by its vocals. The story being told is carried to the listener by a voice made weary from a tour. The only verse that's supposed to have high energy is the third, when he's singing about the performance, which is immediately countered by the last part of the verse being soft as he switches to singing about laying in bed. Listen to the original. It starts with a lonely saxophone, then the voice comes in and stays meek through the first verse and chorus. The drums don't come in until the start of the second voice and even then, they are light and Seger is careful not to ramp up the vocals too much. The mood still matches the story being told. 

Now listen to the Metallica version. The drums come in halfway through the first verse because Lars can't wait and when he starts to play, it's so loud that James has to sing over the top. It immediately raises the energy of the song, ruining the feeling of what is being told. In other words, the sound doesn't match the story. Then James starts with his patented strain / gravel in the first chorus, further ruining the mood. It doesn't make any sense to the song. 

James isn't a good vocalist and frankly they should have avoided this cover. Their covers of more obscure stuff are fantastic. I have to think they chose *Turn The Page* because they knew it would get them in the radio often.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644533035.0

The Weeknd - House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence

House of balloons is about a guy's descent into depression and him losing himself to his drugs and ruining his relationship by being unfaithful. Thursday is the same guy with a different girl. This album is much more about the girl than it is the guy (not to spoil it but thursday gets really fucked up). Echoes of Silence is him fully embracing his drug-induced party animal lifestyle until the end of the album where he's alone and feels like he can't escape the hole he's dug himself in. Even though the protagonist of these albums is absolutely the villian, it's still emotionally devastating.

Alice in chains - jar of flies

This album is about addiction. It opens with the protag doing drugs for the first time or ""eating from the apple"" as the song says. The addiction stays with him until he's very old, the song ""don't follow"" being a warning to a young person, warning that drugs will ruin their life.

Here are lyrics from ""Right Ahead, Young Sailor"" where he is talking to the captain of the ship.


Oh sweet anna did you mean to do this to me
Ive been trying hard to be rational

What a woman, what a woe that you give to me
How long can i count to a thousand

I tried drinking but the bottle is still empty
I can only hope for a fresh one

You tried loving but i guess you could not love me
How long can you count to a thousand

I could be the bigger man, bigger man.
Yeah i could be the bigger man, bigger man.
But i just want to kill a man kill a man
Really what's a bigger man?

Oh young sailor do see you what your captain sees?
Love is nothing more than an action

What an ocean, what a world, on the big blue seas
You can change it all if you want to

My good leader what a self loving web you weave
I have got a son and a daughter

My young sailor what a point that you just can't see
Don't you think that they need a father

Breaking Benjamin is my personal favorite band (heavy and melodic with some screams here and there and great lyrics) ""Failure"" is a good place to start 

Evanescence (one of the bigger bands of the 2000's, hauntingly beautiful vocals with dark rock) you probably know their song ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Sweet Sacrifice"" is great too

Saint Asonia (a new-ish band with an excellent singer that is just overall a great band) ""Better Place"" is a good one to start with

Halestorm (another amazing singer with really fun energy filled songs) ""Freak Like Me"" is sooo addictive and the bridge blows everyone away 

Nightwish (has had 3 singers, has great storytelling lyrics and epic instrumentals) literally anything from live at Wacken 2013 is great 

Jinjer ( im not even gonna comment on the style of this band, just check out ""Pisces"" and prepare to be blown away) 

Icon For Hire (uplifting lyrics, with more pop punk instrumentals with a little pop and rap here and there) ""Make a Move"" is their biggest song, but ""Curse or Cure"" is one off their newer album that is also really good.

Then MTV was like, what if we had an acoustic-only concert with rock and grunge bands. It was new and cool. Plus it led to a lot of awesome songs on the best albums from the time. Acoustic usually isn't really a cool instrument, but MTV made it cool for a while.

sp5plr,hwemfjs,t1_hwdpjw2,"I came here to say this.  There are plenty of artists who should absolutely do an Unplugged performance, but many of them are older, more established artists.  What made Unplugged interesting in its heyday was that we were coming out the 80s with a synth sound and moving to an alternative ""grunge"" sound and so the artists performing, by and large, were giving a very different sounding performance of their hits.  Sure we had performances from artists who could perform acoustically in their sleep, but ""Layla"" certainly sounds different than it does on an electric guitar in its original rendition. 

The next layer of what made it so great is that the performances we consider iconic today: Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains all proved that they really did have the musical chops and ability to perform.  I don't think The Ramones would have sounded good unplugged, but that generation of talent who was inspired by punk rock DID.  

Many of today's ""relevant"" younger artists couldn't perform in this setting.  Again, there's plenty of exceptions, but who do you know today who sounds unlike anything that came before them, could play a setlist that's almost a third covers of songs few people know, and leave the remainder of their setlist devoid of their biggest hits be regarded as one of the best live performances of all time?",-1,0,1,0,-1,False,False,False,1644520664.0

The last studio I worked at was only $800 a day, not including an engineer or any assistant engineers, and they spent two million dollars on the building and equipment. If I did the session I charged $25 an hour, the guy above me charged $35. Clients were of course welcome to bring their own engineer, but most would choose to use one of us to assist because we knew the gear and the layout. So a full day of recording, like a 16 hour day, could easily come in under 2 grand.

If you aspire to do this, be ready to have multiple revenue streams--performing, composing, giving lessons, playing wedding gigs, working in a music shop, waiting tables, etc.--and have a back-up plan in mind. A common suggestion for a back-up plan is to get a music education degree, so that you can teach music at a high-school level to survive while trying to establish yourself writing music. I wish I could be more upbeat, but it will be difficult to make a living in composition, especially if you're self-taught.

**Edit** Also: Be practical! If you're hard-stuck on ""art for art's sake, no compromise,"" then heaven help you. Don't turn up your nose at writing music you don't personally like, e.g., for video games, TV commercials, etc.

Also also: Learn the business side of music. Know how contracts, copyrights, and royalties work. It does you little good to write a hit song if you've sold all rights to someone else for peanuts. OTOH, if someone contracts you for work for hire, you probably got paid a flat rate and they probably own it. IANAL.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644509242.0

That sort of thing can't be predicted, except by a few specialist music producers (who are in great demand). George Martin, Timbaland, eg.

The greatest song writers in the world, (Lennon/McCartney, eg.) didn't have every song blow up.

There are a few people who can write nothing but hits, like Burt Bacharach/Hal David and Chinn & Chapman, but there seems to be a divide between people who write whole strings of great hits, and those who actually perform songs.

soxuce,hwd4bhm,t3_soxuce,"These albums:

Deep Purple - ‚ÄúMachine Head‚Äù or ‚ÄúMade in Japan‚Äù. Jon Lord kills, and a B3 through a Marshall is a sick, sick sound. 

Emerson, Lake and Palmer, - ‚ÄúTrilogy‚Äù or ‚ÄúBrain Salad Surgery‚Äù. What can you say, Emerson is so great. 

UK - ‚ÄúDanger Money‚Äù. Eddie Jobson deserves more recognition, he‚Äôs a killer keyboardist, and on this album, they are a trio (Jobson, the amazing Terry Bozzio on drums and John Wetton). Their self titled album is also great, with Allan Holdsworth on guitar, but Danger Money is an organ forward album. 

Boston - ‚ÄúBoston‚Äù (the first album). Really good B3 playing here by Tom Scholz. 

Yes - ‚ÄúFragile‚Äù, ‚ÄúYessongs (live)‚Äù. Rick Wakeman, ‚ÄúRoundabout‚Äù, what more needs to be said?

Kansas - ‚ÄúPoint of Know Return‚Äù - Steve Walsh is a great singer and organist. This record is really inspired, although I personally don‚Äôt like ‚ÄúDust in the Wind‚Äù‚Ä¶

Gentle Giant - ‚ÄúFree Hand‚Äù. Kerry Minnear is a great keyboardist, and Gentle Giant is an amazing band. They make a lot of progressive bands look a little tame, to be honest, they can get really complex, but if you like prog and never heard them, well, you are in for a treat, and this album is a good entry point. 

Spock‚Äôs Beard - ‚ÄúKindness of Strangers‚Äù, really any of their many albums. Millennial prog, with the great Ryo Okumoto on keyboards. Steve Morse was their lead Vocalist and main songwriter up to the ‚ÄúSnow‚Äù album (caution, very thinly veiled allegorical Jesus lyrics on that one), but their post-Morse work is also really good.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644499923.0

When I was little, my parents listened to classical music, big band, and musicals.  When I was 10, I got my own AM radio, and started listening to rock & roll and pop music.  A couple years later my brother and I got an FM radio, and stayed up late listening to ""album rock"" radio.


Then I found out that the people who were playing the records on the radio actually did that for a living.  ""Wait...that's a job?!""  So I went to college and studied broadcasting, but really...the point of earning a degree in broadcasting was to get a job playing music on the radio.

It was 35 years from the moment I dropped the needle on that first record at the college radio station until i finally was laid off from my last radio job a few years ago.


It was jarring.  Not just to be unemployed and have to find a new job, but to find out for the first time that other people didn't have music around them at work.  The radio wasn't playing.  You couldn't listen to music at most of the jobs I've had since. If they caught you jamming out to a song on your headphones, you'd get in trouble.

The silence was deafening.  


I guess what I'm trying to say is that music never changed my life, because it was always there.  What really changed is that I realized how precious it was when I couldn't have music in my life while I was at work.  I started a new position on Monday where I can finally listen to music again.

First off, a lot of punk and rock music is going to focus on major chords. You‚Äôre going to want to start to learn extended chords: 7ths, 9ths, 11ths. Related to that, start to work on inversions of chords. 

A lot of jazzers focus on modes, so you‚Äôre going to want to look into mode theory. Here‚Äôs a quick intro: https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/music-modes-major-and-minor/

A lot of what I‚Äôve written is looking at ‚Äúcomping‚Äù or how to play melodies or to play chords to accompany a melody. 

The other thing to tackle as a jazz guitarist is soloing / improvising. This one is a giant weak spot for me, but the Berkelee site might be a great one to start at.

som1w9,hwdmyls,t3_som1w9,"I consider 50s music divided between before and after Elvis. The average age of the record-buyer at the beginning of the decade was the mid-20s, but in 1956--the year of Elvis--the age kept plummeting until teenagers were buying most of the 45rpm singles. And it's been that way ever since.

My father hated Elvis (my mom loved him), and he prefers the earlier 50s with Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Patti Page, Doris Day, the Ames Brothers, Johnnie Ray, Frankie Laine, Teresa Brewer, Bing Crosby, Julie London, Dean Martin, Perry Como, Nat King Cole. I was raised on this music and still enjoy it (so does my dad!)

The latter part of the decade was mostly dominated by rock and roll artists appealing to the teenagers: Bill Haley & the Comets (who were much more popular in the UK), Elvis, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers, Ricky Nelson, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Connie Francis, Brenda Lee, Harry Belafonte, Sam Cooke, Jimmie Rodgers, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darin, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Andy Williams, Kingston Trio, Richie Valens.

And don't forget the instrumental hits, there were a lot of those in the 1950s-60s. And numerous one-hit wonders (I love one-hit wonder songs!)

Artists from the 1960s (and there's a division here, too, before and after 1964, the start of Beatlemania) with artists from the 50s still going strong in the early 60s: Ricky Nelson, Connie Francis, Brenda Lee, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darrin, Dion, The Everly Brothers, Pat Boone, Sam Cooke, The Four Seasons, Simon & Garfunkel, the Mamas and Papas, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Temptations (Motown put out fantastic music during the 1960s), Supremes, Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Barbra Streisand, Monkees, Sly & the Family Stone, Sonny & Cher, Roy Orbison, the Shirelles, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Beach Boys, Little Stevie Wonder, the Dave Clark Five, Herman's Hermits, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.

Believe it or not, a lot of these musical artists are still with us.

The soundtrack to the 1973 movie American Graffiti is an excellent way to listen to a lot of late 50s-early 60s music, that's how I was introduced. I love the music from the 1940s through the 1980s and listen to it all the time.

sojff6,hwahs5c,t1_hw97keh,">-Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian rock bands, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.

Metallica has sold over 125 million records worldwide.  So obviously sales are not synonymous with quality.

>-The band ranked at No. 7 on the Billboard top artist of the decade list

Metallica ranked at no. 18 on the Billboard top artists of the 90s list.   Billboard rankings are apparently also not a measure of quality.

>- Sold out Madison Square Garden

Metallica sold out MSG, not only for a concert, but for a *listening party* for one of their shitty albums, back in 1991.  Selling out MSG is apparently *also* not a measure of quality.

>- Nominated for six Grammy awards, including ‚ÄúAlbum of the Year‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Rock Album.‚Äù

Metallica has been nominated 23 times for Grammys, and has actually *won* 9 of them for some fucking reason.  So Grammy awards/nominations are yet another thing that are not a measure of quality.

>Ranked as the second best-selling foreign act in the U.S. of the 2000s (behind The Beatles)

Metallica has sold 6.7 million records in Canada.  I don't know where that puts them as far as rankings for foreign acts in Canada, but it's a shit-ton of sales.  High sales in countries other than an artist's home country are not a measure of quality.

>- The eleventh best-selling music act of the decade overall

Metallica is the 34th best-selling ""music"" (I guess) act of *all time*.  Once again, sales are not a measure of quality.

> 12 juno awards

Metallica isn't even from Canada and has won a Juno award (nominated for 5). Guess what's also not a measure of quality.

>- 6 Billboard music awards

Metallica has won 3 of them, out of 3 nominations.  Need I remind you that those awards also are not a measure of quality?

I could go on and on, but the point is that if Metallica can get all those accolades, the accolades obviously don't mean shit.  If nothing else, they certainly don't equate to *good* music.

We generally think of it as a classic rock staple now. It was very controversial at the time, even panned by many critics. The Beatles took a huge chance giving up the road and becoming a studio-only band. To thrive, they had to transition from singles-based music and develop concept albums with deliberate sequencing meant to be listened to as a whole. (Rubber Soul and Revolver were deliberately sequenced, but Sgt. Pepper was the first Beatles album that blended tracks and offered a unique experience when listening to the whole thing.)

 While they weren't the first to deliberate sequence albums, and this wasn't the first concept album, both  practices were still very much on the cutting edge, and basically adoption of the album format by stars on that level led to domination of the album format in the 1970s.",6,0,0,0,6,False,False,False,1644429497.0

That‚Äôs kinda why I mentioned Faur√© cuz that guy lived so long ago yet has music featured in movies that get released these days not only because his application of music theory was essentially flawless but he evoked emotion through using a lot of folk melodies from the region he lived in that also just happened to be a center of musical appreciation at the time. Imo folk music/music with social commentary is the best music, of any culture, cuz it‚Äôs really the peoples music.

Listen to the *Brewery Sessions* version on YouTube specifically. Get back to me. You might realize you actually do like some country.  
  
Tyler Childers - Shake The Frost  
Tyler Childers - All Your'n  
The Band - The Weight  
Colter Wall - Devil Wears A Suit And Tie

There's a big country revival going around and it doesn't have anything to do with Garth Brooks or even rednecks necessarily.

I'm just putting up the easy gateway stuff that's hard not to like. It's not the country people usually think of. More related to 60s alt country (like The Band)

That is, until you get to *Barry Bonds* and *Drunk and Hot Girls*.  
I will say that Barry Bonds is nowhere near as bad as Drunk and Hot Girls, but its still just mid.  
Drunk and Hot Girls is quite frankly just a bad song and it completely ruins the vibe of the album, its a skip every single time and I have no idea why Ye decided to put it on the album over Bittersweet Poetry.

sod8ux,hw8kcth,t3_sod8ux,"Having known the original Sound of Silence first and appreciating its thematic somber tone immensely, I did find Disturbed‚Äôs cover - while somber in some ways - kinda lacking in the original‚Äôs more deeply resonating approach and therein the feelings elicited from that sonic approach. 

Not to say I dislike it as much as some seem to, but it does sound flawed to me in a way where while I can appreciate aspects of the cover, as it all comes together, I don‚Äôt find it intriguing or captivating, especially in comparison to the original. I‚Äôm doubtful I can adequately describe how I feel towards both original and cover even in what detail I‚Äôll go into, but I find the original to be like lightning in a bottle with everything coming together optimally to create something special and wondrous in tone and feeling, as opposed to Disturbed‚Äôs cover which seems for lack of a less critical word ‚Äòcontrived‚Äô in how it seems very deliberate in its approach, but very safe and not very interesting in the specifics of its unique approach. And this is coming from someone who does appreciate bombast and other such over-the-top theatrics in rock and metal.

Though, while I doubt Disturbed would make music I‚Äôd ever be very interested in, I think I could appreciate and enjoy in passing if they made original music of theirs with a similar orchestral-backing and sometimes quiet-loud sort of template, with David‚Äôs vocals which I consider one of the more interesting and appreciable parts of the handful of Disturbed songs I‚Äôve heard. Though a full album of orchestral quiet-loud sort of ballads would be far too one-dimensional I figure, so I would welcome more metal incorporated in a significant portion too, though my proposed idea may not be worth taking since, as I said, I doubt I would be part of the audience really engaged with this hypothetical approach from Disturbed for original music as I figure other bands I already like would hold my interest in the vein of epic kinds of rock/metal incorporating orchestral instruments/arrangements. But, I could at least appreciate them taking a crack at writing original material in this vein, and I suppose I could even like some of it here and there, but that‚Äôd definitely be a ‚ÄòI‚Äôll know if/when it happens‚Äô sort of deal, as while I have somewhat liked some of their music in the past, the music would have to be a lot more interesting than what I‚Äôve heard from them to actually be listened to in full and/or more than once from me.

So I think not liking the cover much, for me, has to do with their approach just not melding with or complementing the parts of the original they kept in a way that made the original‚Äôs approach better (which I feel it wasn‚Äôt exactly trying for) or different which, while both having differences in approach as well as similarities, the cover‚Äôs approach just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. Lacking a lot of what made the original good, but not adding in an adequate replacement to live up to the original, but in a different way. Though the cover isn‚Äôt really bad in my opinion, I just feel like it falls a fair bit short of the original in how I like it.

Also, speaking of covers of songs Paul Simon has been involved in making, while I also don‚Äôt like this cover as much as the original, I do rather still like Hexvessel‚Äôs cover of ‚ÄúDiamonds (On the Soles of Her Shoes)‚Äù which Hexvessel just titles as ‚ÄúDiamonds‚Äù, but I like it‚Äôs specific psychedelic folk music approach as it‚Äôs a style I find interesting, and it‚Äôs quite different in an interesting way to me. Probably more different in sonic themes than Disturbed‚Äôs SOS is to S&G‚Äôs original, but an approach I personally like. Though still not as much as the original, but it‚Äôs a version I like enough to hear every now and then of my own accord.

sod8ux,hw8tiu1,t1_hw8n7ub,"Thanks, and yeah, I‚Äôm doubtful I‚Äôd seek out hearing new music from Disturbed either. Rather since in previous years I‚Äôve heard some of their music via old-ish (10-15 years ago) pop-culture like the Guitar Hero/Rock Band video games, and I‚Äôve been involved in some online music communities where people play songs via youtube or other sources for the group together, that in my experience with said media and groups that Disturbed‚Äôs songs I‚Äôve heard in settings like those generally were songs that were fine by me, albeit only some songs had somewhat interesting parts, so I wanted to temper my criticism with an admission that there are aspects of their music which I can sorta understand the appeal of, albeit I don‚Äôt like it enough to prefer to listen to it over anything else I can think of when choosing what to hear is up to me.

So, while I don‚Äôt entirely understand the appeal of Disturbed‚Äôs music as fans seem to apparently get more enjoyment from it than me, I can appreciate the subjectivity involved, and even relate in how some music I really like is also seen as mundane and tired by some.

Not sure how popular this opinion is as I‚Äôve only seen it a few times, but I‚Äôve heard similar claims of finding this other band‚Äôs music boring and mundane. I‚Äôll use them as an example as they‚Äôre a metal band that‚Äôs often incorporated symphonic elements, so kinda relevant in how they have some vague similarities to the cover song in this thread. The band is Therion and I think that they‚Äôve mostly released good albums to me. (Only real dud of theirs to me (of the Therion albums I‚Äôve heard) is the bloated Beloved Antichrist album, but I also haven‚Äôt heard the album that came between Theli and Vovin because of its reputation,) but I‚Äôve seen others who find many of their albums boring or sub-par, even though I like the solid albeit not unique death metal of ‚ÄúOf Darkness‚Äù, the death metal + symphonic metal of ‚ÄúBeyond Sanctorum‚Äù, the more symphonic power/heavy metal approach of their later 90s and early 00s albums and so on, including last year‚Äôs album from Therion titled ‚ÄúLeviathan‚Äù which I recognize as not be experimentally groundbreaking, but is still a fun, epic, and largely engaging album to me. But as I‚Äôve seen people who don‚Äôt care for them anymore or like one person who‚Äôs said they don‚Äôt see the appeal in any of Therion‚Äôs music, I can use as an example of having similar experience to those who like Disturbed and hear those who don‚Äôt. 

So I do think I can empathize in some ways with how Disturbed fans who like the cover and their other music, like something that others find uninteresting and bland. Not that I think this sort of experience is rare, but just using it more as a personal example of the subjective disconnect between those who like some music and those who may dislike it, or even not exactly dislike but just find it lacking or boring.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644425484.0

Now many new artists get popular by themselves using the online space, way before any label eventually signs them. Also, listeners can have whichever niche music they want no matter how obscure or regional, delivered to them on a plate by simply typing some key words into a search engine. 

I think on the whole, this can only be a good thing. The argument now is that if you can‚Äôt find good music, you are just not looking hard enough. Because it‚Äôs there and accessible to all. 

My only criticism of the current internet era regarding music is the echo chamber of opinion. Artists making unoriginal, or even bad music have their large fan bases posting never being rivers of praise online, music critics are now few and far between. People are constantly having their potentially bad taste reinforced by the online community to the point where many listeners of shallow, badly written and performed music cannot handle the concept of criticism and react to it with outrage.

But it is somewhat the same in this sense; good music will live on (like the music from the 90s you listen to now) while bad music will have its 15 minutes of fame and then die off into the mists of time. There was always temporary, trend based music from all eras and much of it was quite bad. We just don‚Äôt hear it anymore.

If you weren't alive back then, then it's hard to grasp just how much of an imprint the Cold War left on the world, and it's impossible to explore it fully here. Part of it was the fierce battle of ideas going on, and it had more than just the two main sides. That battle affected everything, including music, art and culture in general. I think the net cultural effect&mdash;consciously or otherwise&mdash;resulted in an enormous growth in creativity in lots of areas, including music.

Therefore you should just look at albums that sound great on any format. And, arguably, those are probably gonna sound best of all on CD (and more so on SACD if you have the means to play it).

so35u4,hw6krdx,t3_so35u4,"Hi-Res and Spatial Audio are not the same thing.

I am doubtful that either is being transmitted via AirPlay, especially to a non-Apple device.

I tried looking it up on Apple's web-site and on their high-res page they don't reference AirPlay. On their Spatial Audio page they reference the Apple TV 4K as being able to play back Apple Music in Spatial Audio with certain speakers, but the link to which speakers is a non-relevant link.

Some other non-Apple site says AirPlay can transmit up to CD quality.

For a while I tried following Apple's lossless, Hi-res, and spatial audio announcements (which all came at once), and I found it very confusing.

From what I can tell spatial audio references a couple of things. It seems to be tech in Apple's headphones to tell that you are moving your head and adjust the sound accordingly.

But then, they started saying their Macs and Apple TV box had Spatial Audio. I didn't know what that meant because those devices don't track your head movement. 

Confusingly they also refer to it as Dolby Atmos . . . which I guess Spatial Audio is their branding of it?

My take is that Spatial Audio is some sort of recreation of multi-speaker set up through stereo headphones and that in the case of the headphones it ALSO refers to knowing your position and when you move your head and adjusting the sound accordingly but it doesn't refer to that with their products that don't measure your head movement (like Macs and Apple TV). I think.

Hi-Res is just better quality compression, which is limited by output (Bluetooth in particular has low bandwidth which is what all of Apple's headphones use.) Apple doesn't seem to specify from what I can tell what AirPlay uses, but other sources seem to say CD quality.

And lossless, which the entire Apple Music catalog is available in, means no compression but would only be useful in a wired setup and if you have very oddly good hearing. Even Apple says this should make no difference to most people.

 - TL;DR : artistic decisions that arguably obscure the intent of other, previous artistic decisions probably require deeper analysis as to whether they‚Äôre beneficial inclusions or not




I think there‚Äôs an argument to be made that artistic decisions made based on trends, which also counteract a song‚Äôs ability to express its artistic intent, can fairly be considered ‚Äúbad.‚Äù 

Autotune was a massive trend, and for late 2000s, early 2010s pop and rnb that was trying to go for a futuristic, synthetic sound, it‚Äôs a texture that falls in line with that intent. Autotune on, say, a rustic and acoustic bluegrass ballad, feels generally out of place by comparison.

Similarly, Californication being a bittersweet mid-tempo pop-rock track prominently featuring clean guitar tones and moody vocals with sparse effects, it would probably stand that compressing the dynamic range of these sounds to a noticeable degree would undermine the intent behind most of the other creative decisions made on the song. Considering the other commenter‚Äôs reference to the popularity of a fan-made ‚Äúunmastered‚Äù version, it seems like this is a generally held feeling.

I agree at the end of the day a creative decision is a creative decision and ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù is up to interpretation, but I think it‚Äôs constructive to consider what it is about certain creative decisions that allow for impactful and compelling art.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644384741.0

Now, Traktor does have an analyze system itself, I'll run that in a sec to make a screenshot, but like other software when you do want the BPM you'll see that every now and then there are songs being either double BPM or half BPM. Not the end of the word since i can simply adjust it while playing with special buttons (x2 /2) for that. And I want to see the music keys. My Traktor [studio](https://i.imgur.com/7fvocPC.png) of some analyzed tracks. 

*I had this written for in the end, but maybe better to show right away for when the screens looks so shitty ;)*  


> Screenshot resolutions are probably way off. My normal monitor I have to redo some setting, it's not getting a signal and hard reset didn't work (I changed input from VGA to DVI and now I can't go in a menu, but that's a thing for later today cause [I had a very old one laying around](https://i.imgur.com/gF8MZc2.jpg) and was racing and gaming on my TV anyway most of the time. 






What I liked other than that, it's not free (but you can find it 'free' somewhere) is BeaTunes, especially the correction of artist names, titles, albums, titles, finding duplicates and then easily select to keep the ones with highest bitrate, the oldest file, the longer file etc. It's also useful for the smaller things like the removal of who uploaded it, small or big spelling mistakes, genre is less important to me since I know what most tracks are...let me run an example with some new stuff I needed to analyze.  

So, since it also links with Discogs, I looked for your specific titles and made some screenshots [they have hundreds collections per title](https://imgur.com/a/IpQaZiU) When you click on each individual you see they specify almost east track while in the long screenshots like this, it looks as if they just name it all the same and  of course it has duplicates, [so one of them](https://i.imgur.com/G1jKtB4.jpg) should always be right ;) to find the correct titles for you. Beatunes also has 'colors' which makes it easier for DJ-ing and making playlists of 'the same mood' type music. 
 

kay, added some random folder I had to analyze. [First started to](https://i.imgur.com/DhBaaOp.png) check them [on duplicates and errors etc](https://i.imgur.com/Y96v5zg.png), here it's what it [will scan for](https://i.imgur.com/CjpmDn1.png) when you'd select almost everything. 


What I tried last week though IS free and can ALSO do that and is called...erm...I'll get back on that in a sec but already wanted to write this before I forget. I get that it will make less sense when you read it in one go. Found it, One Tagger. It says: [""Great for DJ's"" or something](https://i.imgur.com/2ciFujx.png), but when it comes to house music, unless you look up the popular stuff, it's often hard to get good sources, in a way with you and game soundtracks too. You still need people who have added it. I was recently making a playlist of old hardcore 90s/00s and hardcore simply isn't a very popular genre worldwide for much input on these sites. 

[One Tagger on Github](https://onetagger.github.io) and it looks like this when I start 'er up. Some of the [sources it will check](https://i.imgur.com/kIUlPbp.png) even without an account there. Started it and it first checks one source and then the missing with other sources. So far [hit and miss on Beatport now](https://i.imgur.com/OrqwOLL.png).....[five mins later](https://i.imgur.com/BjhTS42.png)

On your last question, I do think I saw the option in one of the programs, I just can't find it that quick which one (maybe I uninstalled it). I never had issues with that because I normally just do Flac or MP3. What you could do is download: [""Everything""](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) which is a Windows Search tool. Whenever I look for a track and either the title or whatever is missing/faulty, but I do know the length, I can sort on that. When I do know the format, I can quickly sort on that. That way you could achieve what you want yourself within seconds per file format when they are in relatively close folders to each other. If not then it's still pretty quick to sort them on that, cut and paste them in your own folders. 

[Here, easily sorted](https://i.imgur.com/0YQNrUJ.png) No Windows Search where you can take a 3 week trip, come back and it's still searching.

3. Insurance and safety.  Concerts use to have less security, and less complicated rigging so safety was less of a concern.  Now you add in the pandemic and it is insanely difficult for a touring act to get insurance let alone afford it.  Plus pyrotechnics, laser safety, moving stage pieces, etc.

Artists have been asking for and/or demanding, depending on clout, higher and higher guarantees for shows for years. So promoters have had to find a way to not only cover that growing nut, but still make some money doing so.

Without even talking about arena and stadium acts for a minute, look at the parties involved in even a 3k cap room. Tickets are set at say $50, so it's a $150,000 show. Add $18 fees per ticket, now it's a $200k+ show. Even with TM skimming a little bit of that, the promoter basically has $50k more money to play with now. And this is without even getting into venues, promoters, and acts reselling their own tickets. Face value is often not market value once you get to a certain level of popularity. And everyone knows that, including acts' agents and management.

People hate thinking anyone besides some douchebag suit is getting their extra money, especially not their favorite artists, but why wouldn't these acts have good teams behind them figuring these things out with the douchebag suits?

Local radio promoted local live music. The better bands got on the radio and broke through to national radio. That's gone now.

It's all on the internet now. It's also true that recording is expensive and isn't as attractive as it once was, since it's now essentially advertising for the musician(s) rather than a way to make money, so bands are less incentivized to record these days as well.

However, for sheer volume, there's probably more music now than there has ever been, and a more diverse selection than ever.

You can record something on your phone and still ""live in the moment"". Its super weird to imply that anyone filming something on their phone is mentally detached from reality and their only way to recall the night is through \~3 min of phone footage. Its also weird to think that people only take the video to post online for bragging rights or whatever. Cheering on artists that have ""no phone policies"" is weird for many reasons if you think for just a few minutes about what the implications of that are outside of people holding up their phone for a couple minutes.

I think this reaction is way overexaggerated. I've been to a lot of concerts in the few years before covid cancelled all live music, and never saw anyone holding up their phone for the entirety of a show. I've never seen anyone whip out the iPad to obscure anyone's view, the biggest device I saw was somebody hold up a 3DS to take a picture, but it was obviously a joke and everyone around had a good laugh about it.

Personally when I go to shows, I record maybe two or three of my favorite songs, and hold my phone at chest height or just below my eyeline (6'4"" so I'm already blocking somebodies view). Just point it in the general direction of whoever is the most interesting on stage, If I get it I get it, if not I still have the audio, which looks and sounds pretty decent on a modern phone. Even while recording I still have situational awareness for when a crowd surfer is coming my way I can help keep them up. And I am glad I took those videos, because for over a year, I didn't have anything and it was comforting to be able to go back and relive those moments.

sny5vi,hw6rhof,t3_sny5vi,"Coming from a working musician's perspective, most people don't realize how influential the audience is to the energy of the show. An audience who's parked on their phones filming is not engaged like an audience living in the moment and responding to the stage. When the band and the audience are on the same wavelength and firing on all cylinders, there is an electric energy to the room that cannot be achieved any other way. Once you experience it once (from either the audience or the stage side, but especially from the stage side), you try to get it back every show. It is live music at its absolute best.

At the end of the day, not every show (regardless of the artist) can be like that. It's a special occurrence. I've personally never had it happen in a massive stadium...an absolutely packed club where the audience is right up to the end of the stage is the best place for it. But regardless of the venue, passively watching the concert through your phone screen does not contribute to that energy. Being a good audience is an ACTIVE experience. Obviously the band has to be good for that to happen, but if you're going to see \[insert favorite popular artist here\] one would assume they will be.

I don't really need ""phone free""...there's nothing wrong with taking a picture or filming a couple clips. We all want to get some record for posterity, and/or show our friends we're at a killer show. But just parking up to film the whole song or show is a different thing entirely. As an audience member I'm definitely almost entirely off my phone, and ideally as close to the front as possible.

I would even pay double the ticket price if it came with HD video footage of the show.

The costs could cover/pay a lot of people, more than cover licensing, and would definitely give me better memories than some bullshit blurred blown out from lighting fx shaky cam pic from 70ft in the crowd.

The issue I see isn‚Äôt peoples phones, it‚Äôs people wanting to capture that moment for themselves but it gets in the way of everyone else behind them.  This seems like a modest solution for me.  No cameras, no flashlights, no excuses.

That is not what that article is suggesting.

Those articles only argue that taking photos contribute to memory offloading, and the NPR article even suggests that if you are conscious about the way you take them it can **improve** memory.

\> Because people don't use their videos and pictures since they are almost universally low quality

None of the article linked make that claim at all. Most modern phones can record in 4K and even budget phones record in 1080p.

So there‚Äôs this place in northern Florida called The Spirit of Suwannee that is absolutely magical. This is a venue and they hold multiple feats, but want to tell you more about the venue as a whole. What makes it so good you may ask‚Ä¶..??

Lineup - completely subjective, but this venue that puts on festivals year round focus on the jam scene but also bluegrass, funk, etc. 
They get the top tier and know how to properly set a lineup to curate a wonderful experience.
Another point is all the festivals I‚Äôve been to there have two stages but only one band on at a time.
They have a more electronic fest at Halloween called hulaween and Suwannee rising is a little more Americana. Always a solid lineup though. 

Venue- outdoor. Set in a swamp in Florida complete with Spanish moss and the likes. You can (could) camp with an open fire, and the camping is around little ponds and grooves. Golf carts can be brought or rented. Keep in mind the biggest fest they throw is still less than 10k which compared to a big fest is my main reason to like it. 

You don‚Äôt have to worry about keeping up with friends really and I would easily pop back to the campsite during the middle of a set for whatever and come right back. Security was not a factor. Keep in mind I haven‚Äôt been since 2015 but this place is special in my heart. Specifically bear creek in 2013 was my favorite of all time.

This is Hardcore in philly.


I get it, Joe Hardcore is a shithead, I agree, but from launch to 2013 or 2014, this was the best weekend of hardcore anywhere. 

Most people there had seen most of those bands dozens of times, and it was so damn long, it should have been exhausting and boring. Perhaps it was in the grand scheme but so many bands still managed to have incredibly memorable sets at this fest. Over the years Title fight, wisdom in chains, converge, code orange kids, madball, trapped under ice, h2o, bane, youth of today, and gorilla biscuits all had sets I think about years later. I‚Äôm not a bad luck 13 fan, but I brought a buddy in his 40s who hadn‚Äôt ever been to a hardcore show one of the last years I decided to go (13 or 14). He still talks about those redbull bar tables flying around the electric factory and that dumb fucking kid getting pounced on when the cinderblock came out of his bag. 

It was like 3 months worth of great shows in one weekend, and that‚Äôs if you were lucky enough to live in one of few cities that put out great hardcore and were a stop on most notable tours.

It basically is the 1950s equivalent of alternative because of how the overdubbing and effects on guitar create a unique sound and somebody singing in harmony with themselves was pretty revolutionary.  Also Les Paul could shred.

They tend to sound a bit samey, and only one album is all you need, but his hits are incredibly important for the history of music.  It's a shame he doesn't get talked about more.  I guess that's what happens when Rock and Roll changes pop music a few years after your big break.

I think Come Together does a good job of setting the tone for the record considering the last one they released (The White Album) was the exact opposite of that sentiment. It's also a fairly up-tempo compared to the rest of the songs on Side A, though admittedly not by a lot.

There is also the physical aspect of cutting the record. Side B is 22:10 long with the whole medley and they could only really fit 25 minutes per side in 1969. Side A with Come Together is 24:53 long so if we move Come Together as you suggest, Side A will be 20:34 and Side B will be 26:29 long which was physically difficult to cut no matter how you order the tracks",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644354417.0

And playing even one tune will let any listener who's aware of the concern know that the artist is at best unaware of the concern, and at worst the artist is aware of the concern and still okay with reminding people in the audience who might have related trauma. That's not a good look.

And how our fathers music taste from the 70s shapes our music taste, and shapes our nostalgia for the music our parents played when we were young

I think it's a mix of the weird anti-disco white men who are our dads now which closed them off from pretty much all r&b after the 60s and the angst which was popular in the 70s and even more so through the 90s/2000s for a lot of young men. 

Like my dad likes some Earth Wind and Fire but seems to think a lot of their music is to disco-y

Between the popularity of rock and grunge/nu-metal i think  a lot of us and our fathers paid little attention to soul/funk. And any stuff that did get popular was considered (at least to my dad) to be pop-y and substanceless and written off before given a chance. So the music my parents played, and I'm nostalgic for now mostly consists of classic rock and pop hits like Cindy Lauper

And if it wasn't rock, hip hop served a similar function with its similarly angsty music for 90s kids

No it doesn't, and no it's not. At worst people call music experimental if it's not immediately accessible to their ears, which sure, can be said pejoratively if that person is just being a dick. But for every one time I hear that, I hear ""experimental"" 1000 times more used as a way to show what a genius someone was (ie, Miles busting out Bitches Brew, lots of Zappa stuff, Captain Beefheart, etc), someone jerking off to their own music because they're too cool for school, or, as I said in my first post, as a descriptor to not expect something that fits within the confines of the ""norm"" (like free jazz or something).

As as for ""what norm,"" I even said in my other post that it is mutable. Music evolves, as do peoples' tastes. There were literally centuries when dissonance was outside the norm, and then eventually it became one of the main aspects of jazz.

snm00x,hw55lpq,t3_snm00x,"Robert Johnson - He sounds exceptionally raw and might not seem spectacular but that would be because he was the first of his kind. Everything blues related you hear stemmed from that guy

Howlin‚Äô Wolf - Iconic voice, with some iconic songs. Everybody‚Äôs fightin‚Äô about a spoonful

Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins - Same vein. Had such hits as Baby Please Don‚Äôt Go and Shotgun Blues

John Lee Hooker - Boom Boom might be the most recognizable blues song out there

Sonny Boy Williamson - One of the all time great harmonica players. There‚Äôs a live video on youtube where he comes walking out in the smoothest manner I‚Äôve ever seen and introduces Lonnie Johnson who plays Another Night To Cry, completely tears the place apart. It‚Äôs sort of surreal seeing what blues performances were like in the 50‚Äôs, I‚Äôll see if I can find the link

The 3 Kings; BB, Albert and Freddie - All blues gods, highly influential across the board

Muddy Waters - Same vein. There‚Äôs a pretty epic recording of him and Johnny Winter doing Mannish Boy, I‚Äôll come back with this link as well. I haven‚Äôt been able to find the whole concert if it even exists (especially in that high of quality) but I‚Äôll keep digging

Stevie Ray Vaughan - I think this choice speaks for itself. The live albums are especially incredible but my personal favorite is Carnegie Hall. Hearing Cold Shot with that sort of ‚Äúloud‚Äù ambiance is exactly what the original recording needed IMO

Eric Clapton - Before you throw pitchforks at me because hating Clapton is Reddit‚Äôs favorite activity nowadays hear me out, put everything aside and just listen to the guy. The unplugged album, One More Car One More Rider, and Riding With the King (namely, with BB King) are up there with my favorite albums of all time across all genres. The man is wickedly well versed and surrounds himself with some excellent musicians

Kenny Wayne Shepherd - He and his band are fantastic live. Fun fact Chris Layton is his current drummer, who was half of Stevie Ray Vaughan‚Äôs backing band Double Trouble

Eric Johnson - He leans into a sort of jazz/blues fusion but *man* if you get the chance to see him live do so, he puts on an absolute clinic. The set from Austin City Limits is definitely worth checking out, the solo on Desert Rose slays

snjuol,hw6b55g,t3_snjuol,"""Which"" is a tough question with so many answers üòÖ
Here are a few of my personal favorite movie soundtracks:

""Singles"" - several big names of grunge, an era and genre which I personally love

""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" - Ennio Morricone's masterpiece in my opinion (I have to mention Cinema Paradiso's soundtrack which is also wonderful)

""Pulp Fiction"" - In my opinion one of the best movie and soundtrack when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's movies, I'll always love and rock to that Dick Dale surf rock intro

""Saving Private Ryan"" - So powerful and emotional that it perfectly fits the movie itself, one of the best John Williams' compositions and also one of Steven Spielberg's best movies

""Into the Wild"" - This is Eddie Vedder's at his best solo work, simply brilliant and remarkable, just as the movie and the journey it depicts

""Trainspotting"" - Another great movie and soundtrack filled with plenty of the great britpop and britrock hits of that time

And I am sure that I could remember and mention others as well, like Inception, Reservoir Dogs, Purple Rain, Baby Driver and so on, but these were the ones, an in no particular sorting criteria.

MIDI is digital, so static isn't a thing (data loss is though).

I have a pet peeve when people complain about there not being good music these days, because there is better music with way more musicians, and way more access to music all around the world than in any time in history, just some google searching away. Just to be clear, I'm not talking about your comment, you had good qualifiers.

&#x200B;

Its just, hey, there are 7 billion people on the planet and I hear people in america complaining about the lack of good music but they do no searching and dont explore music from around the world and new subgenres.  They just recall their nostalgia for some past decade of music mainly from their own country/region and arent open to new things, like comparing every woman you meet or date to your first girlfriend or something lol.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644370810.0

he shows people in his music videos how he's throwing money, jumping on girls asses (haha) u no this luxurious living with him making dumb faces. also he made a track out of his own fart (he used it as a sample).

The Bandsplain host seems to be really into rock in general, so it's cool to hear her enthusiasm about bands I never really gave a chance, it makes me more interested in checking out the band again. For example, they had an episode on Goo Goo Dolls, who she  seemed to love and knew a lot about. I only ever knew Goo Goo Dolls as a cheesy Nickelback/Creed/Seether dad rock type band and thought they were a one hit wonder with that song Iris, but then after listening to Bandsplain, I learned they started off in the 80s as a straight up punk rock band.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,True,1644347495.0

sn1s33,hw138sx,t3_sn1s33,"Not that I'm even beginning to compare them musically, but...

I look at the drama in Fleetwood Mac as akin to the drama surrounding KISS.  

If you read their respective autobiographies/believe their stories, they're a bunch of guys who figured out early on that they hated each other but stayed together/got back together for the money and to feed their respective egos.

To quote a Dave Mason song, ""there ain't no good guys, there ain't no bad guys.""  I saw Mac on ""The Dance"" tour (my ex was a huge Stevie fan) and watched Lindsey on ""Behind the Music"" again a few years back, and it seems like they're all less than stellar people in one way or another, but they stayed together/got back together for the money.

Like The Eagles or Crosby, Stills and Nash, they've got their respective ""camps,"" a team of lawyers, separate tour buses, and I'd hate to be an assistant to any of them having to shuffle messages back and forth to get them all on the same stage at the same time.

Great band.  Talented people.  Classic albums.  Bunch of spoiled egotistical people trying to keep it going no matter what.

sn1s33,hw1ujge,t3_sn1s33,"I've spent a bit too much time reading and talking about this band and the making of their albums and such, but I guess I see things differently. Lindsey is basically a self-admitted jackass and bull-headed, and there's no doubt that he's probably the most technically gifted member of the band.

The problem is that these guys go way back, and have done everything together, they're a real band, and you build some incredibly strong relationships and trust in one another, especially when you're forced to sing harmonies on songs that are basically trashing you because the writer was mad.

So, you've got a dispute and this or that happens, and then the problem is:

> Buckingham goes on to sue Fleetwood Mac for breach of contract

Now, one of the members is suing the whole band. WTF? At that point, it really doesn't matter, and if I'm a member then I'd have banded together with the other members and told Lindsey to eat dirt; it's a dirty move. It's not a competition.

And it's never really been about musical ability either; Stevie's songwriting, style, stage presence, and frankly, lack of traditional musical training, made her an indispensable part of the band. 

Given that, I don't think Lindsey can take credit for anything more than getting the rest to seriously consider Stevie Nicks, once she's in the band she's never seemed to have been doubted by anyone. I think she gave up being grateful before I was born, to be honest.

Anyway, I think the band will usually side with Stevie when it comes to ""Lindsey is being a dick"" again; I'm guessing it was more than a minor disagreement but that's my theory.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644301068.0

smz7si,hvzygw1,t3_smz7si,"I would put Sabotage as my favourite album and I genuinely think it's their best.

The song writing goes up a real step; epics like Megalomania and The Writ.

Tony Iommi truly pushed the production to a point the band had never reached, it just sounds like what I always call a ""big top"" album; like it's really grand scale and just feels more.

The performances of every member of the band are insane levels: Bill Ward's drumming on Symptom of the Universe, Iommi's riffs are their most heavy (Symptom) and beautiful (Supertzar - so much so that Ozzy declined to do a vocal over it as he said it would ruin it!), Geezer's lyrics are clever and so often tinged with the extra sting in them this album and Ozzy pushed his vocals so far that his voice was totally shot forever more after the album.

I've spoke before of how I feel Born Again with Gillan is a very underrated album. A terrific rocker of an album that grooves along so well...just a shame about the final mix.

One of my favourite Iommi riffs is Country Girl. Not exactly a song that's talked about as a Sabbath great or anything, but I just adore that opening riff to it. So thick and heavy, I feel it typifies Mob Rules as a whole album.

Ozzy is on record as saying he hates Never Say Die! But I have to question when was the last time he listened to it...or even how much he remembers from making it given his issues at the time. It's a real creative force of an album. The guys are trying a lot of different things for various good and bad reasons. It's weird Ozzy hates it because it's the closes I feel a Sabbath album sounded in terms of what Ozzy then done with his solo work.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

You are not on Youtube, your music is on youtube but you don't have a channel or videos. I would suggest Instagram or TikTok for you honestly. But Twitter is good too. Like I said Instagram and TikTok have a discover feature and TikTok has the for you page. So even when you are not promoting your videos. These platforms have algorithms that show your content to people it thinks will engage with that content for you. That's why you want to be there. It's like why businesses go to the mall. People are already at the mall. Any promotion the mall does is promotion for you. If someone asks any mall employee where to get the best food, and the employee things they will like chicken, they recommend your restaurant. That's the benefit to being where people already are.

Also you need to post consistently. Putting out an album or project without a fanbase increases the likelihood it will flop. You want to wait until you have a fanbase that is asking for a project from you. No one is searching your name or music so you want to post covers of popular songs people are searching for.

Mods generally work on teams through consensus but something as inane as approving or denying a user-submitted link in all likelihood would be done by one individual- whoever happens to be handling reports and new links at that time.

Try posting your link at a different time of day when perhaps another mod might be approving links?  /r/music has 21 mods so surely you can get your link past at least one of them.

It might make sense to post your music in more genre-specific subreddits too.  /r/music is broad after all so someone who likes the specific genre of music you make would have an easier time finding your song in a genre-specific sub than they would browsing through thousands of posts in /r/music.

There's 1 song on every album that I think could be done away with or 1 element that just stops it slightly from total perfection.

Black Sabbath: take your pick of Evil Woman or Warning. The band were just a bit too bluesy still, even though I love the jamming sections of Sleeping Village and Warning.

Paranoid: This suffers from just about every song being overplayed to the point that you've lost that loving feeling slightly with things like the title track and Iron Man. Rat Salad isn't the best of instrumentals and the less said about the album cover the better.

Master of Reality: I like After Forever but something about its melody and portions of the lyrics just feel a little off at times...I'm not sure if ""simple"" is the word I'm reaching for but just ever so slightly it's not as good as the rest.

Vol.4: FX and Changes...come on, we all know this.

Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: Who Are You? Yeah really not a great song, it's just so much poorer than the rest of this album.

Sabotage: Am I Going Insane (Radio). Exact same as last entry.

Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! Have more issues than those initial 6 in the Ozzy original run so neither is close to being perfect anyway.

It's like you've been allowed into someone's private therapy session, stuff they would go through a therapist with and it is just...haunting.

As I've got older I've felt more and more troubled when hearing this song. It feels like such an invasion, we really shouldn't be hearing this. When I was young and first heard it the feeling was ""oh its so awesome how he cries and Ross Robinson is amazing for getting him there"".

These days it seems the dream of being a musician is largely just a subsection of being an influencer now for many, and indeed many millions of people seem at peace with soaking up banal, commercially/committee produced drivel. Lots of people I know treat music as disposable these days, it's not a deep source of meaning for them just another form of entertainment, and that is reflected in the popular music today. Overwhelmingly disposable and generic imo.

Of course there has always been great music being made and there has always been drivel, as is the case today. But I'm not sure that 30, 40, 50 years ago people were so disconnected from what good music even is. Every time I hear someone proclaim Taylor Swift as a meaningful, profound voice for her generation I die a little inside. 

Joni Mitchell's best known song - 'I remember the time you told me love is touching souls, well surely you touched mine, 'cos part of you pours out of me in these lines from time to time. You're in my blood like holy wine, you taste so bitter, and so sweet. Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling, and I'd still be on my feet'

Taylor Swift's best known song - 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (Whoo-hoo-hoo)' 

Undoubtedly it's snobby and high-minded of me, but I can't help but pity people who think Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran are great artists - it's hard for me to believe anyone could think that if they were aware of what great, meaningful, personal, idiosyncratic art really was.",-7,0,0,0,-7,False,True,False,1644237995.0
smowbi,hvya3wy,t3_smowbi,"The biggest genre nowadays I see happening on bandcamp doesn't seem to have a name yet, but it's a wave-type genre.   It recycles music from before 2010 and takes the piss out of it.  It's absolutely not serious at all.  Maybe it could be called boomerwave or maybe plunderwave or something like that.  It resembles plunderphonics, but these are sonic jokes all targeting classic rock.

I heard one e.g. that roasted Grease.  It just started off ""a wella wella wella HOOH!! Temmy moor, temmy moor, temmy moor, temmy moor"" and just looped that bit for a minute and a half while screwing the sound up every couple of loops.  That song is, shall we say, Not a Favourite, and it made me laugh.

I heard another one that took Rush's Tom Sawyer and pitched it down a fifth, so that Geddy sounded like a dude rather than a strangled ostrich.  Made me actually like the song.  I heard a similar one done with the Velvet Underground's All Tomorrow's Parties so that Nico would sound even more like a zombie.   It seems to be a big thing to pitch things down so that the vocals sound comical.  I heard a few that did that to Bryan Ferry and of course someone had to do it to the Bee Gees and that was comedy gold.

I heard one take ELO's Don't Bring Me Down and slowly pitch it up throughout the song so that by the end it was chipmunked beyond belief, and on the final ""down"" (the one with the cavernous echo) it suddenly dropped it an octave below the actual record.  That one put me in the floor.

One of the best ones I've heard took the Beatles' With a Little Help From My Friends, and pitched only Ringo's vocal up half a step, while leaving the rest of the song as is, so that Ringo would be singing the entire song out of tune.  20 seconds into that and my sides were hurting from laughing.

Still another really good one was called ""Why The Eagles Suck"", and it was every looped instance of that pentatonic thing The Eagles seemed to do in every song -- ""*we'll find out* in the long run"", ""searching for the daughter of the *devil himself*'"", and so on, even the instrumental instances  -- it just ran through their entire catalog and threw every single time it occurs into the blender.  I thought, spot on, got that one right.

Sometimes it's instrumental.  Someone took King Crimson's 42nd at Treadmill, and when it got to the bit where the band plays fast, it doubled the tempo.

Maybe the funniest one (I was unfortunately taking a sip of coffee when the punchline hit) was the closing rendition of I Cant Turn You Loose from the Blues Brothers' *Briefcase Full of Blues* (oh man, that aged about as well as Grease), looped it so it would play twice, and immediately following the stinger it cut to the Robin Williams New York Echo punchline:  ""*Shut the fuck up!""*  Needless to say, the coffee came through my nose.

Not a song example but Taylor Swift singlehandedly raised an entire generation of young empowered girls off her catalogue. Are the lyrics themselves profound? Debatable, but they meant something to those billions of fans and related to them on a level many others can't. Seems pretty profound to me.

Same can be said of JB and Sheeran, tbh.

Ultimately yes, but that's a very modern (in fact definitively postmodern) perspective. For thousands of years it was implicitly agreed art was grasping at profound meaning, at various times different words were used - the best known surviving term is [The Sublime](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+sublime&client=ms-android-oneplus-rvo3&sxsrf=APq-WBtUWW1pMQQDdDypoCu7bg96O0y49A%3A1644243391570&ei=vykBYoKjIoeM8gKJiquwDg&oq=the+sublime&gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBAgjECcyCAgAEIAEELEDMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQguEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEOgcIIxCwAxAnOgcIABBHELADOgcILhCwAxBDSgQIQRgAUM0KWKgNYJsPaAFwAXgAgAGQAYgB-QOSAQMxLjOYAQCgAQHIAQrAAQE&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp). 
Implied in such a concept is something beyond mere subjectivity. 

I would argue the death of a higher notion of artistic merit and it's descent into mere subjective preference is exactly what facilitates the infantilised life dealt out en masse today.

In the 60s a 40 year old would be embarrassed to listen o The Beatles, and that's as it should be, not because The Beatles are bad but because having a cultural archetype of progress - of growing up - is good. Nowadays it is widely assumed there is nothing *ultimately* wrong with immersion in saccharine simplicity 24/7. That's why good films can't get funded, because adults would rather watch children's films. That's why the rich historic cuisine of Italy, for example, is dying in the younger generation and being replaced by fast food culture. Historically we were told to be embarrassed to live like a child, now we are told there is no such thing as sophistication, it's all subjective so who cares. 

Ultimately I can't argue with the postmodern critique, because it is true - it *is* all just subjective preference at the end of the day, it's just a tragedy so many have taken that so far.

To try and bring this around - I have no quibble with young people who listen to and enjoy Taylor Swift or an one else, but I do find anyone who makes the argument 'ultimately Taylor Swift is no less profound than Bach and Taika Waititi is as meaningful as Shakespeare' to be deeply depressing and culturally malnourished. I sort of don't think anyone believes that either - it's just a language game.

After that, just start making noise till you make some noise you like. 

As far as how to put a song together? Spend some time listening. You want to make pop? Listen to a couple pop songs and write out the drum parts and maybe the rhythm of the main hook. This lets you see visually how it all fits together. You'll quickly notice there are a handful of beats that show up a lot. Get a sense of these beats and what sort of stuff people are doing over them. These are your building blocks.

In general a pop song is going to start with a musical hook or chorus. I'm talking a catchy, attention grabbing lyric or a juicy synth line or something. The chorus is generally the most important part of a pop song so you really want to focus on it. You should have an idea in your head that gets stuck there. If it's not stuck in your head, it might not get stuck in anyone else's.

A trick that has worked for me during times of creative frustration: take a song you like and try to write it yourself.

Reaper's only ""downside"" is the lack of included instruments but free instruments are so great nowadays you'd be better off using those. 

Here's a few pointers :
Vital is a great synth
Sitala is a good simple to use sampler 
Melda's got a free effect suite that covers a lot 
There's a lot of other stuff but depending. What toute looking for that should get you started.

You just decide if it is worth giving a second, third listen. It helps if there is something on it you are already familiar with and like. Over time, you become more attuned to what the artist is about if you like it and will maybe get more of their work or something similar. 

The songs on most LPs are not really related in the manner that something like Pink Floyd's music is. Most are not concept albums. They are, however, what the artist is into at that point, and as such will have some continuity between the songs. You will mostly find that there are some songs you don't like at all and others you think inspired. That is a personal thing. Your buddy next door might like the same artist and disagree on which stuff is the best. 

And I have to say, sometimes you will not get what the artist is about and won't like it. But come back to it some time later, you might be saying to yourself , ""how did I miss this?"" I have done that more times than I can count.

As far as actually listening to it. I usually just have it on in the BG while I am doing other things, just as you describe, and many times I find the same thing you do: That I have played it and not really heard it at all. But then, I might have it on while doing something and I realize that I am now paying more attention because there is something REALLY interesting going on now. And NOW, I am doing nothing but paying close attention to what is happening. And you can bet that I will prob play that again many times. 

It isn't an instant thing most times. You have to learn what they are doing, and you have to learn about different types of music.

To me, this means you may be listening to the wrong stuff. Sounds like you need to find something you have a more visceral reaction to.

My recommendation is to just listen to as much varied stuff as you can until something grabs more of your attention. Try some metal or jazz or something else outside of your comfort zone.

My recommendation for an album is The Sciences by Sleep.

They are a long-form stoner metal band. 

I recommend it for a couple of reasons though:

1. The songs are long

2. But they are groovy in a weird way, hard not to move your body to it.

3. The lyrics are abstract, no right and wrong, no reason to pay attention to them.


So, all of that adds up to something you can put on and just do things. Since the songs are long, your mind wandering for a minute doesn't mean you have missed it. It being groovy and hypnotic means you are more likely to feel it than just listen.

Now, the style may not be to your taste but I think the format will be something that is a bit easier to sink into than something that is a collection of 3 minute songs.

Not a playlist. So here‚Äôs how I would suggest listening to albums: look for music that has a thematic album. In the old days, bands like Rush, Yes, the Beatles, and others would create albums that told a story. (Rush 2112 is a great example). So when you listened to the album, you were actually listening to a story via each song. I don‚Äôt think groups do this today. It might be worth looking into groups today that use albums as storytelling. That will really help ween you away from the context of a playlist.

If you look at the entire Beatles catalog, each album was significantly more complex than the last.

The last song on revolver was ‚ÄúTomorrow Never Knows‚Äú was an indication of where the band was going. I think some of this is lost on music today, which are isolated, auto tuned, high production artifacts.
Look at the evolution of The Who, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and many of the ‚ÄúProg Rock‚Äù bands of the early 70s.  Plus, many of those players were extremely accomplished musicians, being able to play multiple instruments. That is much less common today.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644264804.0

AC/DC hit their peak with Highway To Hell (1979) and Back in Black (1980), and then they middled through the rest of the 80s. In 1990 they released Razor‚Äôs Edge, which includes their mega hit ‚ÄúThunderstruck‚Äù. 

Ozzy had a hit record with Blizzard of Ozz in 1980, and then had a few hits, but mostly middled throughout the rest of the 80s. Then he released No More Tears in 1991.

Somebody mentioned Neil Young. His career is pretty wacky, but could be *very* loosely summarized as: 70s good, 80s bad, 90s good. 

Tom Petty‚Äôs first few albums are classics. The 80s were mixed until ‚Äò89 with Full Moon Fever, which was obviously a big hit. 1991 brought us Into The Great Wide Open, which was solid.

Two of the tours were with the original lineup for the reunion and one to support the very underwhelming record Done With Mirrors before  they‚Äôd gone to rehab and cleaned up the drugs. 

I really have no idea how that means they were ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù but I guess in 2022 ‚Äúopinions‚Äù are more important than facts? 

Im not a huge fan of bands soldiering on with diminished original lineups either, but denying reality is denying reality. Skynnyrd isn‚Äôt broken up even through they have one original member. Foreigner isn‚Äôt broken up even they re-record old songs with a new lineup and often perform

Bernie Worrell (Parliament/Funkadelic, Talking Heads) - I smoked a bowl with him before his show in New Orleans. Very warm and friendly guy.

Tina Weymouth (Talking Heads) - Met her during Bernie Worrell's show (above.)  I danced with her a bit before she danced her way to the stage to sing backup.

Wayne Coyne (Flaming Lips) - I've chatted with several times. Very nice guy who makes time for all his fans. I used to live in a house that was featured on one of their album covers (well, the toilet was featured)...he and I chatted about that house and the high number of deaths we both witnessed caused by the train tracks that run just yards away.

Les Claypool - I met him very briefly outside a bar in New Orleans. He took time to greet some fans, but wasn't gonna hang around and chat.

Larry Carlton (Crusaders, Steely Dan) - My buddy was recently working as his tour manager / audio engineer and invited me to their recent gig in town. He was super nice; we chatted about sandwiches and local beer backstage.

Charlie Sexton (Arc Angels, Bob Dylan) - I worked as his audio engineer one night. We didn't chat about much outside of monitor mixes and stage volume, but it was still cool.

Hickoids - I don't know if they count as famous, but I've worked as their audio engineer a handful of times. Jeff Smith (lead singer) is a super solid, friendly dude. Just make sure he uses his own mic on stage.

sm6asd,hvwhbsq,t3_sm6asd,"Not my story, but my step dad has told this story so many times that I know it about as well as he does, and I love it so much that I don't mind how often he repeats it.

My step dad grew up in eastern Iowa in the '70s. One summer, there was set to be a big concert on an island in the Mississippi River. Van Halen would be there, having just released their debut album. And then Journey would take the stage, who earlier that year released their hit album *Infinity.* The night would end with a performance by the Doobie Brothers.

My step dad and his friends really wanted to go to this concert, but he was a bit worried about pitching that idea to his stuffy God fearing father, the type of guy who thought Rock and Roll was Satan music. My step dad's saving grace came in the form of his boy scout troop master, who organized some community service hours for the troop valeting cars at the concert. So my step dad of course volunteered for that. Working only before and after the concert, he had free reign to wander around and take in the music during the actual show. And all the boy scout volunteers were given all access back stage passes.

So my step dad and his buddy are wandering around back stage when they get stopped by some big tough looking guy. ""What are you kids doing back here??"" the guy demands. My step dad sheepishly shows the man his back stage pass, and tough guy's demeanor completely changes. ""You kids want to see something really cool?"" My step dad and his friend look at each other skeptically, but decide to follow the guy. He proceeds to take them to the trailer where the Doobie Brothers keep all of their guitars, and my God is it a sight to see, especially for an aspiring guitarist like my step dad.

A while later, my step dad and his friend are both out in the audience in front of the stage as the Doobie Brothers come out to start their portion of the show. And who should sit down at the drum set but my step dad's backstage tour guide?  So that's the story of how at about 15 years old, my step father met a member of the Doobie Brothers and didn't even know it in the moment.

Another time, my step father ran into a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers just waking down the street. They were coming from opposite directions, and my step father thought he recognized the guy from quite a ways away. Except that my step father mistook him for a personal friend. As they neared each other, my step dad wasn't totally sure the guy was who he thought he was, and the musician was clearly aware of what was going on. RHCP dude could see that my step father thought he looked familiar, and was clearly shying away, hoping my step father wouldn't recognize him from the band. My step father never said anything to his ""friend,"" and it wasn't until a while later that my step father figured out who he'd actually run into.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644206217.0

All over the place, depending on your tastes - the 'problem' is that because music is more accessible than ever we're also inundated and overwhelmed by the sheer *amount* of music out there it's basically impossible to sort through.

Like with anything you'll get the best results by doing the work yourself but unfortunately that's time consuming - being more involved in the process of discovering and 'selecting' new music versus being fed something by an algorithm can make the listening experience totally different. I recommend a mixture of [rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/) and [sputnikmusic](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/) +  a [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home) profile to generate some general recommendations for similar artists you already enjoy.

sm1lz5,hvuhv9a,t3_sm1lz5,"It's totally dead, just like jazz is totally dead.  The best you can hope for now is a niche market.   There are going to be flukes here and there (someone mentioned Greta van Fleet) but the rock era is not coming back at all.  Too much has changed.

For a starter, during the rock era, if it was more than 4 months old it was ancient.  You weren't going to hear it in public.   When you went into the record store it was all what had come out in the last couple of weeks.  Tuesday was the day you went in America to be first, and Friday was the day in the UK.  I don't remember what it was in Canada -- I think it was also Friday.

The other thing is that albums were short.   35-40 minutes was what you got.  Sometimes you'd get a double and it would be CD length but those were seen as over-indulgent and didn't happen very often.  You got that much music to have until the next thing came out, which was generally about 8 months later.

When the Beatles took their year-long break (only ""Lady Madonna"" in the spring, and ""Hey Jude"" at the end of summer came out between Magical Mystery Tour and the white album) it was unheard of for them to go that long with that little being new.

Nowadays everyone is so hung up with nostalgia that they forget everything was compressed in time and it flew by, blink and you missed it.  There were only Beatles on the world stage for 6 years.  Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin were 3 years.  Cream was 2 years.   The whole psychedelic era was about 9 months.  Blind Faith was a single summer.  That time compression I think is what drove, having lived through it.

There's also that element of newness missing, the feeling of ""I've never heard anything like this before.""  I love new music but I can describe the creator's record collections generally.  My first impression of Greta Van Fleet, for example, just because they were mentioned was ""they don't like Led Zeppelin at all do they?

IMHO, I see more acts or artists on the scene.  More studio tracks, fake drums, vocal tech to help people that can't really sing.   Thus the music has changed.  I'm curious if the way music distribution has changed has impacted the idea of a traditional Rock Band.  Back in the day, you went down to the record store and bought an album. You listened to side A, then side B and usually in one sitting.  I'd venture to say now music is released more in the form of a single that you buy on line and then you shuffle them up with other songs.  While I'm sure some still do, I'd estimate fewer full albums are released like they used to be and even fewer are purchased as a whole.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644167990.0

sm1lz5,hvvquqg,t3_sm1lz5,"Rock is a shapeshifter, and no matter how much you love old classic rock, to be on par with those, you need to do what they did in a broader sense. Moving on in some way. Working to sound very much like the old rockers is in itself a resistance to the creativity that the old rockers had. It took me years to realise this. ""Why don't they do exactly like they did before?"" Well, you can't. You can be massively influenced but not do exactly like they did. Because it's paradoxal to sound like they did and also DO what they did. They didn't sound like some old rocker. Accepting that made me love music even more.

I think the needledrop's album of 2021 ""The Turning Wheel"" by Spelling is a brilliant rock album. That's the shape of rock today. It might be called art pop? Glam rock revival+beatles influence. It's hard, but it doesn't really matter. Rolling Stones was Gospel/Country/rock 'n' roll/Blues/Folk, but is really only called classic rock today. Spelling is not very popular, but it definitely has it fans. That might be an interesting point here. Time might make it grow?

Someone might mention Greta Van Fleet. They are famous, and I enjoy them somewhat, but they do it a bit wrong when I consider my arguments above. I'd say Dungen is a better example of a band that succeed in sounding old and yet doing what the old rockers did, being them selves.

I'm going to put synthwave to the side because that's legacy stuff and corporate muzak recycled for the purposes of taking the piss out of it.  I like it because it's funny.  Classic Rock and Weather Channel music needs the piss taken out of it in the worst way.

There seems to be a new version of the plunderphonics genre developing.  National Cynic Network (who work with Negativland) seem to be leading the way.  

Whatever I rock I see on bandcamp is never something that would appeal to grandfathers usually.  It's always metal of some sort, usually extreme, but sometimes the weirdest combinations possible, like the one I heard (forget the name of the band) but was a mid-period Xysma-like version of Kim Wilde's ""Kids in America.""

On the other hand, Pearl Jam is a introspective band that provided much more weight in social commentary through music in their songs. The music of both bands are enjoyable and can still be relevant til today depends on set & setting (Crue for Partying, 80s nostalgia, catchy tunes; Pearl Jam for reflective moments, 90s nostalgia, listening to lyrics)

That being said, as public figures in music they havent been very relevant for a while now. Crue retired about a decade ago. Meanwhile Pearl Jam is a stable band but they havent exactly been groundbreaking for decades.

Nikki is 63 and Eddie is 57, I think they should have way more important shit to worry about which kinda begs the question as to why theyre still holding on to petty beefs underlined with the Hair Metal vs Grunge theme. 

Either these folks got nothing better to do than being petty, or this is some kayfabe storyline to gauge the reactions of their respective fans.

The ultimate modern pop album. So brilliant that it influenced pop top-to-bottom ever since. It's the sadder, wiser, less dreamy older sibling to *emotion* but still shares that album's belief in the pure emotional power of great music and real feelings.

**Tegan And Sara - Closer**

In which the twins go fetch a shiny pop sheen for their songs. It has a similar 80s glow to *emotion* and shares a lot of that upbeat driving charm.

**Charli XCX - Charli**

Other Charli fans might suggest other of her albums, which is fair enough. I think this one just hits best for the sheer pop thrills and biggest choruses.

slss2g,hvsn71m,t3_slss2g,"I am a guitarist who plays in an ambient / post-rock band - Assuming you already have a guitar and know some chords, Id start with getting a small pedalboard - you really don't need that much to begin with, but a reverb and a delay can be the building blocks of the ambient sound. A big plus if you want to add some modulation effects (chorus, vibrato, etc..) for some extra depth. If I were a beginner, I'd focus on getting a reverb and a delay pedal, so many options in all price ranges, but if you want to get something that's (relatively) affordable, yet reputable, looking into Electro Harmonix, TC Electronic or MXR or Boss - They are very prominent pedal companies, so there are many used options available for not a lot of money!

I‚Äôve seen them almost a dozen times since 2001 and their live shows are consistently the most brutal, precise and well received concerts I‚Äôve ever seen. And they get better as they get older. Consummate professionals.

Their last album was released in 2012 to blanket media acclaim. They tour semi regularly - last show was pre-Covid, a bushfire fundraiser festival in early 2020. They‚Äôre also planning an anniversary tour for that Rollins produced album which keeps being delayed because of Covid restrictions. But they haven‚Äôt released a single song in 10 years. There was similar gap between that last album and the one preceding it, so basically they‚Äôve released two albums in twenty years.

Band founders/brothers John and Kim Scott both have high ranking jobs in government sectors (Kim is in intelligence AFAIK, not sure about John) so new music is not a priority, if even a desire anymore.

Another drawback he only played with himself and his own guitar he never recorded with a band if he had formed a group with himself leading it. They could have spread the word of mouth better. Since Robert was solo he probably had a harder time getting shows, exposure, and In turn gaining a following in his own time.

What I expect with music like this is that you lay down the baseline (not bass line, baseline - I don‚Äôt know proper terminology) with the first couple of bars, and when you bring in the other instruments, the piano takes off and starts doing it‚Äôs own thing.  I also would expect some sort of change but it‚Äôs the same chord progression all the way through, isn‚Äôt it?

The most important thing, though, is the result.  Sure, it could be better, but what you have is a nice tune that‚Äôs enjoyable and easy to listen to.  If this is one of your first composing/recording projects, then you have a really bright future.

Check this tune out.  It‚Äôs a jazz trio‚Äôs take on Ode to Joy from Beethoven‚Äôs 9th.  I feel like this kind of think might be a guide to where you can go with this sort of music.

There's not enough time in life to do, really anything. 

The list of shows on my list is massive. Movies are easier to knock out but there are still tons of them if you include the older stuff and the schlock. 

Books.... don't even try, you'll never make a dent. 

Comics... there's a lot. Like, a lot a lot. I used to want to read everything. Like, All the everything. All the Hulk, All the Flash, All the Batman, All the X-Men, and everything else... It's a massive undertaking. 

I have so many games I own but have never even looked at the opening menu too. And countless others I just will never have time for. 

Podcasts and radio shows. I mean, just keeping up to date on the Olympics. 

Wrestling. Like, yeah if you only want to keep up with WWE it's doable. Toss in AEW. Then Impact. GCW, Ring of Honor, New Japan Pro Wrestling, National Wrestling Alliance. It starts to pile up. 

Music is, a thing though. Listening to songs hundreds of times is fine. Like, lets take, well any song. How many times is enough? Watching a movie over 10 times is a lot. Only listening to a song 10 times.. well you must not like the song very much. But yes, every time you listen to a song again, it could be a new song. 

There is time for new music though. Just, pick an album and listen to it. 

I remember when I, randomly put on some of the Pointer Sisters early albums. ""The Pointer Sisters"" ""That's a Plenty"" and ""Steppin'"" are monsters. 

And I thought they had... three or four songs. Like, I'm so Excited, Jump, Automatic....

Those were the only ones I knew. (Maybe a few others, but I didn't know it was by them.) But god they had a lot of good stuff.

I have very versatile taste in music. I'm picky with artists/bands, but I'm very open minded to genres. I always tend to try to listen to new albums and new artists, but there's so much of it that I can never catch up. And even if I hear an album I often end up listening to it once or twice, and then moving on to the next even if I liked the album. So I don't have much music recently that I've formed deep connections with, it's mostly stuff that's SOLID but doesn't mean anything special to me.  I used to learn the lyrics to everything I listened to when I was younger, now I don't bother because it's just too much.   


For me I spend so much time finding bands and artists that I like, and when I find something, I spend a lot of time finding similar artists that I almost neglect getting really into that first band that I enjoyed, and when I've found a lot of artists that reminds me of the first artist, I will have moved on to being in the mood for another genre completely.

slaz78,hvpxtjn,t3_slaz78,"""This generation""? Come on, that's such bullshit. People almost never famous for their own songs until the 1950s, and it was still common to get famous off others' songs long after. And a lot of pop acts have always had (and still have) dedicated song writers who don't do any of the performance. Lack of creativity has been around forever.

A song being a cover doesn't mean it's not creative. There are a ton of covers that sound super different from the original. Even if they don't, so what? They're often done because the artist likes the song and wants to pay homage to it.

A song CLAIMING to be original when it's not is obviously uncreative. But first, that's different from a cover, and second, it's possible that they genuinely didn't know the original. There's only so many chord progressions that most people like, some are definitely going to be the same as others. Hell, there's a Wikipedia page for the [I-V-vi-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression) progression with a list of like a hundred well-known songs on it. I didn't go back and dig through your other videos to find out if that's the case with the song you're talking about, but it's common.

Finally, we live in the BEST era for music creativity. Making music has never been this cheap or accessible, and never been this easy to find an audience. Are there 10x the number of unoriginal music makers as 30 years ago? Absolutely. But there's also 20x the number of creative ones.
