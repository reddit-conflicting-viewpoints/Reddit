Pranks are like the Pepsi One of sadism. Only the person perpetrating the prank thinks it is funny. And the prakee is often left damaged or upset in some way.

For his own amusement, your husband hid an expensive medical device that your bro needs in order to function. Then enjoyed watching him freak out for hours looking for it in a panic. Finally, he gave it back broken, thus removing bro's ability to hear;  and given the cost of the item, he'll remain without his hearing until he can save up $4000 (which isn't gonna happen in our economy, especially if his income is dependent on his ABILITY TO HEAR). But he's a student, so he may not have any income to save at all. Then, when faced with the obvious and extremely logical consequence of his idiotic actions he explodes at everyone else. 

""I just wanted to enjoy an evening of mild sadism (aka prank) at your brother's expense. So what if I incidentally removed one of his fundamental senses.   I don't have to fix this problem that I alone caused because saddism/cruelty doesn't have consequences if you use a euphemism.""

Hi. First I'm gonna mention that I'm normally the one who stays with the kids ALL the time, due to being a stay at home mom. DH works full time (He's a Police Officer, have been for 5 years now) and covers night shifts. His off days are unpredictable, but I told him I needed to make an appointment with the salon to cut my hair before my sister's wedding and had only one week. I told him to let me know when he'll be available to stay with the kids but he said he doesn't know since he was swapping shifts randomly throughtout the week.

Yesterday, He came home from a nightshift at 11am and went straight to bed. I had already booked with a salon, I went to get ready then woke him up to tell him that he needed to wake up and watch the kids while I go to the salon. He refused, I kept waking him up while he kept telling me to go away. I pulled the sheets and he yelled at me to stop. I told him I was getting late for my appointment and he said that this wasn't on him and that he wasn't going to use his day off to stay awake and watch the kids. we had a fight and he ended up calling me inconsiderate and selfish because I had a goodnight sleep while he didnt, then expecting him to watch the kids on his day off. I told him those are his kids too and he needed to step up since I do this all the time. I walked out while he kept yelling at me to come back.


I returned hours later and he was right there waiting with an angry look on his face. he started arguing with me about how tired and sleep deprived he was and how selfish and awful I was to leave and force him to wake up and watch the kids on his day off over a stupid haircut. I told him it was not a big deal and he was being negative for no reason when he should be encouraging me to take care of myself. He said that I caught him off guard and ruined his day off completely, now he can't even walk without feeling dizzy and exhausted because I took away his rest time and acted selfishly.


he's been pouting since then, AITA for leaving him with the kids on his dayoff?

He needs to step up to take care of his kids.  That is a matter of being a good parent.

You need to figure out how to schedule things to respect the fact that he works overnights.  That is a matter of health and safety, both for him, because sleep deprivation is very unhealthy, and for your kids, because people who are sleep deprived have poor judgment, which can lead to accidents, short tempers, and other things that aren't good for kids.

If he's worked all night, and just got home, that is not the time to be scheduling an appointment.  

The way to have handled this would to tell him that even if he is swapping shifts, you need him to organize parenting into his life, and balance shift swapping with parenting responsibilities. 

""Sorry, I can't swap shifts, I'm watching my kids at that time"" is something he needs to tell his work.  And you need to know when in the week his schedule is set, so that once it is, you can sit down, plan around his time off, and he knows when he can and can't swap.

Also, if other people can ask him to swap for their convenience, he can ask them to swap when he has something to do.  Some balance needs to be found.",90,0,0,False,False,False,1646501214.0

Your mother's homework is not your responsibility. Furthermore, this has become a pattern - it's not like your mom needed help with one big assignment. While this one trip is the situation at hand, its part of a much bigger conversation that needs to happen about expectations and the role you all are playing in your mom's education. 

My question is: it seems like a lot of this back and forth is coming from your father. I wonder if there is an opportunity for you to safely and respectfully have an honest conversation with your mom in private, without your father there, and when she doesn't have any immediate assignments due?

I would approach it with curiosity and a lack of hostility -maybe just start by saying that she is doing something extremely challenging, exactly the way you described in your post: she's going back to school in her nonnative language, and using new technology. If you're proud of her, I'd tell her that, and that you'd like to hear what THAT experience has been like for her, if she wants to share. 

I suspect that your mom probably has a lot of complicated feelings about this, and that even if she doesn't want to talk about it, just knowing that you are there for her emotionally, not just logistically, will make a big difference. I am sure she already has a pretty good sense of how difficult this situation has been for you, and it might be hard to feel like she can be honest about her own feelings if she is carrying that guilt.

So despite the shit-talking, it took almost a decade for that to come out? Either they were doing less shit-talking than you want to admit and more just being honest about you, or they were badmouthing the hell out of you while hiding your biggest shame. Idk that seems weird to me. Coming as having been a kid in a split-custody situation where my parents couldn't stand each other, both my parents believed the other was being more harsh about them than they ever actually were.

>I said I’d still pay till she’s 18 but I’m done being a punching bag. That was 2.5 years ago and I haven’t spoken to Chloe since.

>Chloe was upset that she found out thru Facebook that I was engaged.

Next time you emotionally abandon your children, block them on Facebook.

>I texted Sarah, congratulating her on her win. Our daughter hates me and doesn’t respect me.

Way to blame your daughter finding out the truth about your cheating on your ex, btw. She didn't respect you because you were a cheater. I also bet Sarah had problems from Chloe because she hid it from her, but obvs didn't feel comfortable or willing to share her own struggles with you.


>I pay child support

This is the bare minimum requirement and not something to be praised for.

When I (36M) was 19 I was hooking up with Sarah (36F) and we got pregnant with Chloe (16F). Me and Sarah weren’t in a good spot. But we went ahead with the pregnancy. But our problems got worse. We fought constantly and weren’t intimate. I was the only one working and felt like I was being used. There was a lot of resentment and I ended up cheating when Chloe was 2. It wasn’t right at all. I should have just left. I was 21 and immature. 

We got split custody and ever since it’s been brutal with Sarah. She undermines me and wont consult me on decisions. Doesn’t stop her friends/family from shit talking me to Chloe. When Chloe was 11 she found out I cheated on her mom and has been a nightmare since. She would lock herself in her room and give me the silent treatment. She would basically only speak to me to ask when could she go back to her mom. This started at age 11 and went on for four years. Chloe kept saying horrible things to me. She banned me from attending her life events. The final straw was when I started dating again and she messaged a girl that I posted a picture with. Saying how I’m a cheater and a POS. 

After that I was done. I texted Sarah, congratulating her on her win. Our daughter hates me and doesn’t respect me. How I’m just done with it. I’m not taking Chloe anymore because I’m tired of being treated like crap. And if Chloe hates me then I don’t think it’s best she’s around me anymore. I said I’d still pay till she’s 18 but I’m done being a punching bag. That was 2.5 years ago and I haven’t spoken to Chloe since. I’ll send her a birthday card but that’s about it. 

Well about a two years ago I met Kristen (29F) and she’s amazing. We are set to get married this summer. When forming the guest list she asked about my daughter (she’s aware of the situation). I told her that we don’t have a relationship so I don’t see the need to invite her. Also it’s a special day for us and I don’t know what my daughter is capable of anymore due to Sarah. I don’t want her ruining anything or causing a scene. I thought the matter was settled. I get a call from Sarah and it’s her screaming at me. Saying Chloe was upset that she found out thru Facebook that I was engaged. I told Sarah that the relationship between us is her fault. And that she shouldn’t be surprised. Chloe got on the phone and started yelling at me. Saying I never support her anymore. I said that she banned me from her events, called me a POS everyday for 3 years so she shouldn’t be shocked that I don’t wanna be talked to like that. And that I do support her, I pay child support, I pay for her car and I pay the lions share of her private schooling. So she should watch what she says before implying that I don’t support her. The conversation started to deteriorate so I simply said “Chloe I can’t trust that you won’t do something and this is a special day for me. So if you want to re connect then maybe another time and place”. My fiancé is supportive. But I kinda feel like an AH. AITA?

Divorce sucks, and having one parent bad talk the other is horrible.

My brother made a choice, and when his son said ""I don't want to see you anymore"" my brother wrote him off. 

He was 12, when his Dad went NC. My brother did the whole, ""Poor me"" crap and made a huge deal about child support ect. He never tried to connect with his child. 

Eventually I had a long talk with my nephew and explained why his Dad was being a jackass. I didn't excuse my brother's behavior, I just explained why he was a jerk. I told my nephew when he was an adult he might consider expressing his hurt, but don't expect a relationship.

It took years of therapy and excruciating work on my brother's part from them to slowly have a relationship.

This may seem as though it's a minor situation however boyfriend took it seriously, so I'm wondering if I'm TA. Basically, what happened: boyfriend (20m) and I (19f) were playing PS5 in my room, with my brother (16m) in the other room. Mum was out with her boyfriend. We were playing, and in response to the online game we were playing my boyfriend said ""mind control is the easiest way."" No more than 2 seconds later, I could hear my brother screaming ""sponsored by the CIA"" from down the hall, and I couldn't help but laugh. My boyfriend was pissed though, and he stormed out to confront my brother. When boyfriend told brother that he disrespected him and started shit talking him, my brother responded with ""he's fucking with me subliminally."" At this point I almost died of laughter however boyfriend stormed out of the house. I later got a text from him saying that brother and I disrespected him. I thought it was a harmless joke, however he thought he was really disrespected. AITA for ""disrespecting"" my boyfriend?

Late enough this will likely get buried but I want to share my experience. Growing up, my father decided he didn't want one child to feel left out. So on my birthday he got my brother a gift and vice versa. I honestly don't remember what I might have gotten, nor being excited about my brother's birthday. In fact, now I'm questioning if I did receive anything on his birthdays. I do remember being confused and unhappy my brother, who was already the favorite because he was a boy, was getting stuff on my birthday. It was a ""sharing"" and ""make everyone happy"" situation that was forced on us for years. This and other forced ""togetherness means happiness"" things, really made it hard for me to ever feel celebrated or special. I'm grateful when I get gifts but feel unworthy and almost panicked at the attention sometimes. This also extends to compliments, even on things I know I did a legitimately great job on at work. I get flustered and have to compliment back or gift back. It's awkward sometimes and my face heats up and I then obsess over my embarrassing response and not being able to respond normally and hate the interaction. Vicious cycle of wanting to do well and be recognized, working hard to accomplish this, then panicking and feeling like an imposter when recognized. 

Everyone needs to know they are allowed to be celebrated, to be the center of attention once in a while, to do or receive special things. We deserve our own things and happiness. It can be psychologically damaging to always be lumped together and made to feel like less of an individual all the time. Feeling unheard and unseen is painful.

I own sixteen acres of woodland behind my House it is very clearly my property as there are signs up stating it is private property. I'm generally good with people walking through it taking their dog a walk or hiking or even local kids playing there as it's a safe place and beautiful and so long as they don't cause any damage or mess with the trees I see no reason to get upset over this. 

An issue came up however tonight when I was on a walk and I saw a fire through the trees I admit I panicked thinking a dog walker had been out and tossed a cigarette or some local teenagers were setting fires for fun. I rushed out to check on it and try to put out the fire and found one of my neighbours camping with their girlfriend and friends, it was a group of five people in their mid 20s and they had a roaring campfire going. 

They got startled by me rushing up to them like that and asked me what the fuck I was doing, I asked them the same question back and told them they couldn't camp here and they'd not asked permission to do so. This led to some laughter and protests that they were doing any harm and to ""Lighten up"" I told them to put the fucking fire out and get off my land, I didn't want to risk a campfire there as it could easily get out of hand especially when the group manning it were more than a little drunk.

They ended up refusing stating they weren't going anywhere and were not doing anything wrong so I went home and called the police to get them off my property, they were made to leave and break up their camp. 

Am I maybe the asshole for this? they probably thought it was ok as i'm good with letting people use my land in general, I maybe could have handled it *better* but i'd gotten a fright seeing the fire and then how they responded....it just really got to me.

You hit the nail on the head. You *aren't* expecting him to take care of you. You can take care of yourself. You know what you can afford. You are telling him what you can put in.
  
INFO: What is his current rent?
  
Also, does he currently have a hobby room?
  
I ask because, often, when two people move in together, their expenses tend to go down (sharing rent, utilities, cable, internet, etc...). 
  
Also, he expects to pay 1/3rd or more of his salary in rent *alone*?!?!
  
I earn more than he does, and I am paying slightly less than what you pay per month in rent/utilities. And his advice to you is to dip into your savings to pay rent? That's not what savings are for.
  
Don't budge. I advise having another conversation with him, and going over your finances. You don't have to combine them yet, but it would be a good idea to know if you are on the same page. I.e.: is his savings healthy? Is he saving for retirement? Does he have debts? Is he paying more rent now, and want you to go halfsies with him so he can pay less, meanwhile you pay more?

But what he's asking is for you to drown yourself financially so that he can 1. Have a nice place 2. Not have to deal with your roommates 3. Have sex in different rooms of the home 4. Disappear to his hobby room with you still at his disposal. (I'm making some inferences from my own experience dating women with roommates) 

But his attitude is unhealthy. No one should expect you to dip into savings for a regular bill.savings are for emergencies, indulgences,and retirement...not rent.

I’m currently living in a home with 4 roommates and we’re all pitching in for the rent and utilities (water, gas, electricity, internet, etc) expenses it all comes out to be around $500-$700 each. Is very affordable for my current income which is about a monthly $2,500, I’m able to live a comfortable life after paying for healthcare, car insurance, taxes and other necessities. 

Well my bf proposed that we move into together in an apartment, which I’m a bit hesitate to do so. He makes more money than me, I believe twice as much as my income monthly which is a little over $4,500. He wants to live is complete unaffordable apartment (monthly $3,000-$4,000) with me and expects me to pay 50/50 when I literally can’t afford that type of living. I explained to him that I was willing to put down 40% of my income into rent alone (comes out to be $1000), but I won’t budge from that… that if he wants to live there than he will have to pay most of the rent. Or we will go for a much cheaper option, but he wants an extra room for his own hobbies.

He got upset and told me it’s unfair that men are expected to financially take care of everything, he can’t understand why I just don’t take money out of my savings to afford that rent. He’s just asking for half on rent and he doesn’t think he’s being unreasonable. I argued that I never expected him to take care of me financially, I just simply can’t afford that type of living. We definitely have a major difference of income and he can’t expect me to afford everything that he can afford. That I would be willing to pitch in rent for 40% of my income, if he’s unwilling to budge from 50/50 then we’ll have to find a more affordable apartment room to fit my price range. If not then I’m abandoning the idea of moving together, I’m fine with living with my roommates and occasionally crashing over at his current place. 

Am I being unreasonable?! I mean I just can afford that place with my current income!

I am well aware that this is a very controversial post so I'm not going to state my religion. 

I was born into a religion and because my mom got remarried to someone with a different religion, my mom and I converted. I was around 11 when I converted and I obviously didn't have any say in it. My name, school, city, clothes changed. I felt trapped. 

When I turned 15 i told my mother that she could do what ever she wants but if she forces anything on me, I will go live with my dad while she could be a good dumb wife to her husband. This worked out and everything stopped. I also asked her to Change my name but she said I could do it after I turn 18 because my school life will be affected so I agreed. 

My friend (I'll call her M) and I became friends when I changed schools. I made three other friends and we pretty much had a great time together. They were very supportive of me wanting to change back to my past self. M belonged to the same religion (the one I converted to). I would never really have conversations about the bullshit I had to go through because it would hurt her. She only knew that I wanted to change my name. 

It's finally Time and my school would be ending in 2 months (My school year would be from July to March but got extended to April) and I'll turn 18 in August. So everything is going by the plan. M somehow got to know about the fact that I wanted to leave due to religious trauma. My other friend blurted it out. M got mad. 

She started telling me that I'm making mistakes by changing. She tried to convince me by reading verses from her holy book and translating it. I just told her that I don't want to offend her but she needs to keep her stuff to herself. She does the same bullshit and would tell me the horrifying ways I'm going to die. She crossed the line 3 days ago. She had the audacity to Call my mom and ask her to not let me do it. She told her that I'm converting back for the wrong reasons and my mom's going to go to hell if she lets me sin. My mom shut her down and told her that I'm the one who'll pay for my sins and it doesn't concern her. M calls my stepdad too.

I called up M crying. Told her that she needs to shut the fuck up before I complain about her to the school. I told her that I'll complain to the principal that she calls my parents when they don't want to have conversations with her and doesn't leave me alone. My friends tried to convince me not to complain but after some days I did because I was scared my mom will change her mind on helping me out. 

M's parents have been called to meet the principal. My friends aren't speaking to me because they believe that M's behavior didn't affect my plans but my complaint against her will have her grounded and her parents will be really strict with her. 

I understand how bad this is going to affect M but if her behavior affects my mom, my whole life will be ruined. So AITA?

I knitted a pair of baby boots and we took a picture of him and I standing in our boots (just of our lower ankles) with the baby boots saying Baby (bf's last name), Apprenticeship starting August 2022. We thought it was cute as we both got to where we are through apprenticeships and I guess growing up is just the apprenticeship to life. 

Now I'll be happy if my future child is blue collar, white collar, pink collar, I do not care at all what my child does so long as they aren't harming anyone. We posted it on our social media pages and I put my phone down as I figured it would be nothing crazy. Before long we have family and friends posting that it is disgusting that we are forcing our unborn child to live the 'back breaking' life we do. After a little bit I decided to take down the post and upload a picture of the ultrasound saying (last name) baby due August 2022, since it didn't seem worth the drama. But I am curious if it came off as assholeish and us wanting the child to be blue collar and not accepting anything else.

My sister came to visit and she had some things do do with my mom. My mom is selling her house and is moving to something smaller without stairs. 
My sister and I have a rocky relationship since childhood and always said I was the favorite. I only got a good job because my parents supported me more. 
My nephew Adam 13 went out with me and my kids ages 5&9. We went to get burgers at sit down burger place. My 5 year old is going through the stage of being picky and plain cheese burgers or nuggets will keep him happy. 
We set down and the kids ordered a shakes. 
My nephew made a face at the menu and said I could afford to take him out for steaks. I basically treated him like I would treat my own kids and told the server to put the shakes in a to go cup and we are leaving. 
Adam was silent on the way home but my sister got mad and screamed at me on how I treated Adam like a child (because he is an acted like one) my wife thinks I did the right thing. My mom said I could have handled it better. My sister and Adam think I’m Satan because I didn’t get Adam food when I said I would take him out for lunch. My sister said I starved him and they had to go get something right then and there. I just treated Adam how I would have treated my kids. Actually probably a little bit nicer because if my kids acted like that I wouldn’t have let them have the milkshake.

Long story short (F)39 married to (M)42 for 19 years before we got divorced (This was a Muslim Arranged marriage), we have 4 Kids (F)13,(M)15,(F)16 (Twins).  
 

before we got divorced I had found his mobile phone and seen some strange messages from someone with some explicit comments about nights out and how they are looking forward to meeting up next, (name on the phone was generic alexi), I left the phone on the bed and went and spoke to a friend of mine the next day who also knew my husband and said he would find out who this Alexi was after work, turns out Alexi was a man and my husband had been having an affair with him (this was outside their workplace and they were co-workers)  
 

confronted my husband and he told me that the only reason he married me was to get his parents and family off his back and that he had been seeing other men over the years (Alexi for the last 3 and half years), he said it was a relief that he could finally tell me and that he wanted me to stay with him so his family would not cut him off along with the kids.

Kicked him out and filed for divorce, the divorce took a few months and he did fight it and tried to keep the marriage intact (this was a sham marriage from the start) at one point he told me not to tell the kids why this was happening and just tell them that our marriage was not working out, I told him they have a right to know and told them about the affairs and the reason, his parents asked me and I told the truth.  
 

His family have disowned him his extended family have disowned him and his kids will not speak to him. (he can’t return to his country as Homosexuality is against the law and he risks being arrested)  
 

He told me I have ruined his life and that he has no family anymore and he is on his own.  
 I told him its not my problem as he has used me for then 19 years and that I that I was nothing more than an instrument to keep his family at bay because of his sexuality.  
 

His friends have called me an asshole for exposing him to his family and community and making him an outcast to everyone that he cared about and making his kids resent him and want nothing to do with him.

I’ll be nice and break it down to every single Y-T-A and E-S-H commenter out there, because they have clearly not understood the story!

**A) Your ex-husband’s sexuality.**

_It is the sad truth that people from a country like this have to face such consequences for being gay, but 
This is Not a free card for ex-husband to just get to cheat on Op._

_That’s on Ex-husband for making the choice to cheat on her instead of saying the truth in advance. If he was honest from the start, then I would agree that Op is wrong. He played a stupid game, and won a stupid prize._

**B) Outing isn’t ok, no matter the circumstances.**

_So outing someone isn’t ok, but lying to them is? And not just lying to them, this has been a 2 decade lie. This was half of Op’s life that was a total lie, and this was half of Op’s Ex-husband’s life having things go his way._

_Outing isn’t ok, but in this case are you guys claiming that lying to someone for half a lifetime is any better?_

**C) You got him into a possible “get killed” situation.**

_The most laughable of them all. Op did not do this, and this is all on the husband. For 19 years he knew the consequences of his actions, but he kept risking this and now that he got caught he’s mad about it._

_This isn’t Op’s fault. This is on the ex-husband for risking the chances of getting caught, and karma just finally put him in his place._

TL;DR my estranged mother wrote an obviously fake review under my name for her own book, which praises the parenting styles that ruined our relationship. WIBTA for asking her to take it down? 

My mom wrote a book about parenting when I was about 17, with some personal narratives and advice in it-- think ""battle hymn of the tiger mother"" type of stuff. Today I went to look at its Amazon reviews out of curiosity, and found a review under my name from 2014, praising the book and the views expressed within it. I did not write this review. My mother and I have had an incredibly fraught relationship since I was a teenager, and several of the parenting ""techniques"" that this book and the review praise are part of the reason that we barely talk, including her obsession with controlling my sexuality, weight and gender presentation. 

I know this is a fake review written by her because: 

* While it's only under a first name, it's my deadname (I'm trans). This name is extremely uncommon and I have never met or heard of another person who shares the same name with the same spelling. 
* The username for the review is Name\_1 and that user has no other reviews.
* The review is basically just the blurb on the back of the book, with some compliments thrown in. It's a very transparently ""written by the author"" review. 
* The review was posted within 3 days of the book being listed on Amazon. 

I feel extremely uncomfortable with this review remaining up, and I'm insulted by the fact that she thought it was appropriate to just use my name to review a book praising her for her abusive behaviors, but I know that if I bring it up to my mother it will cause a MASSIVE fight as she'll immediately ask me if I really hated her parenting style that much, and I don't want to cause more tension than we already have.

I think I might be TA because: the review is from 2014 and isn't hurting anybody, I still went by my deadname back then, and I don't want to start a huge fight over something so insignificant.

I (20F) have a younger brother, “Jacob” (17). He’d been in a relationship with Lana (also 17) for a little over a year.

My family and I thought Lana was nice. She used to come over to our house a lot and it was clear that her and Jacob really liked each other. But like most teenagers, their relationship just went sour after a while.

Jacob and I are very close, so he told me everything that was happening. According to him, Lana just started telling him that he wasn’t attractive anymore, which then turned into her making remarks at the way he did everything. I was thinking she just had ‘the ick’ and told him to give her some space for a while.

He followed my advice and they didn’t speak for about two weeks until she randomly turned up on our doorstep at 1am. 

Neither me, Jacob, or our parents knew why she was there or why she didn’t call in advance to let us know she was coming, (she has all of our mobile numbers… a heads-up at 1am would’ve been nice). She said nothing to any of us, just barged into the doorway and started yelling at Jacob like a monster while we were all half-asleep. 

It wasn’t just like… shouting. It was like some argument out of Wattpad. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it in my life. It was insane to witness. There was no expression on her face at all, she was just screeching and swearing and calling him names. All I could think of the entire time was, “what the fuck is happening?” 

I snapped and told her to get the fuck out of our house or I was calling the cops. My mom immediately told me to be quiet, but I was so raging angry that I completely ignored her and just steered Lana out of the house and onto the street.

I went straight back to bed without saying a word to anyone. But in the morning, I found a voicemail on my phone that “Ellen”, one of Lana’s moms, had left for me. In it, she said that she’d found Lana crying in her bedroom. Lana had told her that she’d snuck out of the house early in the morning to talk to Jacob, and that I had bullied and berated her when she came to the door. I was basically chewed out and told that at my age, I should’ve helped Lana, regardless of whether her and my brother were on good terms or not, and that kicking her out of the house was unacceptable. (Pretty clear that Lana had not told the truth whatsoever but I couldn’t be asked to care at that point. Plus, I had witnesses, so I’m not about to fight with her mom about the truth when my whole family can back me up). 

Despite all the lies, I can’t help but feel a little guilty about it now. This is a hormonal teenage girl we’re talking about. She was probably just acting on impulse. She’s also somebody that my family knows, and I’d never known her to act that way before (apart from being a little high-maintenance). I’m starting to wonder whether I should’ve tried to calm her down instead of just kicking her out. 

AITA?

My friends have a 20 month old daughter, and My SO and I have a 15 month old son. Over the last 6-8 months or so, every time we go to their home or they come to ours we end up getting extremely sick and it lasts 10-20 days. Each time this has happened my son ends up losing weight because he can’t keep food or liquids down, he runs fevers over 103°F, and usually struggles to sleep because he can’t breathe well.
They always insist that they weren’t sick at any point and don’t think they are the cause, but I’m pretty certain. We stayed away from them for 2 months and in that time we only did play dates with family. In those 2 months he didn’t get sick at all. So, 2 weeks ago we invited our friends and their daughter over for a play date, and sure enough our son got sick. He’s been struggling with it for going on 15 days now. They text me earlier today asking if they can come over for a play date this weekend and I responded back by saying that we no longer wanted to have play dates with them because we knew it meant that our son and our whole household would end up sick for majority of the month. 
They were very offended and said that I was placing blame on them without proof that it is them causing the problem. They also were seemingly trying to guilt me by saying that our son is the only friend their daughter has and it’s not fair. I tried explaining that this only happens when hanging out with them and that I have to base my decision on that. Now they think ITA because “kids just get each other sick, that’s what they do”. I know kids get each other sick occasionally, but every single time they interact seems like too much and it just doesn’t seem worth it to me. So, did I over-react? AITA?

I just don't think you can assume the kind of malice or negligence you seem to be implying here. Particularly if they aren't sick and their kid isn't sick before or after the play date.

If each of these things are happening every couple of weeks over the span of 6 months, then you're basically always either actively sick or in the immediate aftermath of a play date. That doesn't mean one is causing the other. It just means they both happen a lot and you're reaffirming your own conclusion a lot.

I’ve been with my significant other for 13 years, we just got married this year. We have 2 children together and 2 from previous relationships. I have always said I will not change my name if I got married. 
During the wedding process which I admit was not complicated l, but he did not help at all. I made all the appointments, found a place to do a virtual marriage counseling, found a place for the ceremony, etc. He said he would drop off the marriage license to the courthouse a few days after the ceremony. I said ok, make you look it over to see if I missed anything (because I filled it out). He dropped it off, didn’t say anything. We were married in February, yesterday while making a joke he says ok Mrs. (Insert his name here), I’m like LOL, I didn’t change my name. Im still (insert my name here). Now he’s extremely upset I didn’t change my name. Yet I never told him I was changing name. I explained that to him and he says I know but I thought you were going to hyphenate it. I also want to add that my oldest daughter just turned 18 and is the process of changing her last name to mine (because her father isn’t in her life). Another reason I want to keep my last name is for her to feel like she belongs.
Also changing my last name will require an extreme amount of tedious work that I honestly don’t want to do, our younger children have special needs and I handle everything for them. I don’t want to add in having to go to the social security office, bank, health insurance, etc to change my name. It might seem insignificant but it’s just another thing added to the list.
I could always hyphenate my name but I didn’t think it was a big deal since he never said anything about it before? Am I the asshole for not changing my last name?

My daughter has recently started dating a guy named “Jack,” and I honestly don’t see why she’s with him. They ran into each other while she was on a walk solo (seriously, how is this not weird or creepy) and he randomly asked for her number. 

She’s told me that Jack wants to be a professional chef with his own business and that if it doesn’t work out, that he’ll go back to school for a degree in psychology to be a therapist. Right now, he works at restaurants. 

That seems unstable to me and I told her that and she said “I make enough for both of us,” and other things like “He understands me and isn’t afraid to show his feelings” and “is always affectionate to me, compliments my looks and tried to flirt with me all the time though we’re dating.” And of course, he apparently “cooks for her and taught her how.”

That is all fine and dandy but secondary to the fact he’s not realistic about his career. I have been married for almost 25 years and I know that love isn’t enough to compensate for financial problems and other life issues. I’ve tasted what he made and it’s better than my cooking but I’m sure not many are professional chefs. 

I also reminded her that she’s moving away in 4 months and that Jack lives here more permanently. They’ll be an hour away by plane and 6-7 hours away by car. 

I suggested that she just break it off and move on because long distance relationships don’t typically survive and because he’s not worth it and my daughter replied with “But I love him” nonsense and now is mad at me. 

Jack then tried to call me and tell me that he wanted to “talk to me about his career and life plans” so I could feel more reassured and I hung up on him. So ridiculous.

Ill be honest an hour long flight away from eachother doesn't seem that far to me. I'm probably biased, as my husband is currently stationed in Germany and its a 10 hour flight and i haven't seen him sense last year, but long distance relationships are feasible. 

Love might not be enough to get through a lot of lifes challenges but it is vital to having a successful relationship long distance or not.

I've had the same tenants in my investment property for almost four years now. They are the perfect tenants. While we're not friends by any means, we are quite friendly. A few years back my sister Amy came with me as I unlocked the door for their daughter who locked herself out. Last week Amy ran into the husband and wife at a Meetup.com organised dinner. While I'm unaware of the specifics, the short of it was that Amy found out that the couple were homophobic. Specifically, the couple believes that marriage is strictly between men and women.

Let me state unequivocally that I believe my tenants' opinion is disgusting. As does Amy. In fact, she's finds their opinion so repulsive that she *insists* that I kick them out of the property. For context, in my jurisdiction, you are only allowed to kick out long term tenants for a limited set of reasons. One such reason is that an immediate family member is to move in after the tenants vacate the property. My sister is so sickened by my tenants' opinion that she's willing to move in, pay the same rent, just so I can kick the family out. 

Is that just not a little bit over the top? Amy didn't think so. That I think so was enough for my sister to turn her anger towards me, and accuse me of supporting bigotry. Can I get a reality check here? Is Amy crazy, or AITA?

Getting all self-righteous in the brother's face and then walking away, leaving the brother to take out his anger on the wife and kids he was going home with?  You're not as much of an AH as your brother, but you're definitely one.

ESH (aside from the poor wife and kids).

Let me be clear: I'm 100% on board with the idea that the SIL is being abused on multiple levels.  However, getting in an abuser's face, berating them about their abuse, and then feeling good about how you told them off, while watching them walk away with their abuse victim, is even worse than just staying silent.

Either STFU or go all-in.  Half-assing it just leaves the abuse victim worse off, because you've forced them to deal with the aftereffects.

I have an older brother who's the breadwinner while his wife a stay at home mom to 3 kids. As far as I know and from my SiL's complaints, He doesn't do anything to contribute to childcare or household chores.


I live at my parents house for now after I lost my wife very recently to Cancer, And last night My brother brought his family for dinner. It all started when my brother was berating his wife for not ironing his suit jacket properly, I watched while he went on a long rant about how lazy and irresponsible she was (yes infront of the kids who seemed terrified but no one said anything) I asked that he stop but he didn't. SiL then told him she was too busy with the kids and cleaning and said he should've got it done himself. he looked at her and said ""I'm a doctor, I'm out there working hard to save people's lives, what do you do all day?"" My SiL was almost crying because he yelled at her. I got involved and said ""You know it's kind of funny that you have the ability  to save people's lives while not having the ability to get a single chore done which is getying your suit ironed in this instance"". He looked at me stunned, Clearly what I said pissed him off because, he just up and went to the bathroom, Minutes later they left. My parents went off on me telling me I shouldn't have spoken to my older brother like this and meddled in his marital issues. I asked mom if she was fine with her son talking to her DiL like that infront of his parents and kids, I know I wouldn't dream of treating my wife like this nomatter what. She said still, It wasn't my place to get involved because my brother is venting and is frustrated because, he's doing all he can and his wife was the one at fault here.

My wife's best friend ""Vanessa"" and her husband ""James"" were convicted of serious fraud a few days ago and will be sentenced in a couple of weeks.

It's possible that as part of their sentence, they'll have much of what they purchased using the illegal money taken away. This includes their cars and some pieces of art that they own. 

Vanessa also has a lot of expensive clothes. She claims to have shopped ""all over the world"" and their house has whole rooms full of her shoes and dresses. 

While they've both accepted that their previous lifestyle is over and that they're both facing a long time in prison, Vanessa doesn't want to let go of her wardrobe. 

Because of my job (construction) I own a van. Vanessa asked my wife if they could borrow it. She wants to put her clothes in my van and for me to drive it somewhere far away and store it. They've figured that while the cars are traceable by the police so they can't keep those, Vanessa's clothes aren't traceable so they can get away with keeping those. She wants to keep them for when she gets out of prison.

I told my wife that I would not be taking part in something that could potentially get us both arrested. She responded that the clothes aren't being monitored and the risk of the police coming after us is tiny. She then said I was cruel for not wanting to help a woman who is looking at years in prison. 

I don't think it's cruel at all. Even if it's a tiny risk, its still a risk. My wife and I have jobs and two children to provide for. Trouble with the police could ruin all of our lives.

I went through a very similar situation with my sister and makeup, I have sensitive skin to the point where if the wind blows the wrong way I'm an acne covered cherry tomato. 

Through trial and error I found a few brands of makeup I could tolerate, of course they were higher end and stupid expensive because why not, so I had built up a small collection to use for special events paid for by my part time job. 

My sister is 10 years younger so when she took makeup from my room to play with when I was 16 she thoroughly mashed it. Every pan dust, all the liners sharpened to the nub, mascara left open and dried, concealer, foundation both emptied and smeared all over my makeup case. 

The first time it happened, I told her why I was upset and was diplomatic. Figured I'd get further than lashing out but I was mad. I went to my parents so they could discipline her appropriately, I'm a sibling not a parent, and they did absolutely nothing. She got a, leave your sister alone, and that was it. No comment on replacement, not even a time out, nothing. 

So I move on, salvage what I can and repurchase the basics. Wouldn't you know it, after zero consequences she waited until I was away for a weekend and did the same thing. I didn't bother talking to her that time and went straight to my parents. Again nothing, no consequences. 

I asked for a lock on my room, no locked doors in this house. I asked for them to replace what she ruined, nope you need to look after your own things better. I said maybe just get some play makeup for her if she's clearly interested, nope she's too young for that. I hid it somewhere new, she'd wait and go through my room until she found the new hiding spot. Why not, no consequences and now it's a game. 

That went on for about a month before I lost it, went to the garage and got the drill, then stole the latch of our garden gate and screwed that to my door frame and tossed on a padlock. My Dad was livid, and said that my next pay check was going towards the damage.  I then handed him an itemized invoice for my makeup and said I'll take it out of your damages owed. 

They were decidedly very not happy with me but it was totally worth it. A 6 year old thinking it's ok to go through others rooms is unacceptable and needs correcting. Aside from not learning to respect others spaces, I was 16, there was worse contraband in there in the good spots that I really didn't want her finding. 

At 12 sure she's a kid but she's old enough to understand what belongs to her and what doesn't. I'm all for age appropriate discipline, that's how you prevent people from growing up to be boundary-less monsters. This really isn't about the bath bombs, it doesn't matter what the item is, it's about respecting others. 

I'd be sticking to your opinion with your parents, no consequences is not the way to go here, but that isn't your role to take on, it has to be them. It sets the precedence for all future taking of your personal items.

You are legally an adult. Your sister is 12. If the bath bombs are so precious to you, find somewhere safe and locked to keep them. 

Plus, you can't really prove she did it. ""My brothers can't reach he cabinet and think bath bombs are gross girly things"" doesn't mean anything.  As far as we know, they climbed on top of chairs or other things and had fun throwing them down the toilet after pooping because colourful poop is funny. Who knows? You weren't there. And with kids, if they aren't supervised 100% of the time (which is essentially impossible) and things aren't locked away, they are withing reach. 

Plus, either way, you're still missing the point that your sister is 12. She is a kid, she is going through a stage in her development that makes it more difficult to control her emotions, even if she did it, yelling at her over bath bombs is the wrong approach. It doesn't even matter if she did it or not. She will not get how important they are to you, she will only hear that you and your mom care more about an object than you care for her. She will feel left out, she will feel unloved, and she will turn that frustration into anger towards you and your mom. Your dad, however, will be her go to person.

t6x7vt,hzfx8d9,t3_t6x7vt,"*Ten* missing? That’s not only wanton waste; it’s deliberate, calculated cruelty. Your sister did this on purpose because she feels you get more attention because you are unwell. She needs support, but that needs to start with taking responsibility and acknowledging how mean she was. Your parents should pay for the new bombs, not her, because this is a cry for attention - a hugely spiteful one, and at 12 she’s far too young to become this vindictive. ~~N-T-A~~

Edit: you should also acknowledge that screaming is not okay. Your bath bombs are precious to you, yes, but that’s not an appropriate reaction in any case. You will have only reinforced your sister’s feelings that she is second best if it’s okay for you to scream at her, and if this is a regular occurrence. It sounds like you have some stresses in your life but you should still cultivate compassion for others. Your sister has feelings and stresses too. For your own sake as well, you shouldn’t want to become someone whose temper makes others afraid. Honestly I think both you and your sister need some therapy on ways to regulate your emotions and communicate a grievance. Neither her destroying 10 bath bombs, nor you screaming at her, is a healthy way to resolve rivalry between you. It’s also not fair for your little brothers to grow up around this negativity - it will mean they struggle with relationships in later life.

ETA: I’m going to have to change this to ESH on seeing that OP is 18 and old enough to know that screaming at a child is not okay in any circumstances. I’m not judging you because I’d probably have done the same, and your father made it worse by saying they were ‘just bath bombs’, but losing your temper like that while she is at a developmental age can really traumatise someone, and it really is not okay to do that over bath bombs. You sound like you have a lot of idiosyncrasies and demand they are respected and everyone has to tiptoe around you. Your sister is obviously sick of it and hit out where it hurts. This is your parents’ fault, and again, they should pay for it and offer some support to your sister because it’s their failure to keep your temper in check around your siblings that has led to this outburst.

English is not my first language and I'm on mobile, so sorry for mistakes.

So I (f19) recently went out to eat with a group of classmates. We get along but arent close. We just finished an assigment and to celebrate.

I have some dietary restrictions. I don't eat onion unless it's in small amounts, it makes me vomi. I also don't eat lamb, veal and game. I don't eat rabbit meat, horse meat and octopus. I don't eat anything I saw alive.

So we're all seated in the restaurant, there's five of us and the atmosphere is great. And then our food is brought to us. I ordered some pasta. Classmate no. 1 ordered lamb. No. 2 ordered game. No. 3 ordered onion soup. No. 4 got a risotto. 

When we worked on the project, we ordered takeout few times. Every time, we tasted eachothers dishes. Everyone was totally fine with that, no one was ever pressured to share nor to taste. And in the restaurant, naturally everyone wanted to share too. But I could taste only the risotto. When one person questioned me about suddently refusing to taste food from everyone but no. 4, I explained my reasons. I never brought them up before because it wasn't relevant. 

Two people just went ""ok, cool"", the onion soup person made sure that their food isn't making me feel uncomfortable/sick. But the other two got really offended. They said that it's really rude that I'm tasting food from only one person and since it's not a health issue, I can eat a little game and lamb. They said that I'm not a vegetarian, so what's the problem. 

I still refused to taste their food. All of them were welcome to try my pasta, but I wouldn't eat their meat beacuse of my personal values. 

Everyone dropped the topic, but the atmosphere was ruined. After we left the restaurant, the lamb and game people told me that they won't ever eat with me again beasuse they felt offended that I excluded them and they felt judged. This couldn't be further from truth! I don't judge anyone and I had a reason to exclude them.

Well, I don't think that I'm in wrong, but those two people are really making me start questioning it. After all, I did exclude them is sone way and eating their food would've made me feel bad only mentally, I wouldn't be physically harmed.

So, AITA for not tasting their food and excluding those two people? They're acting really hurt and ignoring me in school.

I am a woman in what used to be, and in some ways still is a bit of a boys club mentality profession. My husband is in the same profession. 

He worked with this amazing woman, many moons ago. At some point, she started to take over some of his managerial responsibilities and she would tell him about issues she was having with some of the male members of the team. This was surprising to him because he’d never experienced that with the same members. 

Pre zoom, it wasn’t always possible to see exactly who was on a call. He started joining some of the calls in silent mode - and observed that she was, indeed right. They had an edge when they spoke with her. He got to experience first hand, what I as his wife had been telling him for about 3+ years at that point, with someone who worked with him. 

I won’t call you an AH yet simply for your ignorance. But I will respectfully warn you. Do not minimize your wife’s concerns. She experienced life at work very differently than people you socialized with. Their interactions are different. To this day, I work with people I agree are great drinking buddies but I want to punch them when I have a professional interaction with them.

My husband is a great guy and works in STEM. He has, over the past couple of years, started to pick up on the sexism in his workplace. It's subtle. It's talking over the women more often in meetings - he admits he has to catch himself from doing it too because the women are so used to it that they let it happen, whereas men wouldn't let someone interrupt without going back to their point. It's thinking the female boss is being mean for a decision she makes, trying to go to my husband instead (which undermines her authority) and taking it better when my husband says exactly the same thing. Again, it has taken him time to recognise that pattern and work out how behave so he is not inadvertently adding to the problem. And those are just the things he can see, after years of exposure to it and working alongside about 50% women. The women it's happening to probably can't even recognize what the causes are since innocent behaviour of non-sexist colleagues like my husband are adding to their problems.

The most sympathetic ear you could find. he obviously was sort of paying attention to these things and was stunned by most of what I’ve pointed out. I have never complained to my husband and only to very close friends about “sexism” in the workplace, as it’s all fairly minor. Here are a few examples of things you absolutely wouldn’t notice while golfing or at a Christmas party: 

- a new job opens up and it’s a technical role. It needs to be filled immediately from the existing pool of engineers. There is no time to do interviews, just for management to walk through and pick someone for the new task. Males are generally chosen. 
- I went on maternity leave and when I came back my position had been changed to one that is more administrative. I have a masters in mech eng while many of my coworkers only have bachelors.  There was no discussion about “do you want a lighter role while you’re getting used to motherhood?” Just an assumption. 
- that administrative role is in a team with more than half of the women in the department. We’re all grouped up together. I expressed concern that we may not be taken as seriously as our management has had a history thinking this sort of thing is superfluous (although it’s becoming necessary with the expanded projects) and having us all be women wouldn’t work well for the subconscious of the generally male teams we work with. I was shut down immediately on that (no one would think that!). People constantly assume I am not an engineer. 
- Did a coworker have a baby? Did a family member die? Are we doing a potluck? Who should get the card, put together a lunch reservation, coordinate dishes to bring? I think whatever woman is within eyesight. Will this take time away from your other responsibilities? Yes. Will it get any appreciation at the end of the year? Of course not it’s party planning anyone could do it in their sleep (well then why don’t you ever do it?) 
- in lockdown, I think we’ve hired 50 people. I can think of one or two who are women, the rest are men. All men went to technical roles, all women more towards softer skills. They are all engineers with similar backgrounds. 
- all of this contributes to when you get promoted. Our product cycle is long, so you’re probably going to stay in your role for a number of years until you can move somewhere else. You can try to move earlier, but generally can’t within the same department. This means when your product cycle is up, that’s a common time for promotion. If you have been in a technical role for the last several years? You are much more likely to be promoted or monetarily rewarded (high performers get higher bonuses and raises - they are more likely to go to technical roles, which are more likely to be men).

All of my coworkers (well I mean there are bad apples, but most) are great friends and happy coworkers. I am slowly getting outpaced by my peers in terms of compensation and future job prospects. The new fathers in my group are often monetarily rewarded (statistically consistent across the industry) and I absolutely have not been. It’s so frustrating and it makes me want to be less of a contributing member to my group. I am trying to put my extra energy into projects that have fun thesis statements (saved $xx, hired ___, enacted ___) so that I’ll have a bomb resume in a few years and can either get promoted within the company or elsewhere.

My youngest brother ""Jay"" and I grew up as rivals. I'm the first to admit that I was pretty bad to him growing up. My mother would have a kid, be her favorite, then be replaced by another kid. She'd tell you she couldn't do things for you yet turn around and do it for the kid who replaced you. Whether it was money, car or braces. My situation with my brother was unique in the sense that I was had been working since 16 and helping my mom out just to find out that my money was being used to help my other siblings. That's where my hostility towards my brother came from.

All of my siblings got married and had kids except for me. I have relationships with some but not others. I probably wouldn't have a relationship with them if it weren't for their kids. I'm the ""funcle"" and my siblings appreciate that I'm the uncle that we wished we had growing up.

Jay made it clear that he didn't want me to have a relationship with my nephew. He still hated me. I understood so whatever. 

Then came a situation where he and his wife were priced out of their dream home and asked our mom for financial help. She delivered BUT my brother and his wife found out that it was me who fronted the money to my mom to help them. From that point on, we became more cordial and I developed a relationship with my nephew ""Nicky"" who is now 7.

Over the last year or so, it seems like he and especially his wife kept on having money issues. Little things here and there that were a drop in the bucket to me. The last time I saw them his wife made a comment about how expensive gas was but it worth it because Nicky and I got to spend time together.

It rubbed me the wrong way because it made it seem like they went out of their way for me to see Nicky. Actually they went to visit our mother to pick up hand me downs and Amazon packages that she ordered. I just dropped by and now he and his wife want me to give them money too.

They didn't need gas money. It was just to see if I'd give them $20. That pissed me off. I didn't and stopped giving my mom money too. All of a sudden they had issues with me and freezing me out. 

The breaking point was when they said they would not come over if I was at my mom's. My brother started bringing up how mean I was the him growing up. I clapped back by telling him that it was more like he was trying to monetize my relationship with Nicky. 

I haven't spoken to any of them in five months. They're still having money issues too.

I (26F) and my partner (27M) recently got engaged after 10 years together. We are an interracial couple and he comes from a wealthy White family. His parents no matter what Ive done to advance my life (I was valedictorian, had straight As in college, medical school) have always looked down upon me for being Black. They felt like I came from a poor “broken home” and didnt feel like I was the right fit for their son.(Also, for reference my future sister in law’s fiance is an absolute bum but because hes from a similar background of white and wealthy they adore him)

They outright did not like me in college and now have outwardly accepted me for the sake of their son. They still make side comments such as suggesting I only got into medical school because I am Black, but brag about it to their friends.

With our recent engagement it came out that they are paying for his sister’s wedding—her fiance’s family has offered to split it as well but because its their daughter they said theyd pay for it entirely. 

In trying to figure out our budget my fiance casually asked if his Mom knew his sisters budget. She got very defensive and asked if it was appropriate for us to have similar budgets considering my family’s inability to pay. Confused, he probed further and discovered that they felt like it was shameful that my family had not saved for a wedding for me and felt my family was not smart with their money.

My fiance and I have no expectation of his family paying and have told them we plan to pay for it ourselves. They believe because my family is poor that I dont deserve a standard wedding (we’re literally looking at barns, not the Ritz) because I cannot contribute as much as my fiance and that we should elope. I have lived through ten years of emotional abuse from his parents that I will not recount here but lets just say all of it would not fly now that I am older but 16 year old me was much more naive. 

I told my fiance that we should get married for just us. If there is going to be so much drama and should elope, but that if his parents continue to bash mine that I do not want his parents there. I offered that mine did not need to be there either. Weddings celebrate joining of families and I feel like his have no respect for mine. I cannot in good conscience pretend that we are joining our families when his has proven time and time again to be racist and prejudice.

My fiance says that we have to come to some sort of compromise instead and that he absolutely has to have his parents there. We’re now at an impasse. AITA?

I was walking around with just my nursing bra and pants on because I’m about to go pump after a snack. My MIL sees me and tells me that I need to work out and exercise because I still look “5 months pregnant”. (PS. I honestly don’t think so, I’m basically almost back to pre pregnancy shape/weight, skin is still working on getting there, and I was never THAT big - 5’5’’, 135-140 pounds, not a gym rat nor a couch potatoe and my fat is evenly spread out).

I’m 5 weeks post partum. I turned to her and said, “If this is 5 month post partum, when are you delivering?”.

She got royally pissed… Also went off about how she took time to come help us and this is the appreciation she gets. :/ (which, is kinda true but she’s been making these small remarks here and there for a while).

Normally, I would have been better at holding my tongue, but honestly, at 8 am with 2-3 hours of sleep last night, it just slipped out.

Was I an AH for calling my MIL fat and pregnant?

Starting off by saying that I’m 15. Yesterday my dads gf (39) and her son (12) was over and her son wanted to go on a golf cart ride on my golf cart. That is a thing that is special to just me and my dad so I told her that I didn’t want to go with them. She kept insisting that I come with them but I just kept telling her that I just want to stay here. 

Eventually she asked why so I just told her the truth which was “I was going to wait for you guys to leave so I can go on a golf cart ride with my dad” and she was PISSED. She left the room and went outside followed by her son and my dad. Apparently she started crying and she thinks I hate her now. 

My dad comes back in and calls me an AH and that I was “rude” and a “jerk”. She comes back in and gives me a dirty look and says “we’re leaving”. She’s still new and I’m not very comfortable with either of them yet, both her and my dad know this. I honestly feel bad and definitely think I worded it wrong, so maybe I’m the AH.

When my wife wanted to get a dog, I said yes but told her that the dog wasn't allowed on our bed because I viewed the bed as our 'private space' and she agreed. 

She went and adopted a dog and things have been fine.last night though, the dog jumped up and I began to tell if no but my wife shushed me and said that it really isn't a big deal, I told her that I didn't want the dog sleeping up here and she told me that the dog just loves us so much and told me not to be a jerk. 

I reminded her of our deal, so she told me that not letting the dog sleep on the bed was cruel and that dog beds must not be very comfortable and she just loves to cuddle with him so much. So I got up and she asked where I was going and I told her - I wasn't going to sleep with a dog that spent the better part of the day traipsing in dirt and stepping in shit and God knows what else and was going to drool on me and take up about 50% of the bed, so I was going to sleep somewhere else. 

So I slept on the floor in our kids' room. Come this morning, my wife is angry at me. She thinks that I behaved I'm maturely and childishly and that her request was harmless and the dog just wanted to cuddle. 

Am I the asshole?

I love them dearly, but my dad and stepmom would always cram all our birthdays into one giant party for the three of us because all our birthdays are in December, and to save money. I was always forgotten, pretty much, in all these parties. I barely got any gifts. Mostly because it was mostly my stepmom's friends, and they only seemed to care about the babies. They were always polite they were never family friends to me as my dad and his family. I just felt like the tacked- on mistake attached to the picture. I never had a sweet 16. But my stepmom made a giant deal out of my eighteenth birthday, and I asked her and my dad for my own birthday party. I didn't care if it was a huge thing or just something small, like a pizza party or a small get together with cake and generic soda. And I told them so too. They proceeded to rent a venue and promised me a big, giant birthday party, just for me. The place was decked out with balloons, and they hired a caterer and professional dj. She even bulk ordered some souvenir centerpieces. She ordered my dress that I absolutely loved. The day of the party, and I noticed two tables of presents. At first, I thought that they were all for me, and I was incredibly shocked. But then I found out that even the one birthday party that was originally going to be for me was shared again. I was humiliated. I saved my misery until the end, and then I blew up at my dad and stepmom. They called me ungrateful for what they put together, and how much they spent.

I know that this is petty, but it’s been a pain in the ass for the past 5 years.

I have a cousin who we’ll call Willa (not her real name). She is 7. Every year since she was two or so, Willa always has to blow out my birthday candles and no one is allowed to tell her no because she is the baby of the family. 

Last summer I (F) turned 15 and I tried to gently push Willa away from my cake when I was going to blow out the candles. It is still a few months until my 16th birthday but I want to blow out my own candles. I only have a couple more birthdays before I’m an adult and I want to enjoy them. I’ve always hated birthdays, and the little brat blowing out my candles makes it worse.

I said to my mom that I didn’t want to have my birthday at my aunt and uncles house like I usually do because of Willa. My mom said that I’m being ridiculous because she’s a perfect little angel baby who should do whatever she wants. Yesterday was my aunt’s (Willa’s mom) birthday and Willa blew out her candles. Willa also does it every year when it’s her sister’s birthday.

AITA for wanting to blow out my own candles?

t6x0dm,hzej2pv,t3_t6x0dm,"NTA for how you're feeling, I understand it. However, I will say, perhaps let him visit and take her out on Daddy Daughter days.

She's four, so she's just starting to actually be able to form memories. She can still form a bond with her father. As much as you may dislike what he did, I say give him a chance to form a relationship, and if he doesn't treat her right or if he's just flat out not a good parent, then don't let him see her anymore.

But if he turns out to be a pretty decent father for the rest of her life? That is something important. A child doesn't need both parents in their lives, but it does help. It's more love for that child.

Your feelings are valid, I don't think you're an asshole, but let him have some trial time. Maybe, like, a month or two where he can visit, take her out, maybe have her stay over at his place for a night or two, and kf he doesn't take care of her right or love her right during this trial period, cut him out. You have every right to. Just allow there to be an opportunity for this child to have her father in her life.

Because what if, when she's older, she tries to find him, and finds out that he tried to get back into her life, to right his wrongs, but you didn't let him, now she's going to resent you. If you do the trial period and he doesn't live up to your expectations, and that same scenario happens, you can at least counter back with, ""I tried to let him back into your life but he wasn't a good father, he mistreated you, ignored you, I couldn't trust him with you because I was worried you were going to get hurt"", so now she knows you tried to make it work but HE failed.

Just think about it. Remember that you need to put your personal feelings aside and make your decision off of what is best for your daughter. If you think about it and decide that not letting him back in is what's best for your daughter, then stick with your decision. Just make sure you really think about it and know for sure that this is 100% in HER best interest, and not because of hard feelings you harbor.",-5,0,0,False,True,False,1646448235.0

My ex left me when I was pregnant and told me he had no interest in having a child or being a dad to our daughter. She’s just turned 4 and he has made no effort to see her or be in her life, until last month.

Last month, my brother gave him my address because he’s finally had enough of living it up and wants to settle down and be a family man now. When he came to my home I refused to let him in or let him see my daughter. He told me he was her dad and deserved to see her, which really pissed me off. I told him he wasn’t a dad and if he was her dad he would’ve been there for the night feeds and the dirty diapers, he would’ve heard her first words and seen her first steps, he would’ve been there to comfort her when she had nightmares or congratulate her when she learned something new. He told me I didn’t need to make him feel guiltier and that he had been young and made a mistake back then but he wanted to make up for it now. 

He tried to give me a cheque but I ripped it up in front of him and told him not to come back.

After I ripped the cheque, he told me I was being stubborn and making this difficult for no reason. I told him to leave or I would call the police.

We’ve been fighting both through lawyers and whenever he gets especially angry and decides to call me since.

My older brother was a literal psycho growing up. He would light things on fire, cut people's hair while they slept, my mom and guests included, he'd put dirt in things and try to get people to eat them, put nails and sharp object in places and wait for people to ""find them"" . My mom was a single mother in her early twenties and had no idea how to care for him. So when he turned 11 and he had made a very disturbing attempt to burn down the shed she put him up for adoption and had him sent to a temporary home. At the time I was 4 and she said it was the hardest decision of her life but she knew I wasn't safe as long as he was around and she didn't want to live her life in fear of him. 

 He did get the help he needed and a two parent home that was able to put all their attention on him. He turned out to be a different person from his childhood and we reconnected over social media. We talk and he speaks to our mom on occasion but they still have a rocky relationship because my brother believes she gave up on him. 
We were discussing my pregnancy and he told me to be a better mom than ours and I told him I thought our mom did what was best. He was a difficult kid and she didn't have time or resources to help him and he turned out better. His foster experience only lasted a year and he wasn't put in any bad situations (he said he had a pretty smooth foster experience). I told him that if my kid turns out to be like him I'd be inclined to do the same if I couldn't help them. He called me an asshole saying that I'm just like our mom, a quitter and a child abandoner. He's been contacting my boyfriends family telling them what I said and they're mostly on my side. My boyfriends grandparents think you should never give up on a kid and are telling me I should apologize to him and never say something like this again. He hasn't spoken to me and I'm feeling really bad about how things were left off.

I (29F) work in an office of 6. My coworker Bessie (mid 40s F) frequently uses an affected babyish way of talking, lisp and all, and laughing/maniacally giggling. This is annoying in itself, my other coworkers (all 40s-50s F) don’t like it but don’t say anything to her. 

The issue for me is that it is very high pitched. 

I ruptured both my eardrums when I was a kid (cause unknown) and I’ve had a couple concussions (soccer goalkeeper through college), so I don’t know which is to blame but I am very sensitive to both very high pitched noises and very low bass. It’s a little odd to explain, but it’s like my inner ear area pulses/reverberates briefly which is extremely uncomfortable at best and then a lingering pain that goes away after a few moments.

Bessie’s baby voice and laugh have the effect of clapping great great grandmother’s best china plates together like a capuchin monkey. I cannot listen to music or otherwise shield myself at work since I spend most of my work day on the phone with insurance companies. I often have to ask the person on the other line to repeat themselves because whenever Bessie cackles I can’t hear anything for a few seconds. She does have a normal voice, she also has to talk on the phone as part of her job but otherwise it is incessant. Commenting on literally anything that happens (“kawen is going to da bafroooom!”), or talking loudly to herself in the hopes of someone indulging her. 

Today I was putting papers away in a filing cabinet in the back of the office near the bathrooms, about 50 feet away from where our cubicles are (very long and narrow building). I was bent over the lowest drawer when she snuck up on me and barely a foot away from my ear trilled “peekaboo!!!!!” and laughed. My ears immediately hurt, plus she startled me so I jerked my head up and smacked the back of my head on the handle of the drawer above me, which made her laugh even more. 

Once I stood up, I had my hands over my ears and I told her to quit acting like a squeaky toy, what the hell did she think she was doing sneaking up on me, and to leave me alone. She looked shocked but I didn’t see much as I turned and walked into to a bathroom. 

I was later told I didn’t exactly yell but I did raise my voice enough to be heard at the front, I thought I was speaking at a normal volume but then again I couldn’t hear anything. She left for the day after complaining to our manager that I both verbally harassed and attacked her. 

A few of my other coworkers said I was really mean to Bessie and that I should apologize, when I asked them if they really wanted her to continue talking like she did they didn’t have an answer. 

AITA for what I said and/or WIBTA if I didn’t apologize fully?

I 24f and my husband 27m have a Sunday day wedding next month. The bride and my Inlaw family want us to bring our daughter with us to the wedding. ( she is not in the wedding just want us to I get her as a guest also the bride has not asked us directly just her family and my Inlaw’s. ) My husband and I do not want to because we would like to enjoy ourselves for the day and not have to worry about how loud she is or making sure she is on her best behavior. ( Worried about food throwing, nap times, running around etc. ) We both believe weddings are not places for young children and really just want to enjoy the day and celebrate with family. We have already secured a babysitter. Our Inlaw’s are giving us a hard time about not having her there. They really don’t have a reason since we all live close and see her often, they just believe she should be there to celebrate even though they would not be assisting with taking care of her. So are we wrong for not wanting to bring her?

It depends on the laws in your country/state.  In some jurisdictions, only assets and liabilities up to the point of separation are considered in divorce (obviously income when considering maintenance levels is different).   

From a moral/ethical point of view, your finances are separate now - ask him if he is also going to take on 50% of the credit card bills you have run up since you separated as his debt too?  Pretty sure he will say nope to that one (and it makes the point quite succinctly).  If his mother calls again, I would also ask her if half of her money and assets are going to be yours then…?

However, apart from the legal, I guess you should also consider how much of his inheritance and how he shared it with you - did he give you half and say go spend it on yourself or save it…as your money? Or did it go into the family pot for holidays and big purchases? 

When I got divorced, I could have legally taken half of my ex’s pension pot but it didn’t feel right so I didn’t even though I had a much smaller pension pot at the time.

t6oikb,hzd0ock,t3_t6oikb,"There are two aspects to this, the strictly legal and then a larger, more ethical sense that may ultimately have bigger long term consequences.

From a strict legal perspective, you need to talk to a lawyer and you need to do it soon.  Don't trust any armchair lawyers on the internet who don't intimately know the laws where you live.  Figure out exactly what your rights and obligations are on your own.

The other side of this is from the  ethical perspective.  And this may not sound as important to you now, but I guarantee you this will (eventually) influence the relationship you have with your kids.  Because what you decide to do will (eventually) get out and your kids will (eventually) learn about it.  There are people that are claiming that courts would prevent child alienation, and to an extent that is true.  There is certainly no reason children under 10 should be told this information.  But it's also true there isn't any reason why this information shouldn't be told to them when they are 18.  And it could be a bad look for you for your kids to learn that your father shared his inheritance with you but you didn't share your inheritance with him.  And I say this from experience.  My parents got separated when I was 5 and am now in my 30s; and I can tell you I learned a great deal about my parents' marriage after I became an adult, well over a decade after the divorce was finalized.

I think in order to act ethically you and your ex need to come to some sort of agreement to compensation for him using his inheritance to help the family.  Note: this may not be paying him back half of the inheritance, depending on how the money was used.  Depending on the size of the inheritance, it may be worthwhile to involve lawyers in this.

That said, if you are fully divorced (i.e. not just separated), then I would also say you shouldn't give him anything of your inheritance.

His behavior has cost him all his money, his job, and his housing.

His behavior has cost you money, your housing, your security. Now you’re living with your parents, and he doesn’t see “saving money.” He sees “more money for marijuana.”

Many people here are telling you to get rid of him, but I completely understand it’s not that easy. He’s probably bright, funny, charming 90% of the time. You know he can work hard. He’s doing it right now to find a job.

But it’s that 10% that’s the problem, and you’re probably not ready to walk away from the good 90% because of the bad 10%.

He will not change for you. If he changes because you tell him he has to, he will resent you for “being controlling” and you will resent him for making you into his mother.

Me (27 F) and my fiancé (28 M) have been going through some financial and marital struggles. I’ve been at my job for 2 years and my income is a pretty good amount. 

Fiancé, let’s call him Tyler, works a minimum wage fast food job. I’ve never brought up the income difference to him mainly because it doesn’t really matter who the bread winner is and he loves his job. Recently over the course of 4 months, he has been spending well above his means including some of my paychecks and even savings. 

I have two car payments, insurances, bills etc. which he does help with bills but not the cars because I believe they are my vehicles my responsibility. We live in a state where Marijuana is legal and that’s where most of the money is going. I’ve tried keeping us afloat to no avail. I’ve begged him to cut down on how much he buys and he always says he will but never does. We’ve had multiple arguments regarding this. So far we’ve had to move due to not being able to afford the mortgage due to said spending habits. 

We decided mutually it would be beneficial to move back in with our parents as to save money. I finally put my foot down when we lost our home and told him I was separating finances and access and that I would no longer be helping support his habit. He also recently lost his job due to his habit and not wanting to go to work so he is no longer contributing. 

He’s been begging me for money for his habit and I told him no. He called me a selfish asshole, went on about how I always brag about my pay (which I’ve never done due to wanting to stay humble. I didn’t come from much and am trying to build a better life than what I had),and that he needed money for food, gas, etc. Now I have no problem helping him with necessary things as such but I know that whatever money I give him will go to his habit. Am I the asshole?

So your parents decided without a warning to cut your brother of financially to get a new child when he was just 21. 21 is an age where you get your degree. In my country your parents have to finance your education (bachelor, masters) until you are 25 if they have enough income.

Furthermore they went out of their way for this child while they didn't do that when you were growing up nor when you were grown up. 

So hes completly right with his resentment. And financial aspect dont make sense here in my opinion, because you decide how much you work/consume/save.

This is gross. Chase is family, and your brother is being incredibly immature here. 

> Caleb says he’s allowed to feel uncomfortable so he doesn’t want them there with Chase.

Oh, you can’t stop him from having feelings. But some feelings do come from a place of possessiveness, insecurity, or jealousy and shouldn’t be given the samw respect.

The reason why folks should in general respect someone’s wishes when they say they are uncomfortable is because it usually is about personal boundaries or feeling unsafe around someone. It sounds like your brother is trying to frame his feelings here as “uncomfortable” as leverage to get you on his side and exclude a child from family activities.

The only time it would be fair to exclude a child from activities is if that child is a danger to someone else. (And uh, some kids…something is wrong with them, and they will maliciously hurt others. My deepest sympathies for any parent dealing with that.)

It may be possible he doesn’t really understand that what he’s feeling is jealousy - our society is pretty bad about teaching men that kind of emotional introspection and identification.

But it is jealousy. And it’s an ugly look, a 26yo man jealous of a six year old getting more time and attention than he did. 

Which you pointed out in this case is a matter of your parents being in a different financial position now. Also…they are more experienced parents having raised other children to adulthood. 

And you know, it’s one thing to be hurt - god knows feelings aren’t always rational to begin with.

My parents love kids, and after my youngest brother Caleb (26m) moved out they decided to look into adoption. My family and I (27m) supported that decision:They adopted our brother Chase 2 years later who was 3 at the time, now he’s 6. Our family’s welcomed him all except for Caleb. He’s been used to being the “baby” of the family, around that time my dad told him he’s going to have stop relying on them financially and grow up. That was just my dad being my dad wanting him to stop being dependent but then when they announced they’re looking into adoption my brother took it as they set him aside for another kid. He also doesn’t like how both our parents are staying at home to be with Chase and taking time off work, when they never did that when we were growing up. Our parents were still involved in our lives but obviously they are in different places in their lives financially.

I’m really close to Chase, he loves spending time with my son (his nephew) because they’re only a few months apart. Caleb not so much. He’s refused to come to my parents house at all in the last few years since. 

Yesterday me some of us, my brother, sister and cousins had lunch together. Someone got the idea we should go camping next weekend since we have done that in a while as a family. Bring our kids along too since we all have our own families. I suggested calling my dad up so they could join us too. Only one who wasn’t on board with that was obviously Caleb. It’s “family only” and it would be really weird. My sister’s kids, all my cousins spouses and kids were going from ages 4-11 so it wasn’t even an issue about kids going. Just that Chase would be there too. 

And I told him “you know what you need to get the fuck over yourself already and stop whining about a little kid being in our family.” That ticked him off. Caleb says he’s allowed to feel uncomfortable so he doesn’t want them there with Chase. It really soured the whole meetup. They’re not a fan of Caleb’s reaction or so they say but they do think I was an ass being so dismissive of his feelings. 

Even if he’s not right those are his feelings even though they do think we should invite my parents and Chase to go with us because we know they love the outdoors. My brother is still saying he won’t talk to me until I apologize all because of my attitude with him about the whole thing. Maybe it did come off that way because I personally don’t see what the big deal is about Chase, we’re not blood related but I still consider him my baby brothe. AITA?

I left my home state for college. Both my mom and grandma was against the choice and basically cut me off. It has been difficult during the whole 2020 madness because when my school went to online class for a semester my mom and grandma basically told me if I came home they wouldn’t support me so I moved off campus found a cheap ass apartment and got a part time job to support myself. 

They continued to harass me until I went low contact. Most of it was political like don’t get the jab. I did and that caused another six months of both of them being control freaks. 
Since Christmas 2019 I have not bothered to visit or see them. At first it was tough and now I don’t want to bother. I found an internship when I graduate and I will be leaving directly from college to move across the country. 

My mom and grandma have already planned this huge graduation and coming home party for me. I’m not coming home and rather spend my time with people who have actually support me. I told them that and they said they already rented the place and family members are coming from out of town. 

They tried to say I will make so much money from the gifts. I said no again and I’m not coming and they can’t force or manipulate to come to this party. 
My grandma started crying that she was so proud of me. I pointed out she and my mom added to stress while I was away at college and healthy families don’t do that. She should have supported me through my struggles and not added to them. I told her she doesn’t get to celebrate my success that’s my own and I will do it with my friends that supported me. I told my mom and grandma while I’m finishing up this degree I want no more contact from them. I have a few months left and they should have supported my journey.

Now all of my family is angry and I have gone around and deleted them and then deleted any old social media profiles. I’m not going to that party. The last I heard was grandma was so sick because I hurt her heart from how I acted towards my family. That family member got blocked also.

Instantly say “I told you no pranks!” He then tries to make some half ass excuse at which point you smash the pie into his lazy face. Then you both turn and smile at sister and have a good laugh. Then he pulls her aside after it’s all cleaned up and says “sorry for being a lazy prankster while we were growing up”

A complete asshole.

YTA.

You're wrong.

>She said sorry but she wasn't going to take a risk snd invite him so he'd ruin her wedding, and besides that her fiance does not feel comfortable having him there and she agreed with him.

Is she wrong?  Can you say with 100% certainty that your husband, the ""jokester"", wouldn't play another prank on her at her wedding?  ""Oh, he wouldn't do that at such an important event!"" you say.  But he did it at her engagement party, so clearly you're wrong about that, too.

>I was stunned I called her cruel because this is her brother, and he never had malicious intentions towards her yet, she keeps getting offended and oversensitive over everything he does, at the end of the day they're family.

My friend (18F) has decided to make me(19F) her godmother and babysitter for her baby once her baby is born. She also wanted me to organize her baby shower. Which i obviously said no for many reasons (thankfully she accepted no as an answer.) I have communicated with her that I don’t want to be a babysitter since I have been busy with school and work and don’t have much free time for myself. Friend has argued with me that she wants free time as well once she has the baby and I should babysit for her since I don’t have to permanently take care of a baby.  I asked my friend, why have a baby if you aren’t prepared to take care of it? (the baby wasn’t an accident and she was trying for it)  She was upset with my question and told me she didn’t have anyone else who supports her and her pregnancy. I told her I am not going to be responsible for her baby  since I have my own life and my own problems to worry about. Friend told me how I am a horrible friend and if the roles were reverse she would be thrilled to babysit and I should understand friends help out other friends. Am I the asshole for not being a good friend and taking care my friends baby?

Op, you're NTA. I wouldn't want to send my daughter (close to your daughters age) to someone who had done this to her, especially since him passing is then going to make her feel abandoned all over again. 

I would sit down with your daughter and tell her what's going on, tell her what he said has requested, and then listen to her thoughts and feelings.

Throw away. 

I (f37) need some unbiased opinions. My ex (m40 Mark*), never married, and his wife (Dana* f35 been together 10yrs) built a house about 6years ago. It is a 4bdrm, 2 living spaces, 2 bathrooms. The intention was for each of my kids (females 15, 14 and 12) to have their own rooms.  I have never liked Dana, she is strict about everything, breakfast  is at 7.30am and dinner at 7pm. She says this is because she has to drop the kids off at her parent's before she goes to work. I was told Dana couldn't get pregnant and I was ok with that, happy even. That meant my kids would be the sole focus for their Dad, but she wanted kids so I heard they tried IVF. 

Dana had twins, girl and boy, they are now 7years old. Dana and Mark decided that because they only have my kids two nights a month and for 1 week every school holidays, 2 weeks over Christmas ( I moved 4 hours away after Mark and I seperated) that the girl's could all share a single room. Before this the twins would sleep in Dana and Marks living space on a fold out lounge.

When I heard about this after my kids came back from holidays I was so angry. Dana explained that the room is a double bedroom and fits 3 single beds and a set of drawers for each girl, they have also placed room dividers between the beds for 'privacy'. She claimed that since the other two rooms are a bit smaller and the twins live there full time and have more items it made more sense. 

When I spoke to Mark he said that they are about to start building an 'add' on room attached to the second living space that will have another two bedrooms, but they will be a little smaller insize then the twins room. Mark got really angry when I told him the twins should be the ones staying in the added on rooms. My kids are getting treated like less than compared to Dana's kids.

I told my kids that until Mark and Dana agree to my suggestion I don't want to send them to their Dads. My kids are really angry, my eldest called me an asshole, and that they want to see their halfsiblings and 'family'. I am doing this for them but AITA in this situation?

My partner and I are currently arguing because he just told me yesterday afternoon that he invited a bunch of friends over for dinner tonight. We had parties, either at our house or at a friend's house every weekend in February, and we had out of town guests staying with us on two of those weekends. I was really looking forward to a quiet weekend and catching up on some work (grading papers) that I need to do. Now I have to shop for food, clean the house, cook, entertain, and clean up afterwards. Basically, the whole weekend is now gone. When I ask him to help, before or after the party, he always says he's working overtime for extra money ""for us.""

For context, prior to the pandemic, we used to go out with friends on the weekends a lot. This didn't require so much preparation, cleaning and cooking. We could go out for a few hours and still have the rest of the weekend free. Now, since we don't really go to bars or restaurants anymore, my partner and our friends want to take turns having parties at each other's houses. I would be fine with this once or twice a month, but it has turned into every single weekend. I've tried to decline or let my partner go without me, but he won't because he drinks more than I do at these parties, so he wants me to drive. If I don't go, then I'm ruining his social outlet.

The other issue is that since New Year's I've been trying to lose weight. I'm eating healthier, exercising, and logging everything I eat in an app to stay on track. I've stuck with it and been modestly successful so far, but I know I could have lost at least twice as much by now if we weren't having parties every weekend. I've lost and gained back the same 2 lbs. at least 6 times since New Year's, and it's very frustrating. I do all this hard work throughout the week, and it's ruined every weekend. For example, one of my friends who's coming over tonight just texted me and said she'll bring French fries and a dessert for everyone. So, even though I'll make salmon, a veggie tray and a salad, there will be all sorts of other unhealthy foods as well. I can't expect everyone else to eat only what I'm eating.

I told my partner this, and he says, ""Just control yourself and don't eat or drink at the parties."" Well, some of our friends are ""food pushers"" (it's cultural). I can politely decline some delicious dish or dessert 50 times, but that 51st time they try to get me to eat it, I may give in.

If I start refusing to participate in all of these parties, AITA? I may be because I would be taking away my partner's social outlet, and our friends just want to spend time together.

Binge eating IS an eating disorder. If you're regularly eating more than you want or need, and put more food on your plate than you know you want, if you're stress eating, you're also eating in an disordered way.
Your sister 100% went about pointing it out the wrong way, but you were needlessly cruel in your retaliation.

My (15f) sister (Eve, 18f) used to deal with a severe ED which left her extremely underweight. She's not fully recovered yet, however she has become healthier since going to therapy. Keep in mind through out the whole thing I was nothing less than supportive and I tried my best to help her in any way i could. I've personally never struggled with any major insecurities, however my body has been undergoing a lot of changes due to stress from school and other areas of my life, and because of this i've began binge eating, which has in turn affected my weight. My parents have been trying to save for some therapy, however they've not brought the topic up again and I dont want to bother them asking.

So the incident happened yesterday. I was making myself some food (as usual, adding much more than what i should eat) and my sister came in to make her food. The whole time i could see her looking at me with some sort of disgusted look, and after awhile it got really annoying and I asked if she wanted something. She told me she doesnt think I should be eating that much food because its already showing and if i dont stop soon i'm gonna regret it. I was shocked because it has always been a rule not to comment on each others bodies, and i guess i snapped because i said i'm not going to be taking advice from someone who hasnt even sorted through their ED yet and is still underweight. She started crying and my parents came in and i explained what happened. My mum began yelling at me that i was insensitive and Eve was just trying to help in her own way, however my dad said that Eve shouldnt have been commenting on my body anyway and he could see why i would react like that. There's been a little tension since because Eve has refused to come out of her room and my mum is blaming me for possibly making Eve relapse completely. I find it totally unfair though because I feel like she's putting Eve's mental health before mine. AITA?

My boyfriend (28M) and I (26F) have been together for about 1 1/2 years. This is my first relationship. We love each other very much, but there are times when he gets upset with me because I didn't do what he was expecting. For example, one day we planned to meet and he was delayed by something which was fine, so I told him to take his time. Later, he was upset and told me that he expected me to ask him if he wanted me to cook lunch for him (we agreed to eat at our own homes beforehand). And said that I don't care about him which is not true. 

Another instance was when we went to a store because I needed peanut butter. He seemed upset after we left, so I asked him why. He stated that I should have asked him if he wanted to buy it as well. I explained that I knew he didn't like it, so I didn't ask, but he said I should have asked anyway. Finally, we went to a popular restaurant last night. He said the noise was making him irritated, which I didn't think was a huge issue. After the meal he told me that he expected me to ask him if he wanted to go somewhere else. At that time I didn't know he actually has a problem with loud noises. Needless to say, he was upset about it. 

I'm well aware that I need to do better but I feel like he expects me to read his mind and it just makes me feel bad that I can't meet his expectations.

Your MIL should not be so impatient and swearing around children, whether they are old enough to hear it is not the point.

I did not get the politics part, but learned about the laws about clothing and hair, and how strict it was, and why people from other countries tried so hard to get here.

Especially about how hard it is on women, not just about conduct, but marital laws in a general sense, and how women are treated so badly by the legal system. It really cemented in why so many people are desperate to come here and live.

MIL grew up in the Middle East. She grew up around a lot of hurtful and oppressive ideas and while she does not believe in them, she gets super annoyed when westerns act at all surprised or taken aback. MIL and I have a decent relationship, but she is not a good grandmother as she really doesn't like kids. She has been showing slightly more interest in my kids since they got around middle school age. 

There is some complicated backstory but I'm going to try to sum it up. MIL is married to her stepbrother. She was always in love with him, but they used to bicker a lot as teens. She did want to marry him, but MIL played some prank on some girl she didn't like by locking her and the stepbrother in a closet, so people would gossip about the girls virginity. Stepbrother did the honorable thing and married the girl so her life wouldn't be ruined. MIL was devastated and was a nasty person for the first decade of her own son's life because she was so hung up over this guy.

He eventually divorced his wife and married MIL. MIL tried explaining this to my kids (13 and 15) and they just did not get it. Growing up in the US with liberal parents, they could not process this situation and why the stepbrother married someone he didn't love, why virginity was so important, why MIL went on to also marry someone she didn't love instead of becoming intendent, etc. MIL was getting annoyed and rolling her eyes. She tried explaining the other woman's life really could have been ruined and my kids were acting like MIL and this other woman should have just fought the system.

MIL got more and more condescending and then finally went to take something out of the oven and muttered what the fuck. I asked if she had a problem and she said I should just let her get annoyed. I sent the kids out of the room and said I didn't like her tone or her attitude.

MIL said she was concerned that my kids were a little dumb and she isn't saying the ideas in that country were right, but they need to educate themselves and maybe should ""read a book or something"" because she is concerned that they can't process.

I snapped at her that she is a shit grandmother and my kids are totally normal teens and maybe if she life wasn't such a shit show with banging her stepbrother and being a bully, they would get it. I said she shouldn't be calling anyone stupid when she knows nothing about kids and hardly raised her own. Needless to say she wasn't happy with me. MIL feels I was the asshole for escalating when she was just frustrated by my kids inability to process.

Background: my husband and I split after his current g/f found him cheating with another g/f and a friend suggested she call his “ex” wife…(me) needless to say the marriage ended. Since then my ex has had very little to do with our kids, hasn’t seen them in 3 years and sometimes calls them on their birthday. He had another child with his current partner but hasn’t even told our kids about it. 

Last week I received a text from my ExMIL who I have had little to minimal contact with in around 4 yrs stating that their grandfather is Ill and won’t be around much longer and could they have a photo of the kids.

I’m have not yet responded because of the following:
My ex almost bankrupt me and my parents (guarantors on the family home) because he decided to live in it but not pay the mortgage or council rates

My parents were always the ones to help us out if we got in a bind whilst his parents just sat back and did nothing

My ex walked out and has shown no interest in the kids (forgot his daughters bday)and never rings them (I’m talking will ring max 3 times a year bdays if he remembers and Xmas)

 My ex in-laws were of no assistance when the bank was looking to reposes our home and take my parents home to cover the cost. 

I have sorted that all out as my ex husband just kept changing phone numbers and wouldn’t provide any address (again ex in-laws didn’t help) so it all fell to me to make sure my parents didn’t suffer any consequences and is now all sorted. 


I now feel like this request is just a way of self gratification of “look at our family/ grandchildren” when they have no idea of what family really means. 

So AITA for ignoring a request of photos???

My in-laws invited me and my children on vacation. I said yes because they’re still family to me. As far as I was aware, my husband wasn’t supposed to be there. 

He ended up joining us on the third day and clearly had no idea me or the kids would be there either. I asked him what he was doing there when it was just the two of us, and he told me he should be asking me that question since it was his family’s vacation. 

The vacation made our already tense relationship even worse and in the end he told me he didn’t want me to go on vacation with his family anymore and he thought I should put more distance between myself and them. I told him he couldn’t tell me what to do anymore and now he keeps pretending to want to see the kids so that he can argue with me over it.

My wife and I moved into an apartment complex mid2020, each apartment has their allotted parking spaces (1-2 spaces)& they can’t be negotiated. Our apartment only has 1 space. 

We noticed that in one of the spaces, (easiest to drive in/out of, closest to garage door&elevator, right next to the curb & is covered while nearly all the rest of the parking is open air) had 2-3 cars alternate parking there, so my wife asked about it & the girl Amy, in apartment #39 (owner of said space) was an international student who freed up the space when she went to work during term break. She didn’t care who used the space as long as she got it back during her schooling. 

Due to the big C, she hadn’t been able to return for a while, & in that time my wife had a baby. The autumn/winter was really wet so the neighbours kindly offered space #39 so my wife could park there with our newborn. Eventually it just became my wife’s parking space. 

So the issue is Amy came back while we were on a long weekend & we took my wife’s car, so obviously when we came back there was a car parked, but at the time we didn’t know it was Amy. I told my wife to just park outside the gated parking lot, that the car will most likely be gone by morning. But it wasnt & my wife said she never saw the spot empty for the first 3 weeks. 

Once my wife got to park in Amy’s spot & refused to drive her car for 4 days because she’d “lose the spot!”  

About a week after \*that\*, I met Amy getting out her car. Remembering what the neighbours had said, I apologised for using her space and said I’d pass the message onto my wife. Amy asked if that where the notes had been coming from and seeing my confused face and said “I’ll show you”. 

my wife had been leaving rude notes on the windshield, wanting to get Amy’s car towed for parking illegally and she was disrupting a young family’s routine, but she gave no name or apartment # so Amy had no idea who wrote them. I only knew of this when Amy handed me a stack of them. I saw my wife’s writing & my face must have made it obvious, coz Amy then said “look I know you have a young kid, but you got free reign when he was a little baby & it’s the only space I have, you’re gonna have to park your second car where the others do.” 

I showed my wife the notes, & she just said that she had been using the space for over a year & it should be deemed hers over a part-time resident, and had a right to fight for it. I didn’t agree as Amy legally owns it, & told her to just use our original space from now on, I’d park outside. My wife got this very sour look & told me I don’t care about my sons well-being & shouldn’t be taking Amy’s side. My wants me to negotiate with Amy, but I think that’s dumb as her space literally has her apartment # painted on it, it’s her space. I told my wife it might suck having to pack in car outside in the rain, but the spaces aren’t trading cards, they’re painted with their corresponding apartment #. Things have been tense since.

I ended up having to have both their cars towed to get them to stop parking in my spot.  I was tired of being texted by my tenants that some asshole was in their spot.  The HOA put the word out to stop parking in spaces that did not belong to them.  My current tenant is moving out in April and it’s going to be empty again for a while.

It’s not really your place to ask why she was fired, the school district _did_ hire her and deem her fit enough.

But something is clearly amiss with her leadership, educators shouldn’t be leaving a school in droves after a single hire. It’s a clear point of causation.

Your concerns should have been voiced directly to the school district, with evidence from teachers who have resigned and other parents who have noticed a change. Nepotism, favoritism, and pay to play is rampant in a lot of school districts; there may be a political reason she was placed there after being fired from the old district. Or, there could not have been. She could have been fired for speaking her mind about an issue and that’s why she remains distance. The point is, you don’t know and it wasn’t fair for you to voice those concerns directly to her face.

And, it’s Aerosmith. (Edit-misread that line)

final comments - While there is clearly something wrong with the integration of this new principal, your comments here made it very clear that you came to this sub just to get validation and toot your own horn (if you're not a troll).

Your attitude about being a ""stakeholder"" because you pay the same taxes literally every single other person in your town pays is heavy with the stench of narcissism.

My two sons go to elementary school. The old principal (Mr. G) was great. He has respected and liked. The kids were crazy about him. He took a promotion and left last year.

They brought in a new principal (Ms. K) and I personally got this unlikable vibe from her. She just wasn't personal with the parents or kids. The kids seemed indifferent or scared of her. I tried to talk to her and she blew me off. Things don't run as efficiently or effectively as before. Whatever. My kids are 3rd and 5th graders so they're not going to be there long.

Over the course of the year, I saw a lot of the old staff disappear and a new person like every other month. 

My eldest son has Asperger's and ADHD so he has an aide (Mr. F) who had been with him since kindergarten. He told me that he was going to be leaving next week. I assumed he must of found another job. He said he couldn't stand working with the new principal and that's explains the turnover and a lot of the teachers are jumping ship. It made sense. I was pretty pissed about his leaving though. 

I asked to speak to Ms K for 15-20 minutes today. Before meeting with her, I looked her up abd she had gotten fired from another school district. You really have to mess up to be fired. I told her that as a dad, as a member of the community, as someone who cares about the school, I was concerned about her leadership. Good people leaving left and right. I told her she does not seem like she's fitting in.

She told me she was doing the best job she could do. Then I asked her why was she fired for on her last job after less than a year? 

She was taken aback and told me that our district thought she was qualified. I countered that so did the one that fired her. I told her I wasn't trying to be a dick. As a stakeholder, I'm alarmed at what I'm seeing. As a principal, she should be able to deal with that. 

Oh and she made this poster of her favorite things (as a way to promote herself) and her favorite band was ""Arrowsmith."" I did ask her who that was and she said the band with Steven Tyler.

You do have a stake in the school your kid goes to.  And at the end of the day, it’s not just staff, it’s the kids who get screwed over by bad teachers & administration.  If everyone is quitting, that means something is up.  You’re sending your kids to a place for 7 hours a day where bad things are brewing.  You’ve got a right to confront someone who is responsible & find out what’s going on.  And under the circumstances, you’re not obligated to be gentle.  Polite, respectful, but not gentle.  

It’s going to be an uncomfortable conversation but it kinda has to happen.  Honestly it should be common.  Too many bad teachers & principals aren’t held accountable for what they break & it means the good teachers, in addition to probably being underpaid, have to deal with the fallout.  

In a way, it’s better you take it up with her first rather than the school board.  You’re letting her know others see what’s going on & giving her a chance to maybe think about how she’s operating & try to make changes before she ends up getting herself fired again.  Maybe she shapes up, maybe there’s more to the story.  It’s always worth it to suss it out, even when it’s going to suck.  

A lot of the comments saying YTA I think are also from people who are likely afraid of confrontation in general.  Approaching someone you don’t know about something as personal as a previous job that went badly must seem completely unthinkable under any circumstances.  I don’t think they really process the nature of putting your kid in someone else’s hands though.  

You should be asking tough questions of the people you trust your kids with.  If she can’t handle confrontation, that’s reason alone for her to go for a different career.",-2,0,0,False,False,False,1646464261.0

A stakeholder is anyone who has a vested interest in the success of a system or organization, or is impacted but that system. This is often owners, investors and workers, but it's customers too. The basic idea is that a customer might make decisions about their purchases based on the stability of a company. For example, would you buy a brand new computer at fill price, knowing the manufacturer is going under, and the warranty would be useless? Employees are stakeholders too, even if they don't own any part of it. Would you take a job somewhere knowing it was closing next month? 

And these days, it's not just about finances and continuing operations. As a society we are putting more emphasis on the triple bottom line. Social impact, environmental impact and financial performance are the goals. People make choices about what to buy based on how it fits their morals and ideals.

Ok so hear me out. I (23f) am getting married the 3rd week of May, and I had asked my sister (25 f) in October if she’d be a bridesmaid. She was so excited, and has been there for me the entire way. However, my sisters been in some financial trouble, and is thousands of dollars in debt. She called me up last week and said her finances weren’t in a place for her to attend, and to find someone else to take her place. So I did! And the girl was so excited and cried. Two days later she said she has 3 grand coming in and she will be a bridesmaid. That’s not the issue. The problem is that there’s 11 weeks till the wedding, and she hasn’t bought ANY thing for the event. Dresses, shoes, etc. The place the girls are getting the dresses takes 5 weeks for the dresses ti arrive, however because of high demand, they are taking 8 weeks to arrive. She won’t have funds for another 3 weeks, which means if the dress takes 8 weeks to arrive, her dress won’t arrive till the week of the wedding. She lives in Michigan, and the wedding is in Cali. I’m top of her indecisiveness, if she attends, I need to add another groomsman, however I can’t do that until I know she’s coming. Which I still don’t know if she will make it on time as a bridesmaid. So am I the asshole for wanting to tell her she can be a guest, but I cant have her as a bridesmaid?

A wedding is a ceremony of commitment and fidelity why would you want your sisters unfaithful ex to attend your wedding.

Chances are they want to rub the relationship in your sisters face why else would the ex want to be at an event where your sister and your family who I guess he has met are attending if not for the attention it would bring.

I'd also worry that they want to do something even more crass like proposing at your wedding.

The fact your friend was reluctant to say who she was dating in the beginning of them officially dating is a sign she felt shame that she was sleeping your sisters ex before your friend officially started dating him and the fake sympathy she said to your sister at being there for her when your sister split from the ex is a sign she wanted to make sure if your sister knew she was one of the girls your sisters ex was sleeping with.

You're not an asshole for not wanting someone you don't want to see, who has hurt someone you care about in the past, at your wedding. That's absolutely reasonable, no doubt about it. Plus, the potential for an altercation or something that could ruin the event to happen would totally be amplified by his presence, and it would be a shame to make everyone uneasy with him there, when the day is supposed to be about your wedding. 

That being said, if I were you, I would definitely expect this to drive a rift between you and your friend. It's pretty difficult to tell a friend of yours that their S/O can't come to an event because it's problematic, but the truth is that there's no good course of action here. Either you upset your friend (who probably also will not come, and you could potentially permanently drive a rift), or you upset your *sister,* and I think it really comes down to who you value more being part of your life, and you a part of their's, into the future. 

tl;dr - you're definitely not an asshole for this, but it's probably going to cost you your friendship, unfortunately - there's just not a good way to address this situation.",-5,0,0,False,True,False,1646429201.0

I shall try and keep this short, though I have a tendency to ramble and add more than necessary info so I apologize ahead of time. Also, I'm on mobile. Anyway, I'm supposed to be getting married early October 2022. It's not gonna be a big wedding or anything, but me and my fiance both have friends that we dont want to leave out. 

I have this friend (Amanda). We have known each other since highschool, and we arent incredibly close by any means but we are still somewhat good friends and hang out regularly and I would like her to be there. The problem is, I just recently found out who she is now dating and she wants to bring him as her plus one.

My sister (Lily) and her ex (Steve) broke up about 10 months ago, because she found out he was cheating. She was heartbroken, and I know along with that pain she still has a lot of resentment for him and doesnt even like hearing his name. He was a shit boyfriend so my family has no problem with him no longer being in our lives.  

8 months ago, Amanda told me she had started talking to someone and she really liked him and everything. She wouldnt tell me who, not even his name, because she said she didnt wanna share anything about him till it got more serious. I didnt really understand the secrecy, but didnt force her to tell me anything and just let her know I was happy for her and hope it all worked out.

Well last week, she told me she was dating Steve. They had gotten more serious and she wanted to make their relationship public to the people they care about. She also said she knew how much I disliked him and what he had done to my sister, and hoped I would try to understand their love and be happy for her and try to see him in a different light. I was a little shocked at first, since I really didnt expect her to be with a guy like him, and she knew what kind of person and boyfriend he was. But it isnt my place, and I told her that I'm happy shes happy, and that was that. Well two days later, we are texting about the wedding and everything and she mentions steve being her plus one. I do not want him there. Not only because I know my sister, who's my moh, doesnt want him there, but also because I dont like him and neither does my fiance. 

I immediately told her that Steve was not invited to the wedding. She was confused, and I explained to her that I was sorry, and I'm happy for her, but I didnt want him there. At first she thought it was just because my sister would be, and kept saying that they wouldnt even be near each other and it would be fine. But then i explained that with everything that happened,  we didnt want him there. I said sorry again, but she kept saying how I dont want her to be happy, how I just want to live in the past, how I want to punish her for finding love, stuff like that. None of that is true, and I tried to tell her that but she stopped responding.

So now I'm left feeling like a complete asshole and i dont know if i should just let steve come or not.

2) not having pre-arranged confirmations re: attendance (who TF allowed the parent to even put the 8yo down on a list for a teenage youth group???) should be checked and arranged in advance

3) How TF was the parent allowed to even drop off the 8yo for the excursion??? The organizers, WAAY before departure should have said absolutely no way were they accepting the kid.

4) why were the parents allowed to abandon the kid without emergency contact details/emergency contingency plan if ANYONE (teenagers etc) had an emergency??? (By the way. Dumping an 8yo to a teenage youth group IS an immediate emergency!!)

5) Who were the responsible adults?????? (Not just for the kids, but for the teenagers)

6) And this may be controversial: Was a priest the only adult on the trip ( I am not casting aspirations on the priest, but there should be a cadre of responsible adults on the trip- unclear from the OP’s narrative- not the OP’s fault).

AITA for telling my partner he has too much ego for somebody who hasn’t achieved much?

So, I (24F) have been with my partner (26 M) for 3 years. Initially things were fine. Lately his expectations are getting too much but most of the times he nice and sweet. A couple months back he told me to “fuck off” for literally nothing. Like I don’t even remember over what. I remember I wasn’t even fighting. Just teasing. He didn’t like my tone. 
Last night, he was busy with his friends all day so we hadn’t spoken. So, I was at work which was quite stressful as we had one of the patients who was at risk from herself . I came home late. He called me and by that time, I hadn’t even changed my work clothes as I had just reached. He asked me to come meet him and I said to him no. He sounded drunk. I changed topic many times and told him I had a busy shift. Then finally I said to him, I am tired and will talk to you tomorrow. Don’t feel well. This is while he is requesting me to go meet him. I agree I was getting annoyed and I was hungry and hadn’t eaten. I did mention to him about the client  situation. 
He told me to Fuck off. And hung up. I called him and I was like excuse me? He goes you are giving me attitude. Any person that gives me attitude can fuck off and so can you bitch. 
I was taken aback. I was like just because I said no? He said because you said no in attitude. 
I told him that he’s not some king that people who have achieved a lot more than him are more humble and he hasn’t even achieved much for having such an inflated ego. 
This is where I feel like I may be the AH. May be he was too drunk. Even then. Abuse is not okay. But I Atleast should’ve controlled myself and talked when he was sober. 
My family has finally accepted our relationship and we are meant to get married next year. We live separately. Culture thing. If I tell them now of this, I’ll be the black sheep all my life.

This happened two weeks ago but I'm still pretty pissed off and being told I'm overreacting. I think it shows a complete lack of respect for my time. I'm 27F and my BF of 5 years is going to be 28 in 2 days. I had made plans for a week long trip to Pennsylvania probably about a month ago. He was originally not going because he had a fishing trip but decided to a few days later. We live 19 hours away but were driving for the scenery, as there were places we wanted to see along the way.

We were due to leave on Friday, 2 weeks ago, around 11am. We packed up the night before and we were all ready to go. This man had 2 weeks to do last minute shit but instead of doing so, he chose to go see his moms new horse the morning we were supposed to leave. He didnt tell me this was his plan. He said he had to run errands but didnt say what. He left around like 8am that morning and said he would ""be right back"" but as you can imagine, he didnt come right back. His sister called me while he was at his parents (his sister still lives at home) and asks why I didnt come with my BF to say goodbye and I made a snarky comment saying ""probably because I had no idea he was going over there because we were supposed to leave the state by 11"". She just goes quiet (because it's already 2pm at this point) and says that my BF is out helping his father lay bedding down and get the stable ready for the new horse. 

I will admit that this truly pissed me off beyond belief. They had gotten that horse 3 days prior to this. He had plenty of time to help during those days and now he is taking away from MY vacation (the ONLY time I've ever been able to take a vacation). All of my stuff was in the vehicle so I couldnt even just leave and go by myself. Not saying I would have but the thought definitely crossed my mind once or twice. 

He finally got home that night around 8pm. I'm not going to start a trip at 8pm and not be able to see the sites I wanted to see along the way OR drive through the night OR pay extra for a hotel when I already had booked an AirBnB. He just wanted to leave right then but I refused and told him we wouldnt be in this position if he didnt selfishly fuck up my plans. It would have been one thing if the plans hadnt been set in stone but they were and they were thoroughly discussed numerous times. He says I'm an AH because all he did was go to his mothers house because she wanted to see him before he left and it wasnt his fault because his dad badgered him in to helping and wouldnt take no for an answer (his dad is super old fashioned). I still argued it's his fault that my trip was delayed by a day. AITA?

So I was walking my small dog (\~15 lbs/7 kg). We went to a local park - one that was meant for humans. Here, dogs must be leashed or otherwise under control - has good recall, not interested in other dogs/people, etc. Ever since an off leash dog bit mine about a year ago, I’ve carried citronella spray with me. It is not harmful, yet dogs absolutely hate the smell. So it makes for a good deterrent.

As we were entering the general area, an off leash dog ran up to mine. The owner was not there. It was way larger than her - about 30 lbs maybe. I immediately picked my dog up. I don’t know if it was reactive, aggressive, or just excited, but it was continuing to jump up on me in an attempt to get to my dog. After the previous attack, I was extremely cautious about dogs like this. So I pulled out the spray and used it on the dog. It hated it, pawing at its eyes and immediately running away.   


About a minute later, it came back leashed, with an angry owner. He was yelling at me for spraying his precious puppy. I told him that it was illegal for it to be off leash and that this was done in self defense. He called me an entitled a-hole and that this wasn’t called for. That his pup was just trying to be friendly. He then walked away without even apologizing. As my dog was extremely traumatized after that encounter, I yelled back that he was just lucky I wasn’t reporting him to animal control.

&#x200B;

I talked about it with some friends a few days later. They are also dog owners. They said that I could have just found the owner, and that I didn’t need to do this. They also said that they never would have done this. I began to think that I might be the asshole.

This happened 3 months ago but I recently saw my uncle for the first time post wedding. I have a MIL who is a nightmare and who despises me. my husband has set boundaries and she has set some of her own, so it is a very low contact right now but of course he wanted his mom at the wedding.

I have an uncle ""John"" who is very good with women, good looking, super charismatic, and everyone loves him. My mom and I approached John before the wedding and asked if he would wrangle MIL if she needed it. MIL is kind of like a boy crazy teen, so we thought it might work. I didn't have too much faith because 90% of the time she does whatever she wants anyway, but my mom was convinced it would work.

The day of the wedding, MIL started her bullshit. She was being passive aggressive and snarky and bringing down the mood. So my mom grabbed John who found an excuse to come into the room. He struck up a conversation with MIL, removed her from the room, and then they fucking disappeared. 

When it was time for the ceremony everyone was calling and texting and MIL finally answered her son and said she wasn't feeling well. My mom got a hold of John who had a bunch of vague excuses and said he wouldn't be coming back that night. My husband powered through it but I could tell he was upset. 

I later found out they were both lying, which I suspected, and they went to the beach and she slept over his house. I was furious on behalf of my husband. My mom texted John like wtf and John claimed he did his job and MIL didn't ruin the wedding did she.

Well I saw both of them recently at a birthday dinner for my great grandmother. My husband made a snarky comment to MIL about who knew she was alive because no one has heard a peep from her since that night. MIL laughed it off and John said see he did a great job of distracting her and she hasn't bothered us at all.

I snapped at him that he is an asshole and he ruined everything, probably to get laid. I said even he can't be this dumb to not now what I meant by distract her and that he is the reason she missed her son's wedding. I did calm down because I didn't want to be yelling at my great grandmother's dinner. John accused me of being dumb and insecure. He said he did his job and he isn't responsible for MIL leaving out of her free will.

My parents both passed away within a year of each other. I am in the process of buying my sister out of our family home and have recently paid her through the lawyer. I have never got along with my sister and now rarely see her or communicate with her. 

She recently asked the lawyer to ask me if I would top up a savings account for my niece which my dad had started. She felt that since her son got a saving account from my parents at 18 her daughter should receive the same ammount when she was 18. She pitched the idea that she would put in half the money and I should contribute the other half. She offered to let me pay it up if I didn't have the money on hand. It was around £5000 or $6600. 

I told the lawyer no. I didn't elaborate because if you give her a reason she see it as a place to start negotations but I didn't feel this is my responsibility and I don't have the money, even paying it up would take a chunk of change which I don't have.

I had to text her today about getting rid of some of my parents furniture. She asked about the savings account and I told her no. She replied she was very dissappointed but she would pay her half and ask her son to spilt the difference with his sister. 

I don't feel its her son's responsibility either, so the question is WIBTA if I reply that I am dissapointed that she is trying to pass her responsibilities firstly onto her sister but then even worse, onto her son.

My husband is vegan and became vegan after we had been married for a number of years. I decided to go vegetarian with him, he did not force me. We have an understanding about meat in the house.

even if I did decide to start eating meat again, I would not bring it into out house because it would hurt him emotionally. I made this choice willingly. I am not forced into it. In your case, you did NOT agree with it, so I see it as a totally different situation.

Insert obligatory ""throwaway account"" message here.

My (27M) girlfriend (28F) and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 1.  She announced a few months ago ""We're going to be vegetarians from now on.""  I flat out said, ""You can be, I'm not going to be"" because I like meat far too much to give it up. She insisted that yes, we were, and I finally gave up arguing with her about it. Now, since she does most of the cooking at home and we rarely go our for dinner, in practice it means we're vegetarian at home.  It doesn't stop me from grabbing a burger at lunchtime when I'm at work, but I don't bring that up to her. I'm not hiding it, but I'm not volunteering the information.

A week ago, she was going on a girl's night out with her friends, first time in a LONG time, and they were expecting to be very late. I told her to have a great time and I'd see her whenever she got home.

Here's where I may be kind of the asshole. She wasn't going to be home so instead of eating what we had in the house, I stopped off at the butcher, got myself a really nice steak, and slapped it on the grill.

I was in the middle of enjoying it when she came home unexpectedly early because one of her friends wasn't feeling well and they all decided to go again another night.  She saw the steak I was eating and started yelling at me for being an asshole and eating a steak when ""we're vegetarians!""  I told her that I had in no way agreed to being vegetarian and I could eat a steak in my own home if I wanted to, especially when she wasn't there.  I was pissed off because she was interrupting my dinner that I'd been looking forward to. She was REALLY unhappy with me and I ended up sleeping on the couch that night, and she's been cold to me ever since.

In my mind, I didn't do anything wrong, but she insists I'm an asshole for bringing steak into our house and eating it.  So what do you think reddit? AITA?

This story focuses on “A” (F30), a family friend that I have known for about 15 years. We met A becuase our parents became friends. I’ve never considered A my friend but I’m friendly when I see her. Though my mom and brother are very close friends with her. I have never really liked A. I thought she was annoying and we don’t have much in common. I really started to dislike her when 3 years ago she made comments to me about how my body is gross and my sister looks so much better then me. That really hurt my feeling and I really distanced myself from her. Now to the present I (F27) and my Fiancé (M27) got engaged a month ago and are getting married in a year. Last week when I stopped by my moms house A was there. She was asking a bunch of wedding questions and I told her that we had nothing planned besides the date and venue. She then told me not to worry about hair and makeup because that was my wedding gift from her becuase she’s a hair stylist. I thanked her for the offer but told her I was going to probably use the lady whose cut my hair for the last 5 years. She continued to insist that she was going to do my hair. After some back and forth, she dropped it, said she had to go and left. My mom was gushing how nice it was of her to gift me that. I told her it was rude of her to 1 invite herself to my wedding and 2 keep pushing when I politely declined. I told my mom that A is not getting an invite to my wedding for the reasons I explained above. Both me and my fiancé don’t like her and have both been clear that she was not getting invited. My mom was really offended that I was not inviting A. She ended up telling my brother A was not getting an invite, so he told his significant other that they were not getting his plus one and he was taking A instead because she deserves to go to my wedding becuase I’ve known her for 15 years. I told my brother that A could not be his plus one and if he is not bringing his girlfriend he’s not getting a plus one. I know my brother isn’t concerned about not having some one he knows at my wedding because 3 of his childhood friends have invites. Him and my mom don’t want A to feel left out so that was their solution to A not having an invite. So am I the asshole for telling my brother he can’t bring A as his plus one?

Me and my dad were supposed to make the dinner tonight, fries and steak. I found the steak but not the fries so I asked my parents if they didn't buy any new packages, and they said they did but we couldn't find them in the fridge. I was ready for there not to be any new fries, so I collected some potato croquettes that we already had that we could use instead. Then my mother found the fries, and put them next to the fridge. Because we had already put the croquettes on the counter, my dad and I somehow forgot about the fries we were supposed to use since they were next to the fridge so we then put the croquettes in the oven, and we completely forgot about the fries. 

My mom notices this when dinner is supposed to be served and she starts yelling and screaming at us because we used croquettes and she said it was disgusting to eat with meat. I said well, me and my dad clearly thought croquettes were suitable and that she can make her own fries. She went on this rant about how ""It's like saying ""we're going to make mac and cheese"" and then substituting the macaroni's for spaghetti. I don't want these croquettes, I wanted fries."".

I (19m) have only ever lived with women. My mom was a single mom and I have five sisters. I did college remotely last year, and took last semester off before finally transferring to an out of state school this semester. I sublet a house with three other guys who are all close friends. I’ve been hanging out with them more and more, but they’re closer with each other than me because I’ve only been here and known them like two months. 

One of my housemates, A, walks around the house with no clothes on. He’s not nude, he just wears boxers and nothing else. I don’t mind, as they’re just like shorts, but I’ve never seen or heard of anyone doing that. I asked one of my other housemates about it, and he thought it was weird I asked and said no one else questioned in. I asked A, and he said it was comfortable. He said if I had an issue he could throw on more clothes when leaving his room, but I said I didn’t because I don’t. 

One day I decided to try and fit in more (I know, I sound like I’m twelve) I left my room in just a sweatshirt and boxer briefs. But when I go downstairs, A is there (fully clothed) with his girlfriend and like five of her female friends. I awkwardly say hello, grab a cup of water, and walk upstairs. Was down there for less than a minute. I heard some nervous laughter when I go upstairs. When I check my phone a few minutes later, I saw that A had texted me that if he didn’t like the no clothes thing he could just tell me, but pulling a passive aggressive stunt like this is out of line. I also saw that last night I didn’t see a text in our house group chat that gave us a heads up he’d be having these people over. AITA?

I have very long, curly hair. For those that don't know, curly hair (especially long curly hair) is very high maintenance, it requires a good routine and dedication. I love my hair and it's a big part of who I am, I try to stay consistent with it. 

Me and my boyfriend were going on a trip, and I packed all of my stuff, including my hair products. When we got to where we were staying, I checked and all of my hair products were gone. I asked my boyfriend and he said that there wasnt enough space and to avoid bringing another bag, he took my hair products out as we could 'just get stuff whilst we're there'. I was quite mad, a lot of products would be hard to find and I like to keep to my routine. But as long as I have the basics I'll be fine, so I asked if we could get stuff tomorrow.

The next day we went for a long drive, and we stopped as he was feeling very hungry. He said that he'd get out of the car and get everything. I told him I'd come to get my hair products, but he insisted I stay as he wanted to leave quickly. I told him some good shampoos and conditioners to look for that would work on my hair and he went off. He came back very quickly, and I asked him if he found anything, he said yes. A few hours later when we got back, I checked what he got and it was a shampoo. A shampoo that was for straight hair and would be way too harsh for mine. And no conditioner. And if you think I'm being dramatic, you should see what my hair looks like after using a harsh shampoo. And I didnt want to put my hair up into tight styles, so I was kinda mad. I asked him if he couldn't find anything else and he told me that he was super hungry and in a rush but didn't think it'd matter as we could just share this shampoo... I was pissed. I told him he was selfish and didnt speak to him much the rest of that day. He said he felt like treated him badly. AITA?

You need to understand her and understand how to protect yourself with firm boundaries of you ever want a chance at a successful long term relationship.

Hopefully this will teach her a lesson about opening your mail and consuming something you bought. I’d be very tempted to start ordering weirder and weirder combinations of things just to fuck with her. You should apologize with the wording “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I bought sexy honey. I should have known that you would consume something, that I bought for me to better please my partner with. I’m glad it works so I now have a better idea of side effects because you had some.” In the future I would only buy your mom honey and bee related item. But that’s because I am an asshole.

Your ex is correct. I’m surprised your family hasn’t also discussed this with you. Your ex is not interfering with your current relationship but is concerned over a business that both of your dad’s run. In the end, the prenup benefits you and the business. If you were to get divorced, your eventual half share gets split. You will no longer be an equal partner with your ex. He would actually have more control because your shares would be split between you and your future husband. So to think that your ex is only thinking of himself is partially right, but it’s also protecting you and your family. 

Your fiancé is also in the wrong. Sure it’s great that he is taking an interest but is he an employee? If he does not work for the company why is he discussing the business with your ex? Your fiancé is not a shareholder so there is no reason to be talking about the business with your ex. Unless he is an employee or already a shareholder, the business is none of his business with anyone besides you. Talking and learning from you is one thing, trying to have input in a business that it sounds like he has right to have input in isn’t fair to anyone. 

You are wrong for not discussing the prenup as soon as talk of marriage came up. You and your family are the ones that stand to lose out if it doesn’t work out. Obviously I hope you and your fiancé have a wonderful life together and would never wish anything negative for your relationship. However, if you two were to divorce your shares will become diluted. Your half could be cut in half giving your ex and his family controlling interest in the business. I’m sure that’s not what your dad or you want.

A prenup isn't necessarily a bad idea in general and especially with you having something actually valuable you want to protect in the event of a divorce. 

The ex suggested it to you ages ago but you were like ""No! True love! We'll be together forever and can't tarnish our new marriage by dropping the 'd' word"" and ignored it due to offended honor or whatever. 

Your ex really should have dropped it then but I can see why he wouldn't if he thought this could end with the three of you being co-owners because you wouldn't just get something signed that if things went well would never matter promising he wouldn't steal your stuff. 

Then when your ex of all people decided it was his business to try and force the pre-nup like he had any right to do that of course the fiance guy angry! It's not his place to have that conversation! 

But I guess if he had exhausted any and all options to get you to worry about this yourself (did he try to talk to your dad? Was your dad not receptive?) he felt he had nothing to lose. It wasn't like asking was going to get him to not sign any more than him never having been asked. 

And it's only after your ex accused your fiance of only being with you for your money and demanded that he sign a pre-nup when the relationship had nothing to do with him (and might indicate to your fiance the ex isn't over you) and your fiance was angry about the situation that a lightbulb clicked and you're like ""Oh, I get it now! If our relationship is successful it doesn't matter if we have a pre-nup or not but if I don't get one I could lose half of everything I own!""

My dad and my ex’s dad are business partners. Currently both my ex and I have a small share in the business but we’re both expected to takeover once our parents retire and transfer their shares to us.

My ex is convinced my fiancé is only with me for money and the company. He has been insisting I ask him to sign a prenup beforehand to protect the company but I felt like it was insulting to him so I refused. However, my fiancé has recently gotten more and more interested in the company and it’s causing tension between him and my ex.

In one of their recent fights, my ex told him he would need to sign a to sign a prenup before we got married. My fiancé refused and asked my ex who he thought he was. My ex told him if he wasn't in it for the company, he would sign it, but my fiancé continued to refuse so my ex took it as confirmation for his doubts. I never said anything while they were fighting because neither of them listen to me anyway and I didn’t like my fiancé’s reaction to the idea of a prenup.

Once we went home, my fiancé was angry at me for not sticking up for him or defending our relationship. He also got even angrier after I told him I thought my ex was right and we should sign a prenup.

t6qzou,hzd7mu3,t3_t6qzou,I cant see how being business partners and still working together will go well for you with any relationship.

t6qzou,hzd87yl,t3_t6qzou,"I think NAH because I can understand it from every side. It’s a very very very reasonable request for your company to be protected via prenup by your business partner. I don’t think that’s a personal dig or because he’s your ex. It’s really logical and I recommend you do it. It wasn’t his place to bring it up to your fiancé, but I can see why he did: out of panic and out of you brushing the subject off. Your fiancés reaction is only a little tiny red flag. While I FULLY agree with the sentiment that if it wasn’t about the business he should have no problem signing it, remember that prenups can be so specific the only thing written into it is in regards to the business, which your fiancé may not know. It doesn’t have to dictate anything else in your marriage. 

He did probably feel blind sided and I can see why he’d want you to stick up for him, and of COURSE his extreme reaction would make your business partner see a huge confirmation to his fear. As for you not standing up for him, I can see why he’d want you to and you should have a moment of intersection here. Did you not do it because you actually kind of want one or deep down think it’s a good idea and you just don’t want to offend your fiancé? If you weren’t willing to really stand up and scream at the top of your lungs to anyone and everyone that this man is the love of your life and you trust him, I think it’s sort of a sign and your fiancé really picked up on that. Deep down, you know you should protect the company. Like I said, the prenup doesn’t need to protect anything else. 

My advice? Talk to BOTH dads about it. Get their perspectives. Then get on here and look up the word “prenup” and read every single horror story of people getting and not getting them. If your fiancé loves you, he’ll understand this BUSINESS decision and not take it personally. Discuss it with him too. Ask yourself if his reactions continue to give you the heebie-jeebies. Discuss it with a lawyer even, just a consultation. Ask them their opinion. 

It’s going to depend on how much you really care about this business. Are you really going to let your dad down because you’re afraid to upset someone and offend them? If your engagement falls apart simply because you’re fiancé is offended by you wanting to protect your business, or it’s so fragile that he doesn’t want the best for you and your business that it breaks over a simple and logical request, that’s not someone you want to marry. You want to marry someone that wants the best for you, and again, if it’s already THIS fragile that you could break up?

I suggest seeking a financial advisor. If he doesn't want you going over the statements, hire someone to go over all his statements and your statements (to be fair). Then, the final report and conversation is shared and you go to this person together.

Husband and I have been together for 15 years. About 3 years ago a massive bomb burst when I found out about $30k hidden debt. He incurred this debt to purchase more cryptocurrency and also give money to his parents who do not work...at this time his two siblings weren't helping at all and he couldn't either so he helped them on credit without my knowledge. We had just immigrated to a new country (AUS) a few months prior and I was pregnant with our second child. After this we agreed that he would pay his parents a set monthly amount which he could afford and nothing more. I repaid the debt and he took over about 70% of our day to day expenses since I moved to working part time after having baby no. 2. I am a corporate lawyer and always worked full time and paid most of our expenses but have cut back since having baby no. 2 and settling into a new country

We are comfortable financially and have overcome the issues of the past. He promised that there will be full transparency moving forward, but there has been no reason for me to ask to see anything until now: We are in the process of building a home and each agreed to save a set amount each month. I have saved my share (sometimes more) but its recently come to light that he has not been.

He earns a very good salary as a software testing manager so I just could not understand why. He is the spender between the two of us, so I asked that we go through his bank statements together to see where we could cut back on subscriptions etc. to help us reach our goals, but he refused saying that he does bot want to be policed and needs independence. 

I also know that his mother recently asked him for money again (he told me). His father passed away last year and she moved to the USA to be with his sister and has a job now, so he had stopped paying her the monthly amount as it was no longer necessary. He told me he has not given her money, but I doubt this since he does not want me to see his statements, and I did see on his computer screen (open whatsapp chats) that his sister sending him her banking details - very suspicious. When I asked he denied it and said that I just have to trust him. He has deleted all bank emails and changed his passwords. I am also worried that he may have bought more crypto or games (he is a pc gamer with an extensive Steam library).

I feel so powerless, I do not want to be this way - but in order for us to move forward and work together to achieve our financial goals, I think there should be full transparency. AITA?

We have a similar sort of situation in my family: One family member is a gambling addict (as well as just someone who pisses away money on junk, like getting takeaway food once or twice daily and buying mountains of romance books and shoes, which would be okay if it was occasional but not in these quantities) and often goes and gets new credit cards despite promising to ""cut them up"".

This person loves to throw tantrums about not having their privacy respected when they're forced to show their credit card statements but as we've explained to them, they lost the right to privacy in that regard when they got in the hole for tens of thousands of dollars with their family members had to pay off. Ultimatums are usually not something I'd suggest lightly, but in cases like this, I think it is reasonable to make full transparency with finances a condition of staying in the relationship.

This sounds like a pattern with them. 

I too have friends and family who are consistently late. This bothers me on multiple levels:

1. As an ADHD person, I struggle with time-blindness, and know what it's like to lose track of time and end up being late. I also know what it's like to deal with task management issues and be completely aware of the time, but unable to actually complete the steps to getting out the door and going to the appointment. I am also aware of how energy levels can fluctuate between when I committed to an outing and when the day of the outing arrived. So I am not unsympathetic to the many causes of lateness. That said, I am rarely late. I'm usually early.

2. Being early is how I combat lateness. The way I figure it, if I arrive early somewhere, then I can just sit around (in a hall, in my car) reading a book. It inconveniences no one but me. But if I'm late, I am signaling to my friends/ family that their time is (and by extension, they are) not valuable to me.

3. Because I feel hurt, disregarded, and as though I am not important to the people in my life when they are (substantially) late, or when they cancel last minute, I am sensitive to how my lateness can impact others. However, I am also aware that not everyone thinks of it this way. As we become more accepting of mental health awareness, many people consider their lateness and last moment cancellations to be a form of mental health self care. I am also very aware that this type of behavior tends to fall on social (family/ friend) interactions, because the unspoken expectation is that we will be more forgiving of lateness in social dynamics than in professional interactions. Therefore, certain friends and family are able to muster up the ability to arrive to interviews, classes, medical appointments, and work within a reasonable time frame, but will consistently deprioritize the time of their family and friends in the name of self care.

4. When someone is consistently late to social interactions, I will usually talk to them about it and let them know it's bothering me. I'll explain that I sympathize and why, and how I deal with my own time blindness and social exhaustion. I'll ask what solutions they're currently implementing, and if there's anything they would like me to do when we arrange get togethers. For example, would they like me to give them a different start time? Would they prefer arranging day-of get togethers (shorter notice, less time to plan?). I do well with calendaring in advance with set plans, but some people prefer more spur of the moment interactions.

5. Sometimes, despite my best efforts, I am late. When I am late, I text or call the affected party to apologize, notify them of my lateness, and estimated time of arrival.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646504208.0

I’m 31F and I had plans to have afternoon tea in the park via this special booking I arranged with my friends weeks ago. They knew the booking was at 11:45 and I asked if we could all meet by the entrance by the park’s train station at 11:30. They all agreed to this and even asked that I bring my husband and my dog along before (I live the closest to this park) so they could meet the dog and then my husband could take the dog back home when it was time for the afternoon tea. (Dogs aren’t allowed in the cafe) and I even reminded them yesterday to please meet me at the train station entrance to the park at 11:30, again they said they would make it. 

I also told them my dog has a poorly paw but I would get the bus to the park with the dog and my husband so they could meet him anyway, minimising the dog’s time on his feet. Again they said that’s fine. 

Come the day of and no one showed up until 11:50 and none of them got up in time to take the train and had to take Ubers or get lifts which took them all to other areas of the park. In the end my husband and my dog just left and I sat alone holding the table waiting for my friends. When they showed up I told them to have a nice time but that I was too upset and left, and now I’m crying on my bus ride home. 

I know I’m an idiot for getting upset but even when we meet up in the city and I’m the one who travels, they’re still always late and I’m still always the one sat alone holding the table. And it was really important to me that they finally meet my dog and they seemed really excited too. Now I’m just feeling like I’m an idiot for bothering to wake up early ish on a Saturday, get ready, get my dog ready for the bus, make my husband come with us, only for them to again be late.

Oh and I did offer to book this afternoon tea in the park at a later time in the day on another day, it’s just that today only had the opening at 11:45, but my friends said it would be fine and that they would make it.

I am really confused about this situation. My girlfriend agrees that I wasn't in the wrong, but I can't get it out of my mind.

I recently joined a fitness center (FC). There are two pools, a lap pool with 4 lanes and a therapy pool.

The incident happened yesterday in the lap pool. I got in and went to the first lane, closest to the entrance. There was no one else in the pool at the time. I started my workout- just a breast stroke, using the black line as a guide. I'm not an Olympic athlete, but I enjoy swimming and I don't think I make a fool of myself in the pool.

8 or 9 laps later, I stood to take a break at the shallow end of the pool (goes from 3.5-5ft). There was now a 50-ish guy in the lane next to me. He tapped me on the shoulder and I jumped when he touched me. He told me to ""swim on the other side of the lane,"" away from him.

While I was trying to figure out what he meant and why, he said that I was ""weaving all over the place,"" and ""making it hard to concentrate"", because I was hitting the rope. I got red and flustered, I tried to respond but didn't say anything. He looked at me and goes, ""Well?!,"" sighed and took off down his lane.

I looked over at the lifeguard (LG) but she didn't look at me. I went back to my swim but I kept my head above water. Away from the guy, I tapped the rope and realized I couldn't hit the rope without knowing.

I swam to the shallow end and the guy was there again, in his lane, waiting. I ignored him. He said, ""Hey, I'm serious"" and I looked at him, told him there was no way I could have hit the rope or crossed into his lane. I said he could use another lane. He responded that I shouldn't use the pool if I didn't ""swim right.""

I was upset, so I got out of the pool, to go sit in the hot tub and calm down. I had to walk past the LG. I approached her to ask if she observed me and the guy in the pool. She said she saw us talking and asked what happened. I told her what the guy said and she said she didn't see me cross the lane line. I said thanks and went to go into the locker room, where the hot tub is located. As I turned I saw the guy get out and talk to LG. Whatever she said pissed him off. I went into the locker room and got in the hot tub.

A couple minutes later, the LG came in and was looking for someone. I figured it was me so I waved. She came over and said the guy had accused me of kicking him repeatedly and swearing at him.

I told her none of that is true and she agreed that hadn't seen me do anything wrong. She asked if I wanted to file a complaint, I said yes. I got out, dressed and went to the front desk, like LG said to do. I did a complaint form. The LG said that the manager would follow and give the guy a warning- 3 in 6 months means suspension. I thanked them and left.

But now, I am wondering if I should have responded differently. Is there some unknown rule I broke? Should I contact the manager and rescind my complaint?

Hello. I own a Discord community server of 350k members, a few weeks ago someone sent me a DM about being interested in buying an ad.

We discussed some details, and I told them about how we had 350k members plus 20-30k members online daily, so the ad reach would've been good.

They told me they were willing to pay 300usd for the ad, and after a bit more discussion they were confident enough to send me the money.

Once I got the money, I post the ad (exactly as it was written by them) on the server, days passed and the ad wasn't very succesful as it didnt gave them many joins to their server (which was the point of the ad).

They message me again, telling me how I was a liar and  a scammer because the ad didn't do well because only a few hundred people joined, but with my member count it should have been more. They asked me for the money back but I refused because I had already sent our staff their share. 

We discussed some more, and I ended the conversation by saying that I did my part. I posted the ad, I made sure to mention the whole server so everyone would have a notification on the ad, etc. But thats about how far i can control things, i dont have power on people and cant force them to join a server if they aren't interested. The reach was there, but i guess it wasn't interesting enough for people to actually join. 

After saying that, i just stopped replying. AITA? im not sure what else i could have done.

It’s also probable that he wasn’t reacting to intelligence, but some other contrast, such as generally controlled demeanor.

I (35M) am Autistic. It obviously affects my life but I pretty good in social situations, I have a job, am not really super smart, so I guess people who have never encountered an Autistic person before compare me to Rain Man and are kinda like, wtf? 

I was introducing myself to my cousin's boyfriend (never met before), he went in for a hug, I didn't go in for one and my mom kinda chimes in like 'oh he's autistic he doesn't like hugs' and my cousin's boyfriend goes 'really because he doesn't act autistic' which pissed me off and I excused myself. 

My cousin came to find me and she was upset with me and said I acted childish by leaving because what he said wasn't all that offensive but I felt it was and I thought that by leaving for a few minutes it'd actually be more mature than getting angry over something small.

That statement ""but you don't act/look autistic"" IS offensive. But he is also bold to assume he can notice it after ONE ALMOST HUG.
Instead of getting angry at you, she should have comfronted her boyfriend about it. 

Is it alright if I don't like it that your mom immediately told him that you don't want to hug because your autistic? She could've just told him you don't like hugs or prefer other ways to greet someone. It feels like it should be you that has to tell him if you're comfortable with him knowing that information and that your mom outed you immediately.

I'm glad you have someone good to help you because it can make such a world of difference.

If you want a diagnosis for whatever reason or might need accommodations at work, it could be useful to get. I didn't mean to sound like I was discouraging you if I did. I just wasn't prepared for how difficult it would be to find assistance after I was diagnosed, so I wanted to give a heads up.",7,0,0,False,False,False,1646470943.0
t6vxzf,hzfvq4u,t1_hzfr7ja,"It made things click and gave me a launching point for looking into how others dealt with it. I have the diagnosis to point to if I ever need to request accommodations specifically related to my autism as opposed to my depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. It has helped a bit in fine tuning some aspects of my therapy for my other conditions as I was able to say I wanted someone with experience with autistic people when my previous therapist moved on.

Also, one of my favorite benefits, I get to participate in research done on people with autism (through Spark for Autism). It also gives me a different perspective on certain members of my family.

A sort of one off benefit I got one day was when I was taking an Uber to my gp, and the driver asked what my service dog was for (autism and anxiety), and he told me about how his child is autistic and asked me about whether I have a job (I do) and relationships (I'm married) and whether my dog helped me (definitely). When we arrived at my doctor's office, he told me I gave him hope for his child's future, especially because they were an immigrant family and people didn't really talk about autism where they were from.

It is a cost/benefits analysis that'll be different for different people. Would I have pursued a diagnosis if I still lived in the small town in rural Virginia where I grew up? Maybe, but it would've been harder. I can practically guarantee I would've had to go at least an hour away for testing. Instead I live just outside Washington, DC and got super lucky and had to walk less than a block.

While it took me awhile to find it (mostly because it didn't exist [at least for adults] when I was first diagnosed), I did finally find a location that would provide therapy specifically tailored to helping with my autism, though I couldn't get it because it wasn't covered by my insurance and I couldn't afford it otherwise. They have locations in 24 states across the US and are called CARD (Cenrer for Autism and Related Disorders).

Edit: I see now you were replying to my comment where I already mentioned CARD. I'd just like to note that while I've heard good things, I'm not trying to push them. They just are one of the few places I know of that treat adults with autism.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646479208.0

Me (19F) and my boyfriend (22M) have known each other for a few years growing up as his older sister is married to my uncle . We developed feeling for each other about over a year now when I decide to to spend 2 years in my homeland . Now it’s a Muslims country but not insanely conservative . But you do have to send marriage proposals through parents . 

Now a few weeks ago he told his mum about us who sent a marriage proposal . He didn’t tell me before he did it . And now they want me to get engaged this year and married next year . And I said that I like him but want to finish my education . His mum is really adamant on the marriage and I feel really weird about it . (Both of her daughters got married at 27 after finishing their education and starting work ) Like I’m really young and want to be single for a few years and focus on becoming something to take care of my dad who’s divorced and can’t work cause he’s old and has a lot of medical issues . 

He himself wants me to marry him soon . Recently we got into an argument cause some girl who liked him sent him pictures from my story on instagram (after cropping them ) of me with a male friend whose younger than me (underage but he’s my sisters friend ) and saying we were alone (we were like 5 people )and she took the picture . And he was ready to leave me over it without ever asking me about it . So I told him honestly that I wasn’t ready for marriage or kids and wasn’t sure about being with him and he said I was a bad person for trying to leave him after he sent a proposal , ignoring that he almost dumped me

I will keep this brief, cuz I don't think it's that complicated, but it might be a more cultural thing. 

So my parents, siblings, and I all live separately. My 2 siblings live close to each other, while I live close to our parents. Also, I live in the area where they are working, often do some other stuff, etc.

The problem I have is that they call to see me when they are already in the area. Visiting the parents, or finishing something up. They would call and be like ""hey, we are here why don't you come so we can see each other"" or ""hey, are you home we would drop by"". And when I ask ""When?"", they would be like ""Oh, we are already here"", or ""we are there in 10 minutes"". 

I already asked them not to do that, to at least tell me that they are planning on coming so I can organize. That didn't go as well and the ""problem"" continued. And when I say that I can't they are like ""oh, what is the reason"", ""what r u doing"", ""c'mon, leave that this will be brief"", etc.

I find this really annoying. Sometimes I have other plans, sometimes I just don't feel like getting ASAP ready and going out, or having someone come by. I am introverted by nature so that also has some effect on it, and that is why I need a 3rd party view on this. Would this be acceptable to you and your relationship with siblings or maybe close friends?

&#x200B;

(and I'm writing this while I'm waiting on them right now. One of them called 10 minutes ago,  and asked if I'm available. And I'm going out to see them now, because amongst other things I have a problem with saying NO to people, especially those close to me). Also, I found myself not wanting even to answer the phone when they call me, because I know what is the situation.

First post removed as it was too long. 
My mother spreads gossip like butter on toast and neither me nor SIL have been able to make pregnancy announcements after mother finds out. Mother also likes to be venomous behind your back as well as to your face. She never visits us as I refuse to pay her to anymore. 
When I was unexpectedly pregnant with my daughter, I didn’t tell her. I have a genetic issue that meant my daughter would likely die/haemorrhage. I didn’t want to tell people who were congratulating me that my baby passed. So I didn’t tell people. I did tell my gran, who asked me to tell mother - but I didn’t. 
When my baby was born, all planned out and induced ahead of time she was taken straight to special care and hooked up to four machines, I told mother then. When she was born alive. Mother immediately started calling people and found out that my gran already knew. She. List. Her sh*t. Beelzemum then called my eldest and threw abuse at her for not saying anything and then called me and threw abuse for not telling her. I told her my daughter was about to have a blood transfusion and she said “I don’t know what you expect me to do about it”. I decided to go NC. Since then she has made up rumours and spread them through the family, and none of my family are speaking to me. My gran says it’s because of “the way  X came in to the world” meaning I didn’t tell mother. 
There were pics on fb of a very pregnant me and if she’d ever visited she’d have noticed. AITA for not telling her I was pregnant?

I have been married for 15 years. My husband’s sisters never wanted us to date or get married. They do petty things like forget to include me in Christmas gift exchanges or plan family events when they know I will be working. One year they wanted to go on a family beach vacation and asked me about my work schedule. I told them I could be off any time except the week of July 4th so of course they planned it for the week of July 4th (they are self employed and make their schedules). At our wedding they started a betting pool on how long we would be married (apparently 2 years was the max bet). My husband didn’t have a Facebook until recently and said he started one because that is where I post and he wanted to follow and like my posts. He immediately friended his sisters. I told him I would rather them not be able to see things I post as “friends of friends” but he refused to unfriend them so I unfriended him.

However, it's your husband, and although Facebook is just insignificant social points, I do think it says you guys have to work on some things if you're symbolically 'unfriending' him. There's got to be some deep seated resentment from him not backing you up.

Like others said before, block the sisters before unfriending the hubby. You guys have to start learning to be an unbreakable unit, and unfriending him is another step to making that harder. He also needs to man up and have your back first, not his sisters'.

t72ym4,hzgv2uu,t3_t72ym4,"NTA. As others have posted, it isn't about Facebook. Your husband has gone along w/ his sister's abuse of you for 15 years. You being abused is less important to him than not rocking the boat w/ his sister's. Then he punishes you for trying to protect yourself from the abuse by doing things like guilt tripping you into unblocking them or not talking to you for days. This is not OK behavior. Not taking to you for days over something like this is an abusive tactic. He is actually ACTIVELY insisting they get an additional chanel for abusse that you had previously cut off. This is the 2nd time he actively aided their abuse w/ Facebook alone and he is doing it by turning to manipulative or abusive tactics himself. I can't imagine the 100's of other ways he has assisted them in the past - like, attending the family events that the sisters deliberately scheduled so you couldn't come, for example.

The sister's won't stop unless there are consequences or you leave your husband. Your husband does the opposite of making  consequences - he punishes you to help them. I have no idea what would make you important enough to him change what he is not only allowing to happen, not only assisting to happen, but actively participating in.

Bullys & abusers have an uncanny ability to either find people who will take it, wither due to past abuse, low self-esteem, un-equal power dynamic or they break people down so they will put up with it. It isn't you fault you are being bullied/abused, but you need to get some therapy to figure out why you have put up with this situation for so long. If therapy isn't an option, there are tons of books that discuss these dynamics. You need to think long and hard about what you want, where you draw the line and what you are willing to put up with for the rest of your life. 

You need to realize you deserve someone who cares about your emotional well being, who will protect you from and help you stand up to people who want to hurt you.

Becareful with your husband, he clearly doesn't think bullying/abusing you is a big deal and uses the tactics himself. You will want to make sure you have someplace lined up to go if he escalates the tactics.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646498580.0

Sorry if I don't give many details, privacy and all that.

Long story short: I've been volunteering at a Pet Hotel since November. In January my dad died and in February the owner of the hotel was attacked (and other things that happened in November)

We have both been very upset but since she suffered her thibg I've been managing the hotel, and acting as her choufeur, therapist and friend. She's applied to her private health insurance for paid leave, but at the same time I kept the hotel going.

Yesterday there was a confusion with some clients (on me, not dejecting blame) and we were at full doggie capacity + 3 small dogs is the various section (she has done this before, so I thought it was doable). She left yesterday afternoon some passive-agressive notes in the office for when I got back there to walk the doggies in the various section and wrote a post-it for her saying I didn't deserve passive aggressive notes for doing my best.

You see, I've been treating her like I treated my mom when dad died, I've taken her to appointments, made sure she took care of herself, getting her public mental health support, bought supplies for both her and the hotel, carrying EVERYWHERE the hotel's mobile phone, taking reservations, managing the place like it were mine and my name were on the line. I've been crying every day because I can't cope anymore.

Today, she came in the hotel and started scolding me for things I didn't even do, so I told her she had 2 options: trusting me, and that I want the best for the hotel and the animals; getting off of paid leave and get back to managing the hotel her way. She kept yelling at me and my fiancé (who is volunteering to help me with the hotel) told her I've gone to infinitum and beyond and he is not letting her treat me like that because I was loud crying and hyperventilating.

She took the keys from me and told me not to come by anymore. I feel broken, a bad person, thinking about the doggies and how much I miss them. I'd love to keep working at the hotel, but I'm not up for being treated like crap. Fiancé says her being a victim does not give her free way to misstreat me.

AITA for not taking any more crap from her?

That might be what you want, but make sure before you go forward.  

If you decide not to, then you state to everyone that what they did was wrong and until they pay you for what they destroyed on purpose to be cruel… And then set it boundary.  Maybe you won’t attend gatherings they attend, maybe it is not acknowledging them… you can separately see the members of your family you love.  

What they did was awful, years of awful before that.  I am sorry that they have been such terrible people and that your family does not stand up for what is right.",7,0,0,False,False,False,1646502016.0

i (NB21) am disabled, i Bought myself these fancy ass glasses because I wanted to be able to style them with anything and feel myself in em. i do need the glasses ALL the time currentlyI’m wearing my old glasses for reading and close sight, can’t drive anywhere so I’m stuck at home.   
My cousins S(20) & k(19) along with my aunt (43) hate me, I don’t care but I still go to family gatherings for my 4 siblings and parents. For the past 2 years almost 3 my cousins and aunt have been non stop stalking and harassing me, 

I came down to my grandparents house for a dinner with the family I hadn’t seen in a good bit and everything is ok a few snarky comments are thrown my way and I just shrug em off then one of em said something about my job, (I run my own business)and I casually said “atleast I didn’t need mommy and daddy’s money” my aunt straight up snatches my glasses off my face and I can’t see anything but blur, I try getting em back pissed off as my aunt and cousins are running around tossing em,  then I hear the sound of my glasses snapping . My mom tells me my cousin and aunt pulled the legs and broke em off then my other cousin stepped on them. To witch my cousins say “no we didnt  we dropped them and mom stepped on them” idc who broke them I couldn’t see I can’t work and I can’t drive or go outside on my own,   I said “you can either pay for my glasses along with the extra cost” because I can’t get more then one pair a year on my insurance “or I’m suing“ then everyone’s yelling and screaming at me. Except my mom wh stays out of this shit my lil sisters on my side my oldest lil bro is to but my other 2 brothers are also iffy about picking sides my dad says I’m bbeing ridiculous and shouldn’t wear my expensive glasses out and should just buy cheap ones. So I call my lover to pick me up and take me to our home, which is a 2 hr drive luckily They were only 30 minutes away at their parent my sister had recorded the interaction of my aunt taking my glasses til they broke . the last thing I say is “you have a week or I’m pressing charges and suing” I don’t know if can even press charges but it sure scared em my dad told me not to and says “your grandparent doesn’t have much time left with us let it go“ my aunt calling me screaming and calling me slurs  my cousins attacking me on social media and my mom rarely Speaking to me Because I caused drama.   
I feel like I’d be the asshole for suing because they are family and my grandparent doesnt have much time With us and stirring up more drama will just cause everyone to dislike me more

what do y’all think

I (24F) have been dating my current boyfriend (30M) for almost two years now. Since we have been together I have made him aware several times of the fact that I do not like breakfast foods or my food being mixed together. He has even had conversations about how I do not like breakfast to several other people saying how weird I am. I would just prefer some bacon by itself. I also work two jobs with very long hours and like to catch up on sleep on the weekends. He tries to be sweet and will occasionally bring me breakfast in bed but gets upset when I do not eat all of it. I have tried to explain several times I appreciate the gesture because I know most men don’t do this kind of thing but I really do not like breakfast food or eating early in the morning or my food touching. He makes lots of omelets and sandwiches. He gets very upset by this and says it’s a wasted gesture on his part and doesn’t talk to me for the rest of the morning. He continues to try to make me eat breakfast in bed and getting upset I don’t eat it when he is aware I do not like breakfast. Am I the asshole for not eating breakfast?

The next time you see him, you need to sit down and take the follow steps:

1. Calmly, you say: ""I really appreciate you cooking for me, it's very sweet, but I want to make it clear- I do not like breakfast foods and I don't like my food mixed together. 
2. Give some examples: ""I like bacon, I do not like omelets, I prefer to just have some coffee and get my day going, but at lunch I like X, Y, Z."" 
3. Then you look him in the eye and say: ""Do you understand that I am telling you that I do not like breakfast in bed when it is things I cannot eat? I need you to tell me that you understand and that you will not try and force me to eat things that I do not like, nor will you get mad when you make me something you KNOW I do not like and I don't eat it.""
4. Then you ask him: ""What am I missing here? Why is to so important for you to try and force feed me food I don't like?""

That's it. He has decided that he is doing a nice thing, regardless of whether you actually want it or like it. This is a big of a flag, because he is like ""this is the nice thing I do, how unbelievable that I will not be considered a hero for this thing"" and he cannot fathom that you are an independent human and he may have to tailor his Super Nice and Romantic Grand Gestures of Food The Way I Like It, to be you know...something you actually like.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646508536.0

This is odd behavior. He's either ignoring your preferences (rude) or He's making a power play. It's not cute or kind. Punishing you by being cold or distant because you don't give in to his desires for you to eat what he wants you to eat when he wants you to eat it despite your own preferences is a red flag. Repeating this behavior over and over is another red flag 🚩 

I'd tell him in no uncertain terms that if he wants to do something nice for you then he needs to find another way. Tell him that you've tried to be polite about it up until this point but that you are going to start resenting him if he continues to ignore your preferences. If he argues with you and insists on trying to change you and punish you when you don't fall in line then I'd reconsider the relationship. He sounds exhausting and careless at best and controlling at worst. 

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that you throw the whole man away over this without giving him the chance to make it right.

I (18M) am a freshman in college, and my roommate (19M, we'll call him Brad) is someone that I wasn't friends with, but knew in high school. We decided stay in a dorm room together because we didn't want to risk going random. He was nice enough in high school, but in college I saw him for who he really is. He makes so many racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, etc. jokes that even Archie Bunker would tell him to chill. He's an only child, and I don't think his parents adequately taught him how to live with someone. He never cleans out the microwave, has woken me up more times than I can count with lights and making noise, lets his crappy friends stay with little more than a few hours' notice (we both have lofted beds, and a futon beneath my bed), and generally doesn't have regard for the fact that it's OUR room, not just his. I've been cordial so far, but I'm at my limit.  

When Brad asked about me leaving at 8pm Saturday night so he could have a girl over, I was initially fine with it, because I had time and options to stay elsewhere. Things changed when I found out that a) I have three pretty big exams back to back this coming week, and b) my best arrangements are positioned in a way that forces me to stay out of my own room for almost 24 hours, since I'd have to be in my friend's apartment by 3 because she has work, and it's likely this girl wouldn't be gone until well after noon on Sunday. Friday night, I texted Brad, saying that I was sorry for making him change his plans, but I would be coming back to the room at midnight instead of the next day like we planned. I felt bad for changing it so soon, but he has an entire day to make changes if necessary, he had 4 hours to himself in our room, and I would be 100% okay with the girl staying the night, so that all that has to change is that they don't start ""doing it"" while I'm asleep.

At first Brad thought I was joking, because I think he got used to pushing me around. When I confirmed that this was how I felt, he got pretty aggressive and started personally attacking me, so I hung up. All of my friends are defending my stance, saying it's outrageous to expect me to carve such a massive chunk out of my weekend so he can have a girl over, ESPECIALLY when I have three exams and I want to be as ready as possible by getting good sleep in advance. Plus, he rarely wakes up before noon on weekends, so there's no way I have a chance at even showering until tomorrow afternoon. His friends immediately started hounding me, saying I was being a c\*ckblocker. The part where I feel like an AH is that I didn't give him a lot of time to change things, but at the same time, 4 hours is plenty of time to do whatever you want in the dorm room, and I stressed that she can absolutely stay the night, she doesn't need to scramble for different sleeping arrangements, so not much is changing.

I'm currently sitting in Starbucks trying not to panic, and I'm cutting a LOT out, but AITA?

They are bullies. They are committing abuse. 

You need to find a way to live elsewhere, which, tbf, I know is impossible in this day and age. In the meantime, find ways to avoid your family members while living there. Set your boundaries, and keep setting them. If you can, talk them into joining you for group counselling sessions, so that a third, objective, party can explain how what they are doing, is abuse. (Yeah, I'm pretty sure last last one is an impossibility).  If you can get just one person to join you in therapy, they might become an ally, and help to get the others turned around. 

Setting boundaries with your brother is really important here. This behaviour will become normalized if encouraged by your family.

*Some context, I have a bad phobia of other people's bodily fluids.  It's not bad enough for a panic attack but it is bad enough to where I have to leave the table to dry heave. My entire family knows this and takes great pleasure in making fun of me for this. They've never gone out of there way to show me anything that would trigger my phobia, just poking fun.*

*About two weeks ago, I was hanging out with my family and joking around. I'm not really sure what led up to this but my step mom, followed by my step siblings and dad, started encouraging the 5 year old to lick me. They laughed as he chased me around*

Ask your family what's so fun about bullying somebody who has a phobia. Ask why it was so hilarious to have a five year old chase a grown man around so that the child could lick him. Wait for their answers. Remind them that the child may not know how to adapt his behavior to the situation and if he goes around licking people, especially at school, they will be getting a call about the child 'sexually harassing other children' .

Your phobia is not something that you should be teased about or bullied for. If it interferes with your life, you should seek out therapy for it otherwise it should be left alone. Inform your family, that starting today, you will longer tolerate their teasing (bullying0 about your condition. If it happens again, you will leave and put them on a time out.

So basically, my roommate and I (both 23F) have known each other for 4 years now. We roomed together two years of college and after college we decided to get an apartment together. We've never had any issues and we have opposite schedules so were rarely home at the same time and its nice. 

Recently, there's been an issue with the wifi and we've been trying to get our provider come and fix it. Apparently there's a $75 fee to have someone come out so she preferred that we tried to fix it on our own first. Now, we're pretty close friends so I know all of her friends and we've all hung out on occasion, she games a lot so most of her friends are from playing games online. She explained to me that one of her friends was gonna come over and try to fix it for us, I said no problem that's fine.

So flash forward to last week and I got home early from work to see her male friend (33M) who I've never met before in our apartment alone trying to fix the wifi. At first I freaked out cause I had no idea who he was and he said he was her friend. When I asked how he got in he said he picked up her key from her at work and got in. I texted her saying that I was upset she didn't tell me he was going to be at the apartment alone, not to mention its a friend I've never met before. She told me they've been playing games online together for a year and he's harmless but I still told her that wasn't okay. She was upset that I was being so dramatic about it and I told her she's not allowed to have anyone over when she's not there. Still she was really upset saying he was just trying to do something nice for us and apparently she told him I was uncomfortable and now he doesn't like me as well.

While I understand her side, I don't know this guy and I feel uncomfortable having a random guy whose also 33 and much older than us alone in our apartment. Who knows he could've made a copy of the key or something or stolen things! But AITA for making such a big deal about it? We haven't talked in a week and she's had him sleep over several times just to spite me. They're not dating, in fact she has a boyfriend of 2 years, I just don't know whether I'm in the wrong or not.

1) I would clarify that your step daughter now has the benefit of two moms - so she doesn’t have to pick or choose. 

2) If you did tell her that her mother is not cut out to be parent materiel that is a big no-no. Trash talking the other parent regardless of their behavior can lead to your child resenting you when she is no longer upset at her mother. And that time probably will come, where her and her mother will fix their issues and she will remember the things you said about her mom. Try to have grace when speaking about her. 

3) I would try to discuss with your husband the issues your stepdaughter is having with her mom before giving her more advice. It doesn’t sound like you really know this woman at all. And from personal experience teenage girls and their mothers butt heads like no other. It may not be her mother causing issues and it may be her. I know I could make my mother out to be the villain at that age when I was just a hormonal wannabe adult. I’m not saying she’s lying I’m just saying this time can be rough and not knowing the situation can make it worse. 

You saying that you are replacing her mom was an AH move. You are a mom to her and that’s important, it’s just different and definitely not the same as her actual mother. Your husband probably could’ve handled this better but he obviously feels like you overstepped boundaries. If he had already laid out those boundaries with you and you knowingly overstepped them that again would be another AH move.

But the problem isn’t about you and her; and tbh, you put your SD in an awful position because she won’t be able to share about her mom now, without maybe her feeling that she’s going to alienate you.

I (43F) have three biological kids (10M, 8F, and 1M.) My youngest son's father is my husband (45M), and my older kid's father isn't around anymore. My husband also has other kids (17F and 15F), so i'm their stepmom, and I really enjoy having all the kids around.

I have pretty good relationships with both my kids and my stepdaughters. But recently, my 15 year old stepdaughter was being more quiet than usual. I mean, she's always been the one to talk less than everyone else, but this time I felt like she was upset or something. 

So, about a week ago, I had went up to her room and asked her if anything was wrong, and she just told me school was stressing her out and that was it. I didn't fully believe that, so I told her if there was anything wrong, she could talk to me about it whenever she felt like it then left her alone for a while. 

A few days after, after coming home, she asked if we could talk. I was really surprised she actually wanted to talk to me about whatever was bothering her, because she always wants to handle things on her own. We went to a part of the house where no one else was, and she ended up telling me about her actual mom. Apparently this has been an issue her whole life, but she was upset because her mom seems to love her sister more than her and a lot of things like that. I won't go too into detail (for privacy reasons) but apparently her mom is a pretty trashy parent. 

She seemed close to crying but then said how she sometimes wished that I was her real mom. I was glad to know that she thought of me in that way, but at the same time it was heartbreaking. Everyone deserves loving parents. I told her that if she wanted to consider me as her mom, then she could, because obviously her mother isn't cut out to be a parent. 

Not long after, my husband found out about our conversation and he told me ""my daughters have only ONE mom, you can't replace her."" Then he went on about how his ex is an amazing parent, and that it's not my job to be a mom to the girls. 

I know that I have no right saying anything bad about my husband's ex, and it probably wasn't a good idea to replace my stepdaughter's mom. This is my first time on the subreddit and I want someone to tell me if I'm the one in the wrong, so aita?

First time poster here! I (24f) co-signed a car for a friend Tara (24f), a month ago. I am fully aware now how bad of an idea this was, and will never be doing something like this again. 

So anyway I am the primary on the car as she needed to trade her old one in and get something safer for her and her child.  The agreement was that she will be on the car for 6 months to build her credit and get the payments lower, this was stated both verbally and written via text as well. So 6 months rolls around and she’s says she needs to get it refinanced. 
More time passes I start making comments about it and now we are finally at 8 months. 

I need to get a new car since mine  has become almost undeliverable. I start pressuring here hey we need to get on this on Monday, I text her that night she didn’t have time. I go over to here place Tuesday and start doing online applications for her while she just sits and plays on phone. Wednesday she basically gets denied for every one as her credit score is a 562. 

I tell her well at this point I found a car and am having them hold it because I need her off my credit. On Thursday I tell her her options are refinance with a co-signer, trade it in for a cheaper car or put a down payment of 1000 for a local credit union who will even lower the car payments. Neither of these options are good enough for her. 

Friday rolls around and I am getting stressed bc she won’t do anything. I message her again and tell her these options again. That I need her to do this today bc it’s been 8 months and we agreed on 6. I brought up that she had 8 months to build her credit and did nothing about it. Then she says she doesn’t mind helping me, but she isn’t going to drop everything to do this since she has to move out in a couple of months and that I need to calm myself. That it’s sad I’m using that I signed her on my car and am holding it over her head, that I’m throwing low “jabs”. I again reiterated we had an agreement and I’m holding her to it. Then she called me a bitch. Then texted me 4 hrs later that the car is refinanced and I need to sign the POA which I went to the bank and already have done. 

Am I wrong for being adamant about getting it changed out of my name suddenly bc I now needed a car for myself?

So im gonna try to keep this short but theres some thing yall need to know

I (27f) have been with my fiance (33m) for 6 years, we live together we plan on marrying in a year or 2 etc my fiance is chronically ill hes able bodied but hes in pain the majority of the time some days it's fine others its unbearable. He also has some facial scarring from other stuff.

My mom remarried when I was 19 i like her husband he treats her good hes nice etc I was already out of the house when they married so I dont have much of a relationship with him. Like I said hes great now his family is iffy his kids are wonderful I love my step brothers they are so fun and lively, but his brother (who I'll call SU step uncle) is something else hes well off and hes probably the most entitled person I've met, every year he hosts a family dinner ,I normally dont go since my step brothers dont but as they were going I decided free food why not.

The party comes and me im seated at SU ""personal"" table along with my step brothers mom etc. People are talking whole eating and SU start talking to me asking me how my careers going hows life etc then he asks how my fiance's doing I say hes ok and tired to change the topic he then said that he cant imagine how hard it is to be a caretaker I said I wasnt we went back and forth for  a bit an I told him to drop it he did but then said ""listen if you want to ruin your life with that scarface then go ahead but you should find a man like me"" I stood and said ""I want a husband not something with an ego so small he feels threatened by someone half his age my fiance is more a man then you can ever dream to be he worked for his life while daddy bought yours"" I walked out if the party and apparently he had a fit about me disrespecting him in his own home how he was just trying to help but I'm a crazy b who can't see reason.
My fiance and step brothers are on my side but my mom and step father are saying I could've been the bigger person and walked away my mom told me shes really disappointed in my reaction and hasnt talked to me since (dinner was Wednesday)

I feel a small bit guilty because I did CHOOSE to go to the dinner wasn't like I was forced and it was his house but he was nasty so I was nasty back

AITA for causing a scene at my SU dinner?

backstory, im (19 F) brazilian and I flew to denver with my parents to meet my baby cousins for the first time. I was out and about with my family, my parents wanted to buy ice cream for my cousins and while they were there I went to this local coffee shop next to the ice cream shop. While I was ordering this woman (probably in her late 30’s, white if that matters) noticed my accent (I speak fluent english but I still have a accent bc I dont live in the US) and she began trying to talk to me and asked where I’m from, after I told her I’m from Brazil she looked very confused and said “but you don’t look Mexican”. It took me a second to process what she meant and tbh it was kinda funny and at that moment I just wanted to grab my order and go so I just said “yeah I’m adopted”. That only made her ask more questions about where my birth parents were originally from because “I look white”, I didn’t wanna keep talking to her so I said I didn’t know and that I had to go. 

When I was about to leave I see my parents coming inside the shop to ask me if I wanted to do some exploring on my own while they take my cousins to the park. They were talking to me in portuguese, and the woman looked at us and came closer again to ask if these were my parents, I said yes but that we were leaving already and that it was nice talking to her and blah blah blah but she again had that confused look on her face and said “your parents don’t look Mexican either”, then she apologized to them and explained “your daughter was telling me about her adoption” and I see my parents looking at me also very confused and they asked me in portuguese why did I say that I was mexican and adopted. I couldnt help but laugh because im sorry, it was funny, but before I could say anything my parents were already mad and they tried to tell the woman with their broken English that I was not adopted and that we were not Mexican but from Brazil, anyways the woman actually got offended and said it’s racist to lie about my race (as if brazilian or mexican was a race lol) and that I shouldn’t lie about being adopted, she told me being an attention seeker was not going to take me anywhere and that was basically it. My parents were not happy at all and they kept saying I embarrassed them and they think I said that because I’m ashamed of them and ashamed of who I am. I tried to explain but they dont wanna listen. They said next time they fly to the US they’re not taking me. So AITA for telling a random woman that im adopted when im not?

Keeping this vague for obvious reasons, I am only asking this because my wife thinks I am in the wrong here.

Part 1 (2008)When I was in high school I was bullied relentlessly by the white kids, they would come up with cruel names for me and make my life hell. This woman in the story at the story (Casey) was dating the guy who was the worst of the bullies he would make my life hell he was extremely racist and homophobic he compared Black and Indian people to monkeys and Jews to rats and said gay people are mentally ill. Furthermore he used to sell drugs. One time in 12th grade Chemistry class he and his idiot friends caused a mess and told the teacher that I did it and I asked Casey to tell the truth that her BF did it and it was not me, she lied and said it was me. The teacher spent the entire class chewing me out much to the delight of Casey's BF and his friends. (This is one incident out of many, I am gonna keep it concise)

Part 2 (3 days ago)

I work in a firm in a senior position, and we had shortlisted 3 potential candidates (one of them) for a position below me in the firm. It was up to me to interview them other two as 8/10 and Casey a 9.5 when it came to being a fit for our company. I chose one of the other guys the guys as my recommendation and I told my boss (when he asked) that the stuff Casey's xbf said SHE said and that she was racist, bigoted and used to deal drugs. Several of our clients are POC's, Jews and or gay. He trusted me and agreed with me and we agreed on my choice to not hire Casey.

I do not want to work with Casey, end of discussion and if I have to twist the truth, so be it, however when I told my wife, she said I was wrong and I should not lie and mislead like that, I respect her opinion and since I can't exactly ask other people. I thought I'd post here.

I (F15) have a friend group that's really chaotic. They do whatever they want, whenever they want and Im just there, seemingly and somehow dragged to everything they do.

Recently, a big fight happened in our group chat where everyone was involved and I was just quiet throughout it. I keep to myself, and it wasn't my battle to be in or to include myself in. This caused fights happening at school, whenever we hangout and more people getting involved when they dont need too and again, im just there watching it all. 

But today, during our hang out at the mall the arguments continued and I had enough of it and shouted back for everyone to just shut up and that the 2 fighting should just figure out their situations  instead of adding more and more people into it. I was sick of the fighting, and my phone blowing up like crazy about ""who's side are you on?"" ""did you hear about this"" ""did you hear about that?"" But the  arguments continued and I asked my mom to pick me up only and I went home and left out the group chat. 

10 minutes later, they all are just calling back and forth, some texting me to come back and the 1/2 of the people fighting texted me to stop trying to be the center of attention and I should've ""expressed my feelings earlier"" I just hung up and blocked a good half of the friend group, but the other half I didn't block are call me an AH.

AITA?

I got invited to a wedding in July for someone I haven’t seen or spoken to in 4 years and said yes (went to school together - was wondering why I was invited tbh but figured why not as I could visit my parents at the same time).

First off, there is no such thing as an ex-alcoholic. She’s still an alcoholic, she just isn’t drinking anymore.  That’s recovery. Think of it like diabetes- you can be diabetic and have control over your blood sugars, but you’re still a diabetic. It never goes away, but it does become easier. 

And as an alcoholic in recovery, she is the only person that can manage her recovery. If you were serving candy to your guests and one person is diabetic, they wouldn’t eat the candy.

I (F26) had a lot of good changes in my life recently. I finally got got my degree, I got engaged and I was able to receive a credit for an apartment. My mum suggested to throw a party for family and friends to celebrate these events and I happily agreed, being sure it would be only for closest family and my friends. I spent lots of time in the kitchen but I like cooking so it wasn't really a big deal. My friends, brother and dad's siblings arrived, we started chatting and generally had a good time. Then my parents arrived and I found out my mom brought her cousin, Alexis (F 40-something) with her. 

Mum and Alexis were very close as kind and young adults, basically raised together. However, since they grew up they weren't too close and as a result aunt Alexis was almost a stranger for me (so I figured my mum will not bring her at my party). Also, Alexis had an alcohol problem for some time (along with some other problems), though she attended therapy and was sober for few years at the time of the party. I was aware of Alexis past but I was sure since my mum bring her, she knew what she was doing. Also, at the time when they arrived there was already an open bottle of the wine at the table. 

So, basically I greet them and the party continued. However, when I started pouring wine (for Alexis an non-alcohol soda) my aunt started to pout (I'm not sure if it is the word but it looked like that) and shortly after left. I was not thinking too much about that at the time, especially since as I said I am not too close with her. 

But the next day my mum called me cruel and unconsidering for filling glasses with wine in front of my ex-alcoholic aunt. Apparently Alexis got mad and told my mum I should be ashamed of myself. I told my mum that I wasn't even aware she is going to be there and anyway I wouldn't accomodate only to Alexis needs given there were like 10 other people at the party. Mum however says I should hide the alcohol right when a person with a problem entered the room. 

I think I am not at fault here but I sort of have a guilty conscience. I may not be close with Alexis but I do not want her to start drinking again, too. AITA?

Tldr: forgot to tell gf about spur of the moment plans, she got upset at me 

So I’m struggling to see how I’m in the wrong here. Some background: Me (22M) and my GF “M” (21f) have been together for 3.5 years. We are both seniors in college, basically neighbors (we live in apartments 1 minute away from each other), and planning on moving in together next year. 

The issue: on Friday M worked from 9-2, I didn’t have anything to do except a quick homework assignment. So I’m on the couch hanging out with my roommate (D) when my neighbor (N) and another of our friends (S) who lives ~5-10 minutes away walk in (D had forgot to tell me he invited them). That was around 1PM or so. At 1:30 someone said something about maybe going to S house but nothing more was said until probably 1:50 when S got up and said he was gonna go home and asked if everyone was coming. We all said yes, S left in his own car and everyone else started getting shoes and stuff on to go with me in my car. At 2:10 M calls and asks me what I’m doing, I said about to go to S house. When I said that she hung up on me mid sentence (she does this when someone says something that upsets her) then texts me saying I never tell her what I’m doing which is not true, last time me and friends went out I told her beforehand to double check that we didn’t have any plans (I am a forgetful person and have forgotten to say things like this in the past tho, however I have no problem with her knowing what I’m up to at any time if I forget to say and she asks). 

So I text her back and tell her I just told you what I’m doing, it’s not like this was my plans for today all along I had literally just decided to go 15 minutes before you called me. 

Basically she blows up on me that the fact I just now decided to go isn’t the point, I don’t care about her, and I never tell her things. 

I responded by saying why does it matter, why do you need to know everywhere I go, it’s not like we had plans to go do something today that I blew off, and we we hadn’t even talked that day since she left for work that morning. 

At this point we’ve arrived at S house and she starts calling me. The first time she called me I picked up and she just started yelling at me so I hung up, that happened Once more before I started just ignoring her calls. I said I’m at a friends house I’m not gonna sit on the phone and be yelled at and she said fuck you we’re done then. I said you’re being ridiculous but whatever have fun with that and it’s the next morning and we haven’t talked since. 

I think I could potentially be the asshole here bc I don’t think it’s unreasonable to always be letting each other know what we’re doing and I did forget to let her know, but I also think her reaction was completely uncalled for and she’s making a huge deal out of something that isn’t really that big of a deal. But AITA for not telling my Gf that I was going to a friends house?

I'm in a long term, committed relationship, we live together; we tell each other pretty much everything we're doing, but....not 100% predictably, all the time. We'll catch up at the end of the day, certainly. The only time we stop to call or text each other that our plans have changed is is we have the time to do so, or if changing the plans affects plans we already had, or if it'll make us late home. Otherwise it's just minutiae that isn't necessary.

Requiring the other partner to update you for every possible thing is not asking for healthy communication, it's just controlling and micromanaging.

Apologizing for formatting, On mobile.


This took place last night while I was out with my boyfriend and his kids (6) & (4) for dinner at a restaurant. Now to give some context, My boyfriend is a single dad with 2 kids, the 6yo is an angel but the 4yo is constantly hyperactive and tends to do things that cause issues for kids and adults, My boyfriend never tries to decsicpline him or give out punishments (age propriate of course) resulting in his behavior getting worse. As the girlfriend, I'm obviously not allowed to intervene or have a say in how he raises his kids, as he says.


Anyways, so last night while we were sitting eating, my boyfriend's 4yo son kept moving in his seat and making a fuss, throwing forks/napkins on the floor than telling me to pick them up. I did this several times but got fed up and told him to please stop and eat his food since my boyfriend was staring at his phone the entire time. The 4yo got agitated and unexpectedly spit in my dish before I could begin to eat. I was flabbergasted, My boyfriend saw this and scolded his son into sitting down quietly. I was disgusted I pushed the dish away and was about to call for the waitress to cone take it but my boyfriend stopped me and asked what I was doing, I told him his kid just spit in my dish and I was going to replace it but he said I didn't need to and should just remove the portion where his son spat and eat the rest, I was beyond shocked and grossed out, I said no way I was going to eat from that dish and my boyfriend said there was no way he was going to pay for a replacement dish and *urged* me to just eat from this one. I said no and we started arguing. I said it was disrespectful and unhygenic to expect me to eat from that dish amd he accused me of messing up his budget for the week. I took my purse and went to the restroom. He started texting me saying that the kids noticed my attitude and that I'd better keep it together but I turned my phone off and walked out.

He followed me outside and the argument continued, He said I was overreacting and causing an issue for no reason at all, but I said he was basically pushing me to eat from a dish his kid spat in which wasn't okay or acceptable. He still said I overreacted and insisted I go back inside but I refused and went back to the apt. he came back with the kids later and picked an argument with me about ruining our time together as a family and making the kids feel uncomfortable. He also said that if I wanted a replacement dish then I should pay for it and guilted me for expecting him to pay even though his kid spat in it. I said that his behavior made me feel disrespected but he said I overreactec and should've let it go instead.

He's been cold shouldering me still, and I'm.unsure of wether I really overreacted to what happened.

So to start this off I want to say I love my wife but over the past year it's been extremely hard to get my own space and feel like I'm respected in our relationship.
We literally do everything together whatever hobby I take up she's suddenly interested in it and I can't go do it without her.
Every TV show I try to watch I can't watch unless she's there too.
When I try to walk out of a room to go get something I have to give her a hug/kiss otherwise she'll block the door, even when I go to the bathroom she comes in without warning to show me something or tell me something, I feel like I'm just stuck and don't have any freedom at all not to mention that she constantly grabs my crotch even tho I've asked her numerous time to not do it, I don't find it attractive and it just makes me feel bad about myself like I'm there for her use and nothing else.
So today out of frustration I bought a lock for the bathroom door to take back some privacy I know it's only 5 minutes each time but it's something to help me feel at ease that I have a boundary where she can't come into.
Since I bought it she hasn't been talking to me much and just said it was stupid to have one cause we don't need it but wouldn't listen to my reason for it.
So AITA for trying to set boundaries and personal space in my marriage?

So i (15f) and my family (mom, dad, brother Andy grandpa) moved into this nice neighbourhood about 3 years ago, we thought that this would be a good neighbourhood for us 

until we got to summer, when it started to get warmer this lady behind our house started to drink, she is a 69 yr old lady

during summer she will drink which is fine but the problem with that is she screams at  to shut off my parents bathroom light while my parents go to the bathroom

she has shown up at our door and started banging at the door at 11pm over 20 times she has threatened to call cps on me and my brother (11m) over 10 times she has tried to break in to our house over 5 times

She has also tried to kidnap me since we have moved here

The second to last incident she was screaming at my mom (39f) to shut out the light as she was going to the bathroom she threatened to call cps and the police. 

Thankfully i got her yelling on recording as we started to record her to show to the police as their is already a file number for her as we are not the first people that have encountered this 

The next day i was taking my dog for a walk around our neighbourhood when i passed her house she made small talk with me so i did as well than i started to ignore her as i kept walking she kept giving me nasty looks as i walked passed her house so i started to get upset

I kept saying how it wasn’t right for her to threaten cps on my brother and me for my mom going to the bathroom, she said that I’m to young to talk to her about it and that i shouldn’t be talking to her about that and that she had never said such a thing so i told her i had recording and went off on her she got embarrassed and went back into her house. And now I’ve been thinking about it and i feel like the asshole

I’m genuinely torn about what to do. 

My (17) friend (16) is a reckless driver. She averages about 100mph, give or take. She’s told me before she does it because she likes the “rush” it gives her. I’ve told her that she’s putting other people at risk. She constantly assures me she only does it when “no one is around,” but, at that speed, it’s hard to be fully aware of your surroundings. 

I’m worried she’ll hurt herself, or, worse, injure someone else. So far she hasn’t, and she (miraculously) has never been pulled over. But honestly I hope she does get pulled over, because I think it’s the wake up call she needs. 

It just shocks me how little empathy or compassion she seems to have for other people on the road. Also, she is usually. Inebriated. when she drives. One of our mutual friends constantly enables her and laughs like it’s funny. 

I want to tell her moms, but one is struggling with a life-threatening illness, so the other is constantly taking care of her. I’m pretty sure this is one of the biggest reason my friend is so reckless, but still. It makes it difficult to tell them and honestly I don’t know what they would even do about it. 

I want to contact law enforcement (non-emergency of course), but I’m not sure if that’s too far. I don’t want to overstep, but I also know that if she injures herself or others I’ll regret not doing anything. Also, I don’t know what would happen if I do report her. I know her family can’t afford to pay a fine right now, and I don’t want her to go to jail or anything, but when I tell her my concerns she just ignores them and tries to convince me im overreacting. 

WBITA if I report her? Is there some other alternative I can turn to first?

I (56M) have been in couple with Jane (55F) for around 2.5 years.

For more info I am the owner of a big house (3bd, big kitchen, garden…) and Jane has a 2bd flat.

2 years ago my daughter Lila (21F) came back from the country she moved to with her mom when she and I separated. She was around 6 at the time. She lived with me for 6 months and when her BF (22M) rejoigned her they took a flat. He is not fluent in our language so finding a job was a little hard. They managed but I still decided to help them every month.

Jane has two kids, Kara (28F) and Tom (30M).

Kara is married and has two kids, she and her husband own a house. Tom is working on his PHD.

Around 4 months ago me and Jane decided to move together. We decided to rent a house. We wanted to have something new together and to have a clean start.

In the meantime because of the pandemic my daughter lost her job and 2 months ago she realised she was pregnant. 

Jane and I found a house to rent and we started the move two weeks ago. Jane put her flat to rent and after some thinking I decided to lend the house to my daugther. She and her BF live in a 1bd flat.

I don’t need the rent money and I give every month money to her. 

In this country she knows only me and my dad. She wasn’t able to go back to see her mother because of travel restriction. She is now young, without a job and pregnant. Her BF is working but he is also young and they are both scared and a little lost. So letting them stay in my now empty house seemed like an easy solution for me. They would have room for the baby, they don’t have to worry about rent and they will be able to save for the future. 

I am also proud and happy to help her and to see her trust me even if I didn’t see her a lot when she was growing up.

Now the issue is Jane. 

When I told her what I was planning to do with the house she got a little angry. She said she doesn’t understand why I took the decision alone. In her opinion i should have talked with her about it and we should have chosen together who to lend the house to. 

I got defensive and told her that it was my house so my choice. It aggraved things and she accused me of chosing my daugther over her kids. She thinks her daughter with 2 kids deserves my house more because theirs doesn’t have a garden and is smaller. She says my daughter dosen’t need something this big.

Honestly I don’t think I am in the wrong here, but some member of her family called me and said I was playing favoritism between the children.

One of my friends also told me i should have talked to my GF before taking a decision about my house. That couple needed to take decision together.

Apologies for formatting, I am on mobile. 
     Background: I (f29) live with my fiancée (m28), and his parents (f70ish) and (m57?). My FIL loves to cook and I am incredibly grateful for that, especially since we just had a baby. There have been points of contention about hygiene around the baby especially since FIL chews on his hands and has some open sores around his fingernails. 
     Last night FIL was making some pasta with red sauce and sausage. As we were grabbing our plates I noticed FIL using his bare hands to mix butter into the pasta and had a loud reaction to that. I said “Oh my god!” He was like “What?” And I said I just didn’t expect him to use his bare hands to mix the pasta. He said “Well I just had my hands in boiling water and the pasta needs to be mixed.” I had the heebie jeebies thinking about FIL’s dead skin flakes and blood all up in the pasta but I ate it anyways… I know it’s not going to kill me. It’s just gross to think about. 
     Like I said, I am incredibly grateful for the food, but WIBTA if I asked him to use utensils? Especially on ready to eat food?

I (23m) am marrying my fiancée (22f) in August of this year, and we recently sent out the invitations. To save some money on the invites, we used a website instead of the traditional paper invites, where you set up a page, and then send a link to the page to people. They can then search their name and tick if they are coming or not. 
I should also say, this is only for the wedding party. The ceremony is happening a week before the party, about 200 miles from home, just the two of us. We made this decision partly because we haven't got lots of money to spend on a wedding, and also because we knew there would be family drama over who sits where and does what in all of the wedding.
Most of my mums side of the family (but mainly my mum and sister) had a big falling out with my step sister, which resulted in my step sister having very little to do with my family, other than occasionally seeing her dad (my stepdad). I don't know all the details of the falling out, but from what I do know, it seemed quite petty, from both sides. It also didn't involve me, so I stayed out of it. Me and my fiancée decided to invite my step sister to the wedding party, since we haven't fallen out with her, and it didn't seem right to not send her an invite. I knew this wouldn't be what my family wanted but as it was our wedding, we decided to invite her anyway.
Due to the nature of the invites, you can see who else has been invited by searching their name and seeing if it comes up. I don't know who (I suspect my sister) but someone has searched my step sisters name and seen she has been invited. Both my mum and stepdad called and texted me over the next couple of days, trying to get me to not send the link to my stepsister as I hadnt sent it to her at this point. My mum said she doesn't want her there and thought it had nothing to do with my fiancée if my stepsister is invited or not, and my stepdad said we're not all a happy family, they don't want her there, and I am upsetting my mum, who already has a lot on her plate (my maternal grandad is currently in hospital having had an emergency operation to remove his large intestine, and my younger brother is in the middle of a mental health crisis. He also said if we invite her he will tell her she can't be there. There was some back and forth, and we decided to send the invite anyway. both mum and stepdad messaged and said they were disappointed in me and when did I stop being considerate. That they've sacrificed a lot to give me the best they could and to think about that. Brother and grandad were brought up again also. Stepdad said the situation is sorted now, and wanted me to reach out to my mum and basically apologise. We decided to wait a few hours before replying this time, so we could calm down a bit. We came to the decision that at this point in time, we don't want them at the wedding if this is their attitude towards us, and I told them this in the next text in which we explained why we are pissed off

I know the title might sound bad, but hear me out.

I (14F) have always been worried about how I smell. Due to a medical condition, I have to shower every day and I'm always worried that I'll smell bad because of my condition, but nothing I've tried helps. I've made it known to my family members that I was always worried about that.

Today, I got out of the car and immediately smelled something burning, which isn't common right now since grass fires are everywhere. I said ""it smells"" to which my sister (24F) said ""so do you"" She started apologizing and saying it was a joke, but this wasn't the first time she's made this ""joke"" either. She always points out my medical condition and uses it against me, she humiliates me publicly and harasses me about it. We've been out in public before and she said ""At least I don't (what my condition is) unlike some"" and pointed her head straight at me.

I jumped out of the car and said ""go to hell, go burn in fucking hell"" to which my sister replied with ""that's a little overdramatic"" I refuse to speak to her now.

I'm so sorry you lost your dad. Mine died when I was your age, too. Your mom should be ashamed of herself for not stopping your sister's bullying by threatening to kick her out if she doesn't stop. Ffs. Bullying a child at 24, how sad for her to be so emotionally stunted and mean-spirited.

I also promise you that people don't notice smell as much as you worry they might. Also... anyone who says anything in public or unkindly is ***rude***. That is the sort of thing people should politely ignore, because you never know the reason- they may be unable to help it and have a medical reason, and are already hyperaware, as you are.

Definitely try Lume, and use it like an all-over body lotion if it works!

I take a medication that causes excessive sweating. Plus I live in Florida. Luckily it's only sweating and doesn't really smell if I wear deodorant under my arms, but I hate it. My makeup slicks off even on cooler days. The only tip I have if you also sweat a bit more than you'd like, to try Benedry- diphenhydramine. It basically kinda dries me out just a little bit so I don't sweat as much. Don't take enough to be drowsy! Just start with a third or half of one pill and go up a little after a few days until you can take half or one pill with zero drowsiness after a week or two. It helps me a lot, though I only take a half dose to lessen my sweating, and only a few times a week.

If you feel drowsy, you took more than you need to slow excessive sweating.

Just make sure to buy the off-brand diphenhydramine so it's cheaper, and get it in 100-count bottles at Walmart for $5. Lots of folks take it daily for allergies, so if it helps, don't be afraid to take it once a day a few times a week if it makes a difference.

for some context, I work as a daycare teacher part time and where I live, the ratio is 1 educator to 8 preschoolers.

This past Thursday, I had just gotten to work and it was around 3:45 pm. I was on one side of the yard, guarding a bridge that lead to the other side of the yard, where two of our children were testing boundaries.

I was called over by my coworker, and she told me that one of the children told her that she wasn't feeling well. I looked at the child, and she was very pale, crying, and overall looked sick to her stomach. I thought she was going to be sick, so I turned around to count how many children there were to see how many children I needed to take with me, when my coworker told me we had 11, so I only needed to take 3. I grabbed the closest two, and took the three of them inside. As I opened the door, a parent arrived for pickup.

While I was waiting for the child as she used the rest room , my supervisor asked how many kids I had and I told her three. She then ran back outside and told my coworker to count again. I didn't think much of it because ratio was constantly broke at my other job, and it was never a big deal. My supervisor came in the room a minute or so later and told me that we broke ratio and I needed to count next time.

I explained to her how my coworker told me I only needed to take three, and my main concern was the possibly sick child. She told me that ratio's were more important than a child getting sick, and then left.

Later that night, I was walking back from the front door after bringing a child to their parents and she was talking to my coworker about it. She said that she contacted our bosses and explained what happened from her perspective only, and they told her it wasn't that big of a deal, and it wasn't a serious occurrence. I re-explained what happened from my perspective, and that I didn't want to create a biohazard on the yard, especially when we had an Autistic child in our care that would definitely play in it (they'd done it before), and I was told I should have let the child get sick on her self and in front of everyone else because, once again, ratio's are more important than a sick child.

The next day, however, I came in around 1 to cover lunch breaks because we were short staffed. When the coworker I worked with the day before came back from her break, she told me that the supervisor had gone around gossiping about what happened to everyone else. Thankfully, everyone was on our side, but it still hurt.

Later that night, we were closing the centre together again, we were talking about how unfair it was, and my coworker told me that she had brought up concerns about the two children pushing boundaries and she brushed it off and said that she cared more about ratios than out of control children. Since she's told me that, I've considered emailing our bosses with our sides of the story and reporting her.

So, would I be the AH for reporting her?

t7cy4o,hzgurpb,t3_t7cy4o,"NTA. I have a spinal fusion and am pretty disabled from it. I’m a woman, but still there are things that I traditionally took care of that I can’t do anymore and I can’t expect my husband to do everything alone. Either I ask for help together or I pay someone or I just flat out don’t do some things or scale them back.

For example I was always into planting flowers & such. My husband can’t take on all that I used to do in addition to his normal job / chores. We coordinate some things to do together, but it’s also scaled back. Some things I hire someone to do, but that gets pricy. Some things I change, like rather than plant everything in the ground I use pots and raised planters that are easier on my back.

One of the hardest things I’ve found, personally, is learning to let go of the idea that you will somehow be able to maintain life as it once was pre-injury. Something is going to have to slide, change or compromise. You have to prioritize what you really want to do and what things you want to let go. Things like planting plants and hauling heavy equipment - do you want to go for simpler landscaping? Do you want to hire someone?

The other thing is you are a 112 pound woman with a career as a nurse and a two year old. Where will your family be if YOU HURT YOUR BACK because you are trying to lift something so heavy?

I am sure he feels awful and as I’m sure you know back pain doesn’t always make for a cheerful, sweet disposition. I would pick a low key time when he’s not in as much pain and try and discuss how your lives have changed, reasonable expectations and what would happen if you got hurt. Prioritize what must be done, what can be modified and what can be hired out. And while you’re at it work on setting those limits about how he can / can’t talk to you. 

Also, idk if you have the NextDoor app in your community but I can tell you that there are ALWAYS high school and college boys in my area wanting to come do work like what you’ve described.

Aita My husband has a herniated disc, we’ve been dealing with this for a while and I’ve taken on more physical aspects of his business when needed (construction business). I’m also a part time nurse and we have a two year old. He bought new shrubs for our home and I was under the impression we both would install them (me doing more lifting etc) but he blew up when I told him the wheel barrow we were going to use was full of heavy debris I couldn’t lift and move it myself. He then yells I’m just tired of you not doing things yourself, I don’t want to micro manage you anymore, I don’t want anything to do with these shrubs and if my back was fine I would do it myself without you. AITA for feeling this was unwarranted ? I understand his back situation, trust me, I try to be accommodating but I just wanted help such as hey maybe move the shrub over a bit, or let’s cut the net this much etc . Idk I feel like I just can’t do anything right …. I’m literally a woman who weighs 112 pounds, I am not physically strong and I feel like he wants to to have the strength of a man.

I grew up in South Africa and moved here when I was a kid. 
My accent is not really that noticeable unless I make it. I guess I am a true African American and my skin tone is dark. 

I work in a restaurant and this old man got mad that I didn’t call him sir. I asked him if he was a knight because I’m not calling him that. He in insisted that I called him sir or get another server. I said oh are you a knight of the KKK then after he was getting extra shitty about respect towards your elders. We got on a screaming match and my manager didn’t kick him out. I went to the owner of the restaurant and the owner fired the manager for allowing a customer to act like that and saying that the manager was excusing racist in the restaurant. We have been repeatedly not to server these people and call the police if necessary (times have changed and I guess some people don’t get that)  My manager lost her job because she just reassigned the table. She and I got in a fight because she’s been working at the restaurant before I was even in the country and now she doesn’t have a reference. She’s saying I overreacted and 10 years ago I couldn’t expect to treat customers like that. I’m not calling anyone sir or being forced to. I’m sorry I think it dehumanizing from my experience. It’s either rooted in the classism of her Majesties empire or in the racism of the south for me.

Here's a small tangent -- I had a very similar situation when I was younger. I am female, and I was shopping for clothes with my mother. I got mad because there were no good orange shirts in the girls' section (my favorite color is orange, all of what I saw was closer to pink), and then I got mad because there were no video game or Marvel shirts. No, not even the ""girly superhero"" kind. I then almost started crying because I needed shorts and the only shorts were booty shorts (yes, they were marked as ""for kids""), and they made me extremely uncomfortable.

My mom, who hates pink and frilly things, understood my plight and brought me to the boys' section. I rejoiced at all of the clothes that both fit my aesthetic and made me feel comfortable in my own skin. This was when I was roughly in second grade; I have been wearing masculine and androgynous clothing ever since, and I only ever wear jeans instead of leggings or skirts.

What you did for your niece is incredible. She clearly likes masculine clothing better for her own personal reasons, and she was visibly upset by the suggestion of returning what you bought. You gave her an opportunity to experiment with her style, and she was able to make a decision for herself.

My Brother and SIL are struggling a little for money currently as he recently got laid off and my 10 year old niece hit a growth spurt at the worst possible moment so she is in need of a bunch of new clothes, I offered to take her shopping in a fun Auntie and Niece bonding time to get her some new clothes. They agreed to this and I took her out.

When we got to the shops she did not like any of the pink, frilly, glittery or ""Girly"" things and when she spotted a minecraft t-shirt in the boys section she rushed towards it and asked me if she could get it, I told her sure and began to look for more clothes with her, n the end she picked about 90% of her clothes from the boys section a variety of jeans, t-shirts, and a hoodie. I also got her a pair of trainers (sneakers for you Americans), a nice dress blouse and some black dress trousers with dress shoes. Afterwords we got some McDonalds and I took her home. All in all, a good day.

When  we got her home we began to show my Brother and SIL the clothes she picked out and my SIL got upset with me asking why i'd bought her only ""Boys"" clothes, I told her it was what she liked and picked out, she said I should have gotten her at least some ""Nice"" clothes and pretty things, at least a dress for nicer times and I showed her the blouse and trousers I got for that reason but that didn't soothe her at all. My brother suggested we take some of it back and get some  prettier things and my niece was clearly upset by this.

I asked them what the big deal was, she's a kid what does it matter if he's running about in jeans and t-shirts? but my SIL insists that my niece should have pretty clothes. 

My brother has told me in private my SIL is just upset as they can't afford to get her the stuff she'd normally pick out and she's lashing out and to not take it to heart but I told him that his daughter picked out the clothes and she's old enough to know if she doesn't like pretty ""Girly"" things. 

Am I the asshole in this scenario? I tried to do a good deed but it ended up blowing up in my face.

I don't think your brother is TA much cause he doesn't seem to care much about the clothes, but he's backing up his wife anyway and not standing up for his kid which does make him a little AH.

Your money, her choice. Clothes have no gender. 

""Boys"" clothes also solve a lot of problems...need plain black or white socks? Boys section.  The kids have wide feet? Boys shoes run wider than the girls shoes do. For some reason, the boys section also has better winter hats and gloves than the girls section (which seems to prioritize style over not getting frostbite.) 

The boys section also seems to get more variety. There are tons of different licensed t-shirts and such in the boys section, but the girls section usually only has disney and Nickelodeon shirts

Until this past week, I'd never seen a ""girls"" pokemon shirt in stores, even though both my nieces love it. But in the boys section, the variety is astonishing. Minecraft, fortnight, star wars, pokemon, Mario, Jurassic park, punny shirts, even nasa shirts!

Also, can we talk about practicality? The boys shirts always seem to be thicker and more durable than the girls shirts. The boys shorts are always longer too. The basics are usually cheaper in the boys section. There are more pockets in the boys section, and longer shorts.  
(I'm not saying shorts are bad, I'm just saying I don't like  paying *more* for shorts in the girls section, but getting half the amount of shorts!)

I buy my nieces whatever the hell they like, and whatever the hell they need.

One niece loves space, unicorns, and rainbows. And wouldn't you know it, Walmart has rainbow unicorn astronaut leggings! (Not kidding, they did!)

The other niece's favorite colors are blaze orange and camouflage green. She likes dinosaurs, camouflage, and pockets.  They don't have those options in a lot of girls clothes. So, she got boys pants, tons of cool dinosaur shirts (also from the boys section.) Also, found her a pair of bright orange cargo pants....in the boys section.

Her favorite cartoon is Mickey mouse, and you can't even get Mickey mouse in the girls section at most places. It's all minnie mouse (who is decidedly *not* her favorite.) So, even her disney merch is ""boys"". 

The only reason I stopped buying my niece's boys pants is because apparently even at age 7, they start with lower crotches in boys pants, and they chafe on my nieces

You are trying to get back at him because he is upsetting you by showing a complete lack of care when you bring up this concern with him and it is reaching a breaking point for you where you feel like he needs to learn a lesson NOW as you can no longer tolerate it.

I would recommend instead that you tell him directly: if you keep leaving me behind, I won't look for you, I'm going to get a taxi home or call a friend to take me home. There is literally no point in walking with you if you're just going to wander off without me and I have already told you several times this bothers me and you haven't stopped doing it.

It is key to then follow through and if he gets upset about it, you can give him a reminder that you gave him opportunities to address this before and he chose not to. If he isn't actually going to be with you during these things, then you'll just stay at home or go home. It doesn't sound to me like he even turns back to look for you or goes off to get some stuff and comes back to you.

It would also be fair of you to consider whether this is a dealbreaker for you and if you want to give him more chances to address it and how many more (1 if he outright acts the exact same or 2 if he shows progress etc.).

I posted this previously a few days ago but I think I did it incorrectly my apologies this is my first time posting here.

Throw away because my boyfriend uses Reddit. I (25f) have mobility issues, while I don’t think that makes me too much slower of a walker (when walking with friends I keep up fine or at least my friends easily match my pace without making it noticeable) I am also very short with short legs so maybe I do walk slower than my very tall boyfriend (m29).

The past couple years he’s always been bad at leaving me behind but as my mobility issues worsen it’s gotten worse. He is incredibly supportive with my mobility issues but for some reason he keeps doing this. When walking together my boyfriend always out paces me and leaves me behind. Whether it’s while we are grocery shopping, out at the mall, down town at night, in a parking garage etc. It’s gotten to the point where it happens everywhere we go.

Every time we go out together he will end up at the end of the aisle while I’m still in the middle or start of the aisle. I will call his name ( and even sometimes call his phone to no answer because he just straight up wandered off) and he just keeps going. When I find him I remind him to be please remember that I have mobility issues and I have shorter legs so to please try to slow down or at least not leave me behind.

Despite me asking he will do it again every time. While it’s not a huge issue, I am an adult I can fend for myself in a grocery store, it hurts to get left behind when we were supposed to be doing something together. This has also happened in a variety of places I would rather not be alone (major city at night time etc.).

The past couple of times I’ve started thinking about just ditching him temporarily (ie calling a taxi or a friend to take me home, or going to a completely different part of the store) so he knows how it feels or maybe even gets a bit worried. Would I be the asshole if the next time my boyfriend leaves me behind, I ditch him?

Reason I might be the asshole: I might scare him or this might be seen as a potentially childish response to the issue.

We are currently staying with MIL. I know she is doing us a favor, but I was raised in a family where people genuinely wanted to help each other and I'm still taken aback by how transitional my husband's family is. 

MIL is engaged and she is soooo clingy it's insane. I honestly don't know how this guy deals with her. She sometimes wakes him up multiple times at night for attention. I've heard him talk to her about how that needs to stop. MIL always laughs it off. Last night MIL screamed and it wore up my kids. It really freaked out the toddler and it took forever to get the baby back to sleep.

In the morning when my husband asked if she was ok MIL said she was fine, he was just tickling her. I was immediately annoyed. Her fiancé said he has asked her not to wake him so many times, so payback. I pointed out that they woke my kids and they both shrugged it off. I kind of jokingly asked if MIL was going to keep waking him up. She said no but everyone else rolled their eyes, because really she probably will until she realizes he is serious. She doesn't do boundaries well.

I said nicely that I get they are playing around, but I have two little kids and her screaming did wake them and I was up a good part of the night. MIL said that it was his fault. Then said she felt bad but really it is her house and she can make noise whenever she wants to. I said that while I understand that it seems weird that she wouldn't care more about her grandkids sleeping than her right to scream.

MIL snapped at me that they aren't her kids and I'm trying to make her feel bad when she didn't do anything wrong. I said she was technically right and she owes us nothing and doesn't have to care about anyone, but maybe that is why she is afraid of being alone (she has never said she is afraid of it but holy hell is she clingy with this man) is because she knows she doesn't deserve love, if this is how she treats her own family.

She currently isn't talking to me and her fiance has said that he thinks I am a huge asshole.

Sorry for this being gross! Throwaway because I’m embarrassed LOL.

Background: I (27F) have a childhood friend “Jane” (28F) who has very little storage space at her apartment. My wife (29F) and I let Jane store stuff in our house since we have plenty of room. She has a key to access the house if she needs to fetch any of her things when we’re not home. 

My wife and I were fooling around on one of our tables two days ago, and she was nude. Jane, coming to pick up one of her things, walked in and saw. She had texted ahead to let us know, but I missed the notification 🤦🏻‍♀️ Jane was very embarrassed and just started apologizing profusely and sprinted out with her package. I called Jane later to apologize and thought the situation was just embarrassing but kinda funny. 

Then Jane responded that she thought it was really gross that we did that on furniture other than our bed. She said it was “disrespectful,” because guests should be able to use furniture in people’s homes without “having to think about the host’s naked body on it.” 

I was caught off guard because I thought that being naked or having sex around the house was… normal? It’s something my wife and I do basically everywhere, and I always thought that it was fine as long as care was taken to clean up (we always do, thoroughly). I said so to Jane and we ended up having an argument about it. She said some things about me “getting p***y all over the Scrabble table” and I got really upset called her a prude and a douchebag, and said something dumb about putting p***y on whichever damn table I want. I hung up on her and we’re taking a break from talking to cool down.

I’m starting to feel really guilty and like I need to apologize about snapping at Jane and for “getting p***y on the Scrabble table” in the first place, but my wife thinks Jane is being a dick and that we’re allowed to do whatever we want with our own furniture. I’m too mortified to ask anyone I know in case this is actually a gross, disrespectful thing and they’ll all be upset that they’ve touched my icky sex furniture, LOL. Reddit, AITA?

My sister asked me to help her go get her car from the shop. After picking it up she asked if she could drive my car since her car didn't have gas and she had a lesson with her personal trainer I said yes bur failed to notice her car didn't have keys to the house until after she had rushed out. I called her asking her to come let me in but she said I had to wait until after her appointment and groceries since she was already there (a 45 minute drive from the house) I told her it was ridiculous to make me wait 3 hours on my day off but she basically told me I was being selfish. By the time she let me in 3 and a half hours had passed and I haven't talked to her since. My parents tell me I'm being dramatic but I view it as her fault I was outside in the first place since I was doing  her a favor. It's also important that I didn't have my wallet on me since we left in such a rush so I could just go get a coffee or something. So reddit AITA?

My mother in law is constantly criticizing me, my family, and my friends. I try and bear it because I love my husband, but recently my daughter called my crying after an afternoon at her grandmother's house because she was having a gossip session on the phone within earshot of my young daughter. 

She made homophobic comments towards me (despite the fact that I'm married to her son, a man) as well as making disparaging, slut-shaming remarks towards my best friend / my daughter's ""aunt"" about her and her husband expecting their sixth child. 

I picked her up, explained to her that it's never okay to say things like that about anyone's sexuality, and that babies are a happy occasion. 

I told my husband I no longer want my daughter to be around his mother, even with supervision after this incident. He thinks she can change. This has become a huge fight between us, but I've put my foot down and said I will not allow her in the house nor will I allow our daughter to go over there.

We've been dating for 1year and last week I met his
parents for the first time at their home (he still lives with
them) and I went there one more time this week. 
My bf cares very much about his parents
opinions, especially when it comes to his
moms.
Before meeting his parents he told me
about the things I should do with them
and the things I shouldn't. At first I was
ok because it would actually help me
knowing how to properly behave with
them but now I feel like he wants me to
follow a specific script.
And now I feel like I have to act like a
robot with them like my bf is
programming me to be the perfect
daughter in law for his parents.
For instance he tells me things like “Ask
my mom/my dad/my sister this specific
question” “act this way with my sis”
And it’s starting to give me a headache.
Also he talks a lot to his mom so I know that everytime I leave their home, or simply when I’m not there, she made comments about me and how I am.

For instance; In my family, besides family events, we don't eat together so no need to dress the table. In my bf family they do this so in the processus I was participating but I was kinda lost and slow because I didn’t know what to bring from the kitchen.
So his mom told him I was kind of a passive person.

My bf keeps saying to me she has much more positive thoughts than negative ones about me but at the same time he tells me things that get me pressured like “I tell you the negative remarks she makes so you can improve yourself and show her you can take care of me because she wants to be sure about that”

According to my bf since it’s his family I have to listen the way he wants me to act with them. 
I agree he can give me directives but I really don’t like that I have to follow everything he says. It’s not natural. The fact that his mom has always something to say about me is also disconcerting. I’m not mad at her for worrying about his son but I’m starting to be mad at him because he’s letting her. He embellishes things by saying that’s that just the impressions she has on me but I actually feel like it is actually criticism and he doesn’t get that.
When it comes to my family the only things I told him was to speak, dress  and behave properly . I also told him that I expect him to gradually have a good relationships with my brothers. That’s all. 
Also my parents generally don’t comment on him. (I’ll don’t let them anyway)

Repost for character count. Title sounds bad but bear with me.

I (29M) often watch my cousins (13F, 11M and 10M). I love these kids like younger siblings, but their mom/my aunt, I'm not so fond of. At every family gathering, she berates me for not giving my parents grandchildren (I'm gay and not really up on the idea of parenting). That's not the point of this situation though. 

I took the kids to see The Batman (which I was hesitant because reviews said it wasn't for kids) but I have a hard enough time saying no to them so I agreed. Auntie is under this impression that because I work at the nearest theater screening the film that I can get all of them in for free. I've told her it only works for myself and one other, which I typically give to the 13yo since she's over the age limit for child price. 

They all got a bunch of concessions, leaving a mess behind. I silently apologized to my co-workers, and paid for everything. They loved the movie. I was asleep (I was running on 2hrs of sleep). The 10yo woke me after and were ready to go but then I saw the 13yo leave her half full bucket of popcorn and shrug it off. It more or less went down like this:
Me: Aren't you going to throw that away?
13yo: Why? Isn't that why janitors are hired?
Me: Look around you. Don't you think you can at the very least help them out?
13yo: Are you going to pay me for it?
Me: No...
13yo: Then I don't see why I should. 

I don't bring up the fact that the morning person has to clean up after the last show, morning person being me. The other two threw theirs away. We got to my aunt's and 13yo tells her how I ""made them clean up after other people"". Aunt starts to yell at me but the 11yo gives her the truth. Aunt tells me not to raise her kids. I retorted that someone should because she's doing a pretty shit job of it. 

A cleaning worker comes out of the bedrooms (this is a three bedroom house). I added that it's a wonder she can clean up after herself if she has a maid. I slipped the maid a tip, that's when Auntie lost it. She accused me of making her look bad in front of her kids, how my ""better than everyone else"" attitude is why I can't find a relationship (I just don't want one right now), and that I'm leeching off my parents by not moving out (I live with my best friend and his girlfriend but I don't tell her everything). 

After I left, my phone started blowing up with texts from the extended family, calling me an AH and stuff about me being a ""terrible, ungrateful nephew"". I told my parents what happened and my mom (aunt's sister) said Auntie's doing what she does best, being a drama queen. My folks, bless them, are the ones who taught me to empathize with people working in customer service. 

Am I the asshole for calling out my aunt's parenting and giving the cleaning woman a tip for putting up with Auntie's behavior?

Four years ago, my grandmother died and left me a little chunk of change. Her specific directions said to spend it on an asset to better my quality of life.

I agreed to buy a house with my dad out of state basically in the middle of the woods. 90 min to the nearest Walmart. (Huge culture shock considering Im from San Diego.)

I paid $7000 for the down payment and $2000 for the moving truck. My dad is a real estate agent and his lender insisted that I write it off as a ""gift."" (I never in a million years anticipated that my dad would do me like this.)

We bought the house for $179,000. The mortgage was $1100 per month. My boyfriend and I paid $550 , Dad and his wife paid the other half (ish) 

At the two year mark, my boyfriend and I got into an argument. I took my son for a vacation down to San Diego for about a month. When I was getting ready to return, my dad told me I was not welcome back. His wife was diagnosed with cancer and they did not need any stress. A few months later my boyfriend eventually moved back to San Diego to be with his son and I. 

Dad and wife are paying the full $1100 mortgage for the next two years. Wife does not encourage Dad to have a relationship with his children so we dont hear from him much.

Dad's wife passes away. He immediately sells the house (doesnt tell me it sold!) I find out through Zillow it sold for $400 k...

As it stands now, I am an unemployed stay at home mom who goes to Cosmetology school at night (a hour away and gas is killing me.) My ex bf moved out last month and was still helping with rent. A few days ago he was laid off from work and cant contribute towards  the rent anymore. We might have to go to a shelter. All things considering, even if I wasnt in a shit position I think I still deserve at least 25% of the equity. He wont even give me $20 for gas. My entire family has ganged up oh me calling me a selfish asshole. I feel like Im in the twilight zone. So Reddit, AITA???

**MUM NEEDS TO SHUT UP OR PUT UP (the $$$$$$$)**

Some thoughts/ideas/options

My sister had a small wedding. Similar reasons to yours.  She got married at a beautiful registry office in a room that would only accommodate 14 people we went for High tea at a lovely hotel afterwards and in the evening a small load of friends turned up at a small chinese restaurant and they laid on a buffet.

Many old churches have church halls have you thought about having the wedding at an odd time late afternoon and then having a cocktail party afterwards in their church hall...Had another friend who did that cost again. It was lovely. Or again laying on high tea. 

You get good summers in Toronto what about a relaxed BBQ..orchard type wedding.

Ultimately this is your special day not your mothers. She had her turn. These are memories for you and your groom to keep for the rest of your life not your mother....so it should be the way you want. Not everyone wants 250 people and a ship in full sail dress.

To give some background I live in Toronto, which right now has some of the world's highest property and raising costs.

Me and my fiance have been looking to plan a wedding, but a local wedding is insanely priced. The moment you mention a wedding at any hall the price per person basically doubles.

So we have basically have decided to do a destination wedding. We are doing a church wedding here and a treating the destination more as a reception.

We have explained that it is too expensive to do a wedding here and we would rather spend that money on a house, which is crazy given the property values in Canada.

She doesn't understand that and her advice ""don't worry about the future, take on a loan to pay for the wedding and don't think about the future""

My mom has totally shit on this plan from the beginning. She's mentioned that people can't travel or it would be too expensive for people to travel and that this isn't a real wedding.

It has honestly been a cloud over this wedding for me and she has made me think that I am the asshole.

The other day I had a family weekend at my dad's house consisting of me, my siblings and him (we grew up without a mother). We decided beforehand that I was going to cook this time so I picked my recipe and did the groceries and got ready to start cooking a salmon dish. 

I cooked while my family sat at the table (the dining room is in the same room as the kitchen) and while I was cooking my dad got agitated and told me I was doing it wrong (read: not in the way he would do it). Whenever he starts with this, he has the annoying habit of immediately aggressively taking it out of my hands and doing it himself, not to help but because he is too eager to interfere whenever he sees anything that makes me seem 'incompetent' and he wants it done his way. I got annoyed and told him I knew very well what I was doing and that I literally had the recipe right there, which i was following to the letter. 

He barged into the kitchen and told me to give it to him and that he would do it. Told him no again and he tried to aggressively take over as I had expected. At that point I wasn't having it and held the salmon above the trashcan, telling him ""Either I cook this or nobody does"". He backed down and spent a good deal of time sulking at the table and our heated interaction soured the mood. 

I'm not sure if my reaction was called for, but this is not the first time he's done this sort of thing. Immediately aggressively taking over for minor things like me asking how he wants something done or cutting something the 'wrong' size and I've just about had it. What was supposed to be a fun family night turned into an awkward silence for a good while. Thankfully we managed to pick the atmosphere back up and I buried my annoyance with my dad for a bit for the sake of the night. 

Did I get too heated or go too far?

So I haven't been getting much sleep lately due to my neighbors new born baby .as expected the baby cries during the night. This cant be helped. I'm not some cold idiot who would tell someone to silence their child. However the crying wake me up every single night. It loud and echoes. I dont know what to do anymore. I wondered why the crying was so loud in my bedroom but then I realised that a window directly across from my bedroom window is open and after some queries (we share the same landlord) in found out it was and empty bedroom. Snd also the baby sleeps in the bedroom next to it
 This made sense now. My landlord told me to just ask them to close it. My sister on the other hand says I'm being an insensitive AH for asking them to adjust their home for me. I thought it  would have been a reasonable request.

t6my4r,hzfusqb,t3_t6my4r,"I didn't read enough to know if anyone else explained it, but you're not parentifying your step daughter.

Parentification is abuse because it steals the person's childhood and forces them to suffer the anxiety of being responsible for another human's wellbeing, well before a person if physically or mentally capable of handling such responsibility.

Some examples include forcing your child to babysit constantly so that they can't have a life. Preventing them from having friends or joining extra curriculars at school, or even just being able to manage their normal school responsibilities, because they have to babysit children who need constant supervision. Putting your own desire for freedom and fun above your responsibility to your own children. 

Other examples would be neglecting your children to the point that one of them feels they have to care for the others, feeding them because they know they'll go hungry otherwise. Getting them to school knowing otherwise they'll just be absent. Helping them with homework because they know no one else will.

You are not parentifying your step daughter because, first and foremost, she wants the responsibility. She's happy to help out with this minor task.

So I (31f) and my husband (31m) have 2 children together (7f and 3m) we also have his daughter from a previous relationship (11f) live with us full time.

For a bit of backstory, a few months ago I got bad food poisoning while also suffering a miscarriage simultaneously so was quite poorly, and without going into too much detail one morning I simply couldn’t leave the bathroom, it was a school day and a friend of mine was picking them up for school/nursery due to me being so ill (husband is emergency services so couldn’t take the day off) I called down to stepdaughter and asked if she could just do some cereal for all of them and she happily did it.

She has taken it upon herself to do this every morning, I’ve told her many times she doesn’t have to and I can do it now I’m better, but she’s told me she enjoys doing it in the morning and she likes being in charge of the cereal (she gives us a list of what cereal she wants us to buy every week now and we oblige)

The problem now comes from this past weekend, stepdaughter went to her bio mums house, she only goes about once every 3/4 months, and apparently she tried to make her and her brother cereal that morning and told her mum she has that responsibility at home, I got an angry phone call telling me I’m parentifying stepdaughter. I have never told her this is something she has to do, and I only asked her the once to help, I explained everything to her mum but she wouldn’t listen. She now calling me and asshole and posting all over her social media saying I’m using stepdaughter as another parent which I do not, the most she does is the breakfast and if I nip toilet I just ask if she can keep an eye on 3 year old for a minute. 

So am I the asshole for asking my stepdaughter to make breakfast?

There are 4 of us sharing a flat, and of course the dishes pile up fast, so usually there is not much space, but one flatmate in particular just leaves multiple pans and plates covered in food in the sink for days at a time before washing them. I will go to do my wash and have to move his 3 day old pasta pots or fish pans out of the sink somewhere else.
I have asked him to try put it out of the sink because all four of us share it but he still does it.

Would I be the asshole for just washing my stuff over his and letting any of my gravy/food that washes off land on his plates and leave it there because I don’t want to touch his? I just find it gross to move or clean other peoples used utensils

So my (17 F) friend (17 M) texted me recently. We havent really kept in touch but I still consider him a friend

Im not gonna type the convo out word for word since ik he uses reddit but basically he told me one of his friends cut him off and told him that their mental health has taken a toll and they can't deal with him constantly venting to them.

I told him that's completely understandable since imo if someone's problems are hurting you too you're under no obligation to hurt yourself just to help them.

He called me cold hearted and blocked me.

So, it was my birthday yesterday (which was a Friday night). I had my brother and one of his friends coming over to my apartment to celebrate. It was 4 of us in the whole apartment as me and my gf live here anyway. 

I decided to not play any music and leave to tv turned off so we are not being too loud and not bothering anyone. Therefore we were sitting in the living room, talking till 5 in the morning, and having a few biers.

That is all what happened, my brother and his friend left at 5am in the morning and me and my gf went to sleep.

However in the morning I got a handwritten letter from my neighbour saying that they’re gonna complain about us to some agency (we rent from a private landlord btw so that doesn’t make any sense but OK) because we were too loud. Just for clarification we weren’t screaming or anything, we were literally just talking.

 I have a couple roommates and we usually just do our own thing. We usually eat our own food and do our own dishes. Everything is well till one day I came home and saw that he was cooking rice. He had just made some for him and his gf. I got annoyed because I noticed that he was using MY rice to cook and didn’t even ask me about it. I’m Asian. I have a bag of 40 lb rice. We keep that mf thang stocked. If he had asked me I would’ve said yes. 

 I went over to the pot and saw that there were still a lot of rice left over. I fixed myself a plate and started eating. When he came out of his room he was pissed and confronted me about it. He said that he made extras on purpose so he could have some for tomorrow. I called him out and said that he cooked my food without asking and he replied saying that it’s just rice and he’s the one who spent time preparing it. He told me I could’ve at least asked if I could have some. I got upset and told him I shouldn’t have to ask him for permission to eat my own food. I told him if he doesn’t want me to eat it, he should cook his own food next time. Honestly, I would’ve just let him have some if he had just shoot me a text before cooking it. I admit I grabbed a plate(I was also hungry) because I was annoyed at what he did. If he had asked and I came home hungry I would’ve made my own food even though there’s some leftover.

     I have a couple roommates and we usually just do our own thing. We usually eat our own food and do our own dishes. Everything is well till one day I came home and saw that he was cooking rice. He had just made some for him and his gf. I got annoyed because I noticed that he was using MY rice to cook and didn’t even ask me about it. I’m Asian. I have a bag of 40 lb rice. We keep that mf thang stocked. If he had asked me I would’ve said yes. 

     I went over to the pot and saw that there were still a lot of rice left over. I fixed myself a plate and started eating. When he came out of his room he was pissed and confronted me about it. He said that he made extras on purpose so he could have some for tomorrow. I called him out and said that he cooked my food without asking and he replied saying that it’s just rice and he’s the one who spent time preparing it. He told me I could’ve at least asked if I could have some. I got upset and told him I shouldn’t have to ask him for permission to eat my own food. I told him if he doesn’t want me to eat it, he should cook his own food next time. Honestly, I would’ve just let him have some if he had just shoot me a text before cooking it. I admit I grabbed a plate(I was also hungry) because I was annoyed at what he did. If he had asked and I came home hungry I would’ve made my own food even though there’s some leftover.

For some backstory, early on in my life my parents had become quite entrenched in alternative medicine, and as such raised me with it. I honestly never blamed them, it was in a time when nerves were high and they ended up finding comfort in religious devotion and alternative approaches to medicine.

Whilst I can't say I wasn't bitter about such when I became an atheist and got my jabs and mess somewhat late in life, I learnt that I can't really blame them because it's not like they did it out of malice.

But where I still have an objection is that my parents like to buy ""health products"" from friends and family who participate in multilevel marketing schemes, and they continue to do so after I explained how it's all a scam and literal nonsense.

Not too long ago my dad was beginning to have his usual seasonal allergies, which he tries to treat with drops of essential oils mixed with water. But this time he got a new blend of oils with a different formulation, and this time when he swallowed them, he began to have an allergic reaction, coughing hard and his face was turning red and struggling to breathe. I don't drive, and I offered to call an ambulance but my dad told me he would be fine and to call mom. I was worried shitless at this point, I just whipped out my phone and dialed 911 and told them what was happening, and an ambulance was dispatched and dad was taken to the ER.

About a day later we got a call from the hospital saying my dad was in stable condition but he had a severe allergic reaction to something in the oil, which will need further determination but he would be discharged soon. After that we picked up dad from the hospital.

Initially my dad was overjoyed to see us, but then during the car ride he began to lecture me about ""being impulsive"" and calling an ambulance instead of letting mom come to take him, or hiring an Uber instead, comparing my actions to other ""OCD impulses"" that have gotten me into trouble in the past.

I snapped then and there. I loudly told him to STFU and that anaphylaxis is no fucking joke, the difference between life and death could have been minutes or even seconds, that I did what any reasonable person would do and that I saved his life, he has NO right to berate me. He retorted by saying that I didn't save him, the doctors did, and that he could have died by contracting a MRSA infection in the hospital. At that point it just went into full on screaming and arguing and I can't remember anything when angry.

Even after that my dad continued to guilt me about it to the point where today I'm going to my sister's house after college because he tried to tell me that because I called an ambulance, I would pay for the uncovered portion of the ambulance ride, and I just hung up then and there.

But I'm honestly torn apart, and the issue has really divided my extended family. Some say I should have considered ambulance costs whilst others say I was justified in calling such, and I really don't know.

My husband called me and asked me to tell his mother he was with me two days ago if she asked. When I asked him why, he told me he would explain when he got home. 

My mother-in-law called me an hour or so after he called me and asked me if I had been with my husband two days ago. I’m not good at lying, so I tried to say as little as possible. She asked me a few more questions which made it very obvious I was attempting to lie and she called me out on it. I admitted I hadn’t seen my husband for a week. She sounded upset and told me she would talk to me later as she needed to call my husband.

Later on my husband called me again and he was angry that I had exposed him. I told him I hadn’t wanted to lie and he said my loyalty should’ve been to him, not his mother.

AITA?

So at work today I (30M) was talking with a couple female coworkers about bad experiences we've had at past jobs. We eventually got to the point where they started talking about a lot of the shit they've had to go through as women. 

I agreed and said I'm very fortunate that I've only had one experience in my working life where I have experienced a form of sexism. They were curious so they asked about it.

The short version of the story is that, when I was 25 at a previous job, a female coworker who I really didn't know came up to me, and commented that I had put on some weight. Not only that, but she patted my stomach while doing so. I was really stunned in the moment and didn't react, but after I had composed my self, I told my Executive Director about it. He said he'd speak to my coworker about it, but that I should probably just let it go because her culture is just more intimate and physical.

When I finished telling my current coworkers this story, once of them, V, asked ""So where was the sexism? It doesn't seem to me like there was anything really there.""

I asked her what she meant and her response was ""Well it's not like you went through a super traumatic experience or anything.""

And I told her I knew I didn't, and that I was aware that this was nothing compared to the sexual harassment many women do go through, but I still felt it was a case of sexism. I said if the roles were reversed and I had patted the coworker's stomach and commented on her weight, I would have been severely disciplined, if not outright fired.

V got really huffy and aggressive saying that I had no idea what real sexism was like and that I had ""no right to act like the feminist you claim to be."" Before storming off and cursing me out under her breath.

I wasn't trying to say I had ever experienced anything remotely bad as what she or anyone else had, but I'm wondering if I really put my foot in my mouth by even bringing up the story in the first place.

I don't hear you saying you know exactly how they feel when they're being harassed, but you certainly know how they feel when the harassment is dismissed.

>Edit for clarity: I don't think what my coworker did was sexism or harassment, but rather my boss's reaction to just let it go

I agree but I also disagree. I was about to say ""if the genders were reversed"" but you know what? The genders usually are reversed, and the man dismisses what the woman has said, just like she did with you.

I (26m) took several days off from work to plan something for my birthday next week (3/9). My boyfriend of seven years (29m) will be going on a bike packing trip with my dad, where they'll be cycling across the state for a week.

 I told him I planned on going out of state for the four days I took off since he won't be home. He seemed quiet about it, and when I asked, he said he doesn't think it's a great idea since he knows how expensive everything is. I informed him about how I planned my spending out; flights were reasonable, I had some money set aside for food and any purchases, and was planning on staying at a hostel. He disagreed with it all and just said to just choose somewhere local to stay.

When I mentioned his bike packing trip he said it wasn't going to be nearly as expensive and we both have just dropped the subject. I'm worried I'll be the asshole if I go against him and just go on a trip.

Don't lie to your children and tell them that they're getting treated the same as your step-daughter.  Your kids already KNOW that they aren't, and they will resent you for lying to them.

Without knowing how old your kids are, it's hard to know what advice to give here.  Definitely talk with a therapist about age-appropriate ways to approach your children about your step-daughter and the reasons for the favoritism.  Depending on their age, they may already have some idea of what happened, especially if your husband's family discusses things when your kids are within earshot.  Kids always seem to hear things that aren't meant for their ears.

Telling your kids to be happy they don't need the same things your step-daughter does really isn't a great approach IMO.  But telling your kids that things aren't always fair is important because things aren't always fair or equitable.  Acknowledge their feelings about what's going on, and tell them it's OK to have those feelings.

IMO, the way your husband's family is openly treating your children so poorly in comparison to your step-daughter is wrong on every level.  Your children did nothing wrong here.  They are innocent.  If your step-daughter is living independently, has no financial worries, and is doing OK, the excuse that your in-laws don't have time for your children doesn't hold up.

It’s also becoming clearer that your options are limited: either a therapist finds a way to explain it so it doesn’t hurt them, your husbands family changes, or you go no contact. 

You can try the first, but I wouldn’t expect miracles. Your children feel less loved and they are correct. Your in laws may love them in theory, but not in application. That’s not enough for a relationship but more to Han enough for resentment. A therapist can only explain that so many ways. 

Talking to your husbands family seems like it would be even more challenging. If they’re this wrapped up in their guilt, they will likely see your concerns as complaining that your kids aren’t getting nice stuff or you failing to acknowledge the sisters pain. I think you know the odds of this going well are low since you moved to low contact. 

That leaves going no contact. Which means persuading your husband and putting your visits with sister in a weird spot. I doubt you want to risk making her feel bad over how others are treating your kids, but seeing as she is an adult, she probably already has and isn’t comfortable bringing it up. I would worry less about hurting her feelings— it sounds like she’s reasonably independent and can form a relationship with your children unassisted by her problematic relatives. Talking to your husband will be harder because he seems deeply mired in pointless guilt. Nothing he can do will ever “make up for” or “undo” what happened to his daughter. If anything, this situation might be making her quietly feel shitty. Even if he is unable to confront his toxic guilt, it doesn’t matter. You are responsible for your childrens well being. This is almost certainly already damaging them. What they take away from this is the important question. That sisters pain and fathers guilt is more important than them and their place in the family?

Our family dynamics are extremely complicated. My husband had his first child at 19 with a much older woman. He got pushed out of her life and while he wanted to fight for her in court, he got manipulated out of it because he was ""already uninvolved"". He did pay child support, but there were no visits and the mother left the state shortly after the child was born.

When the daughter was 17, the full story finally came out through federal agents coming to his door. He was floored by what the reality of the situation was and had always been. He was crushed by guilt and only wanted to help his daughter, but obviously, when you've lived a life where your version of teenage rebellion is working with federal agents to free yourself from your household, no normal family dynamic or rule is ever going to apply, so she has never been able to safely live with her father or anyone in the family.

He has been able to help her with the legal side of things including suing her mother. I'm not going to go into detail, but if it helps to illustrate the situation, her mother is legally required to pay her health insurance premiums for the rest of her life. Her grandparents on both sides helped by creating various trusts for her, and her father both put his own money into it and gave up any inheritance from his parents for her, as he should. She's not mentally or physically able to work full time, but with how things settled, she doesn't really need to.

My husband and I now had kids together, and his family comparatively don't do anything for our kids. On holidays, the grandparents and aunts all give his oldest gifts and give our kids dollar store presents if anything. They also visit his oldest often but only see ours on major holidays. 

The kids are now getting old enough to notice this, and they want to know why. I think they're far too young for the full truth. They aren't mature enough or old enough. My husband wants to tell them that it's because she suffered and they should be happy that they don't need it the way she does, but I don't think that's right either. While in this case my stepdaughter absolutely deserves the money and attention she gets from the family, I don't want to teach a moral value on money like that as a rule. I think we should just tell them that they are treated the same and leave it at that, but my husband is arguing that I'm ""gaslighting"" by doing that and that we need to be honest. AITA?

I get that the family wants to go above and beyond for the oldest given what she been through. I’m not sure I agree that’s the way to go about it when it comes to visits and gifts, maybe it make sense with any financial planning or contributions to her care if since she is unable to work and sounds like she needs a much higher level of care. But they should not be ignoring the other kids and doing literally the bare minimum for them. Not visiting as much or spending an equitable amount on gifts for all the kids is not going to make or break the oldest daughters ability to be set financially. If they spend $800 on the eldest for xmas gifts and $50 each for the other two they could just as easily spend $300 on each and the younger two aren’t left feeling like crap. People should not measure love in material things but when the disparity is shoved in your face like that it’s gotta sting.

And you should definitely find an age appropriate way to tell them why she gets more care. If you just pretend like it’s not happening you will be gaslighting them and that will just mess with their heads even more. You need a therapist to help you find a way to talk to them about this and you need a therapist to talk to about the situation because you are screwing this up and you’re gonna end up with three kids with messed up childhoods instead of one.

This actually happened in the last winter break when my older sister[21F] and I[20M] came back from our respective colleges back home where my younger brother[18M] and younger sister[16F] are.

Our parents were picking up dinner from a restaurant on a certain night during the break, so we were all just hanging out together doing our own thing. In general, my family is pretty close-knit, but I’ve never been close with my younger sister. Don’t get me wrong, I do love her just as much as my younger brother and older sister, but we just have absolutely no interests in common and our personalities don’t mesh well so in terms of true favorites, she’s at the bottom.

Out of nowhere my younger brother asked if any of us had a least favorite sibling. My two sisters and younger brother said no, but I said yes, since I was being honest and I didn’t think I would have to say who it was. However, after a lot of peer pressuring I finally gave in and said my younger sister was my least favorite. After that pretty much everything became awkward and I could tell that my younger sister was on the verge of tears. Since then we’ve only talked like once to each other and that was because the kitchen sink was leaking towards the end of the winter break.

AITA? I was just being honest lmao I didn’t mean to hurt my sister.

My coworkers are married. I work in retail. They constantly switch their schedules around so that they match and it ends up screwing me over. Today I was going to be left alone for 7 hours because of them changing their schedules and I finally had enough of it and asked them if they even got approval for it. I was visibly upset and the guy ended up telling me he would leave and come back later so I wasn’t left alone for so long. I said okay. But I’m sick of them doing this to me and then acting like it’s no big deal. The girl in the relationship will act like I’m being dramatic and I really want to ask why it is okay to do this to me when I know she wouldn’t be okay with it being done to her. It’s really stressful. 

Today I went to management and told them I was going to be screwed for 7 hours alone on a Saturday because of them doing this again. They said they would look into it and told them to stay or come back later. The girl obviously thought I was being dramatic and was like “well this other guy called out”. Yeah, he did. And you guys also switched your schedules and didn’t care how it would affect me and it tends to happen a lot. I was walking around almost crying at the thought of having to be alone AGAIN. I feel like any time I stand up for myself I’m viewed as an asshole and I just don’t know anymore. What could I possibly even do differently other than just take it.

This should be pretty short, I toasted some bread yesterday, but was planning to pan fry it as well after, so I didn't need it extra toasty, just wanted to warm it up a bit first. With this in mind, I lowered the toaster setting to ""2"", made my sandwich, and moved on with my day. 

&#x200B;

This morning my girlfriend goes to toast some frozen waffles and they come out still cold in the middle. She eventually figures out that this is because ""someone lowered the toaster setting to '2', it's supposed to stay at '3'!"". Then a (light-hearted) argument ensued and her point of view is that ""3 is the default setting. When you're done using the toaster at a different setting, always bring it back to 3"". My stance is that it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure the toaster matches their required setting for whatever they plan to do with it.

&#x200B;

AITA for not changing the dial on my toaster back to ""the default"" after using it?

I quit my job and my ex-employer (they are in a position over me) keeps texting and wanting to talk to me on the phone. I respond to a few texts here and there to be polite but they constantly want to talk to me on the phone. I also really dislike talking on the phone. When I worked for them they would tell me really personal things and ranted to me all the time. I do not want to get into too much detail but I felt very emotionally manipulated when I worked under them and eventually quit later. I do not want to talk to them on the phone but they keep reaching out. Would it be rude to ignore them? They also know where I am working now so they could come see me and I feel like they will ask why I wasn't responding. I just want to live in peace and move on.

As someone who's frequently been in your shoes (except, I was in management for many of them), my ear and door were always open and it is a role I've played a lot being the ""therapist"". As a quiet and observant leader, and also a bit introverted, I seemed to be the one that people would come talk to.

If any of these personality traits apply to you, know that they likely aren't realizing they are taking advantage of this, but that you are someone people obviously inherently trust. These are amazing character traits to have, but there is a risk to them in how you are feeling.

I (19F) have some conditions (which are recognized as a disability) so I don’t always attend my lectures, l work from home a lot and I do all of my examinations in a special room for differently-abled students. These are my accommodations approved by academic services and my profs. (this does not impede my academic performance at all, I am one of the top students in my program). One of my classes had a two-stage exam with an individual written portion and a group discussion (followed by a write-up) portion. I did my written exam in the accessibility room and went into class to join my assigned group (throughout the semester) for the discussion. 

One group member (21F) said “so happy you decided to finally show up”. I ignored her and no one else commented and we started our discussion. Whenever I would try to participate she would always cut me off and interrupt me. After a few times I asked why she wasn’t letting me participate and she said “I don’t think  you have anything of worth to contribute”. I was hurt and offended by her comment and I said that my contribution was just as valid as everyone else’s and asked her to let me participate so that I could get my grade. She laughed and said “you’re almost never here and you showed up an hour late and missed half of the exam, why do you suddenly care about your grades? why did you even bother to show up?” 

This hurt me even more and I explained that it was none of her business and that she doesn’t know my situation. I told her that everyone else in the group might be thinking the same thing but were polite enough to not comment because it doesn’t concern them. She just continued to laugh and say my only situation was laziness. I told her that I have disabilities, so I have different accommodations than the rest of the students. She got defensive and said that she had no way of knowing that so me “pulling THAT card” wasn’t fair. I told her that even if she didn’t know, she also had no way to know if I had any other valid reason for not always being in class and said her behaviour regardless is still rude and uncalled for.

The other group members sided with me and told her she was being an AH and she began backpedaling. I told her I didn’t want to work with her anymore. I got up and informed my professor about the situation and she also sided with me and said that I could do the second portion of my exam one-on-one with her and that I would no longer be in that group. I thanked her and left.

My prof informed academic services about the situation (I never asked her to) and this girl has now been removed from her position on the student council, lost an internship opportunity and my friends told me that the story has gone around and people have begun avoiding her. Some of my friends told me that I should have not said anything because now her life is being ruined because of what I did.

I do feel sorry for her, but at the same time I don’t feel I did anything wrong, AITA?

My Uncle (31M) and my aunt (26F) have recently gave birth

My aunt and uncle have been trying to a while now but finally had the infant. Before the infant was even born, they where weird about it. My uncle made some down right sexist comments if he had a girl. He said ""I don't want to have to deal with a girl man, I don't want to have to worry about her getting pregnant, or periods, or her getting an ""onlyfans,"" I just want a boy because they're easier to take care of"". Me and a couple other family members bit our tongues on this until the sex of the baby of the baby was revealed, a boy. I was kind of happy at this because I was worried my uncle was going to be one of those emotionally neglectful fathers, who only cares about their male children. So around 3-4 months later they gave birth.

My family was happy about the birth of their child until they started sending some weird messages to our family group chat. They started sending images of their baby in the hospital nursery showing their son next to a female baby saying he got a ""girlfriend"" and saying that he was a ""ladies man"". A majority of my family found no problem in this and some even went on to say it was ""cute"" and that it looked like he was ""flirting"" with the female baby. This didn't sit right with me and I said ""Isn't it a bit weird to call your newborn baby a ""ladies man"" and a ""pimp"". Most of my family members told me it was ""fine"" and that he was ""just trying to encourage his son to be a gentleman"". My uncle later texted me telling me it was ""not weird"" and told me I was being ""sensitive"" and that him and my aunt just was to celebrate the birth of a new born child and I was ruining it for them. This comment made me question what I said and. my stance on this, so reddit, AITA?

So I honestly have no idea if IATA in this situation so I'm now here. Tonight I (22 white female) was having a birthday party for my Japanese born friend Hannah (19 female).

We ended up playing a game where each player will choose one of the players that fits the description on a card best. At the end of the game being bored I just whent through the whole stack and made piles of my personal choices for each card. 

One of my guests saw my actions and became curious so I pointed out whose stack was which. Several minutes later I am then accused of being racists and stereotyping Hannah by giving her the card ""most likely to cure cancer"" by Sasha (African /Asia American 26 female). 

I then whent on to explain that while I am aware of stereotypes that might make it seem that was the reason I chose her that was not it at all. I chose her because she had yet to choose a career path while everyone else in room was either entreprenurship, marketing, teaching, or journalism. 

I was then informed by Sasha she had an associates in a science related field and by that logic it should have been her chosen. My response was while she may have those credentials 1 her current career path is entrepreneurship (a bridal boutique) so the likelihood of her using that is lessened and while an associates does open up more opportunities than anyone else currently considering she had no intention of using or further education it became somewhat nulvoid. Then whent on to say combing that generally those who work in that field spend years in school and then researching, her career path was in a complete different direction, and that she has no current plans to work in a science related field. Due to those reasons I still stick with my original choice because Hannah is undecided who would have been given any card that does not relate to the prior mentioned fields.

Sasha seemed very upset by this choice and Hannah seemed confused about why this conversation had even become so heated. At the end of the night I just shut it down because we were only going in circles and becoming more agitated at each other. 

So was my choice really that bad? AITA?

My grandfather passed away at the end of January this year, and it has been very difficult for my extended family and we are all very close. I am also feeling a lot of different emotions between grieving and looking towards the future. I am very conflicted.

Is it selfish of me to want to have a party at the end of May to celebrate my master's degree graduation? For context, I finished undergrad in 2020 & did not get to walk or have any type of celebration due to the pandemic. I worked so hard for my master's degree and I want to be able to celebrate that in the next coming months when I graduate in May. However, my parents are not sure if it would be appropriate given my family's stage of grief right now. If I went forward with planning a celebration, I would of course understand if some of my family did not feel ready to attend. 

WIBTA if I moved forward with planning a graduation celebration?

Why is the teacher “at risk of getting fired” and who in the name of human resources policy violations told you that? It seems kind of odd that a sub would flagrantly perpetrate a terminable offense in front of a roomful of witnesses and then tell everyone they’re “at risk of getting fired.”

On the other hand, it’s weird enough to wonder. If I were going to record my students for some reason, I’d discuss it with them first. I’d also get official permission, and allow students to opt out. 

Ultimately, it’s better to err on the side of caution. If something seems suspicious or makes you uncomfortable, you SHOULD report the matter to the VP. That was the right choice. But you also should have been less arrogant and more respectful toward the teacher.

So I was in a class with a sub, and we were (i admit) being a bit loud, so the sub asked us to be quiet. We did and all was well, we were still chitchatting but nothing unordinary happened until me and a few others notice the sub had taken out her phone and started recording us (we are minors). We kept asking her why she was recording us, but insisted we get back to our work. She kept recording us for a few minutes and I politely asked her to delete the videos. She refused and kept recording. I decided I had had enough, as me and many others were very uncomfortable with the situation. I went to the main office and on my way out of the classroom she stopped and asked me where I was going, I told her and she said “go sit back down” so i told her again to delete the videos. We went back and forth (and i admit, i did have a slight attitude). I ended up walking out and telling the vice principal about it, and she is at risk of getting fired. My teacher is very upset with what I did and now I am feeling a lot of regret. AITA?

Not talking with administration about this before doing it might be the issue though. The students and the school are both AH's for not backing the sub, but I do agree that the sub did several things incorrectly in this situation.

1. Got into a power struggle with the student.

2. Trying to stop the student from walking out. If a student walks out of my classroom, they have made their own bad decisions and I don't need to get in the way of that. I just need to notify my principal and assistant principal that we have a student walking out of class.

3. Recording students. I think it's perfectly legal, especially if the students and the parents sign an AUP, but it is really distracting and seemed to escalate the situation. She should have recorded the behavioral issues by writing the names down of the offending students and allowed the classroom teacher or administration to handle it.

So I say ESH and I doubt the school uses the sub again or if they use her again, it will be with the understanding that she should not do that again.

Some context, I (18f) made the mistake of joining a company that one of my parents also works at. We work in different departments and despite my parent being an upper manager, they don’t technically have any control over my job. Also key, they have shares in the company and I don’t (despite being promised). 

The conflict: I start my day at exactly 9:00am and end it exactly at 5:00. I don’t work a minute over. I take my lunch from 12:30-1:30. I have in the last worked overtime, but this is very rare and only when there is an emergency situation so other people don’t have to fix the problem all by themselves. 

My parents works all hours of the day, barely takes lunch. They get very stressed. Today they called me both ‘stupid’ and ‘lazy’ for sticking to my contracted hours. Lazy because I don’t work longer and stupid because they view the extra hours as integral to my career development (this is not my chosen career path FYI). 

I don’t view the hours after 5:00pm as more important or better training the the 8 hours I worked before it. 

So Reddit AITA? Should I be more willing to work longer hours unpaid? Would this actually help me develop skills quicker?

The other disconnect I think has to do with your parents assuming that this is your chosen career path, and that you are passing up opportunities to further develop yourself.

I (19f) have been looking for a dress for my 6th form prom for ages. I never went to secondary school prom because of covid so I am very excited to finally attend a formal event. My sister (22f) went also only went to one prom because she went to college not 6th form. 

My sister found an amazing dress for £59 on eBay within 2 hours of looking. It was not so easy for me, I dress moderately modest and mid/plus sized so it took me really long to find anything.

I found a £199 dress online and fell in love with it. I couldn't see myself going to prom in anything else.
My parents said that the price is unacceptable and that it would be unfair for them to spend more on me then on my sister. 

I pointed out that this was unfair and it turned into a giant week-long argument. My sister said that I was being manipulative and accused me of thinking I'm better than her. The whole family agrees with her, AITA?

Hi! I’m fairly new here never posted so sorry for any errors. I (F22) was in the shower when my boyfriend (M26) decided to join me. We do this sometimes so it didn’t bother me. (Today was a no wash for my hair day that will be important later). As soon as he gets in he starts peeing and pees on my leg, which to me is kinda gross but he thought it was funny. (Mind you we have a normal shower and tub so not a lot of space”). I move to the back to wash my body as he rinses his hair. He said ends up dropping his bar of soap and said I knocked it out of his hand and told me to pick it up. I thought that was kinda rude and gave it to him anyway. I finish soaping up and move to the front to rinse off. ( I just have my hair in a bun so some area still get a little wet). As I’m leaning back so I can wash off my neck and face he had to spit and he accidentally spit in my bun. He said he “had to spit and I moved my bun back” I said “that’s gross my hair is nasty now” and I just dried off the area and got out of the shower. I didn’t speak to him the rest of the morning as I was waiting for him to apologize. He later texted me after we went to work saying he “doesn’t understand why I’m mad at him”AITA?

It may sound bad, but bear with me. I (17m) am in a very nice, supporting family. We’re all really close, even when we do have our moments of fighting. Thing is, they are both overweight. I am not. I don’t care about them being overweight, it’s the last thing I would even care about. They’re beautiful people with great intentions that support me through anything. 

Due to them being overweight, they have tried many diets and methods of getting thinner. My mother recently tried Jenny Craig, but got bored of it. My dad is doing Noom, which I always joked was a cult whenever the commercials came on. But since we’re going away for March break, they have made much more of an effort to stick to their diets. They talk about them constantly, talk about how different foods are bad, eating healthy meals, etc. This isn’t the thing that bothers me, though.

I’ve always been skinny, and both of my parents were as well in their teens. While making their diets and plans, they tell me that I need to eat better as well to stay skinny. Seeing them constantly doing all this to get thinner makes me feel like I am not doing enough. Whenever I eat ‘bad’ food, or really any food at all, I feel gross afterwards. Like I shouldn’t have ate it all. I weigh myself and am upset at the number, which has been pretty much the same since grade 7 (I’m in grade 12, for context.) 

So, here’s my question. WIBTA if I told them that their dieting/talk of dieting is causing me harm? I don’t want to develop an eating disorder, and even before most of this started, I’ve still struggled with food. 

I’ve asked friends, but I know that can sometimes be an echo chamber of what I want to hear. So, please help me out.

So I took my daughters 3years 6 month and 12 month old to a softplay. My oldest did her usual shoes off and of she went my youngest I obviously go into the baby bit with her. So there's a slight ramp up and a crawl space across to a slide so I was helping my daughter up the ramp and meeting her at the top of the slide to come down. There was a little boy there between 2-3. As far as I was aware unsupervised (mum was sat at a table). So this little boy seems drawn to my baby and starts crawling past her bopping her on the head. He does this a few times and I just say please be careful with her head shes only a baby. Very nicely very softly. Anyway play caries on and boy keeps making a beeline for my baby shes crawling up the ramp and he pushed in to her and clambered on. Then she was at the ramp again with me right behind her, boy makes a beeline for her again at this point shes sat on the ramp turned to face me. Boy crawls up next to her stares at her then with all his force pushes on her belly with his fists and keeps them there. I yelled out ""what are you doing"" so little boy then pulled his hands off my child and I picked her straight up. At this point the mum has took notice stood up and is screaming at me across the baby bit of how dare I speak to her son that way. Its not my place to shout at her son and I should of gone to her and she would of sorted it. 
Firstly. It was reaction to get the child off my baby without pulling the toddler off which wpuld of course been crossing a line!
Secondly. I wasn't aware who the mum was until she started screaming at me, turns out she was having a coffee and working from a table so I cant imagine paying that close attention to her son. 
The screaming and shouting continued I told her what happened.  She told me to get my husband down there as shes about to call hers to come down and ""sort this"" I said there is absolutely no need to call my husband what on earth would be the need for that.
I'm not great at arguing and of course I get all upset to which she called me pathetic and to grow up, I got my kids together and was trying to leave and my toddler seemed really upset and I decided I really didn't want to be ran put of the softplay so I decided to stay even though her husband was on his way. 
He got here and shes starts shouting at him about me and I just said if you want to talk about it sit down but not continuing arguing at a children's play centre. Anyway husband was quite reasonable and turns out didnt start shouting at me ect. To which the mum was a bit miffed at so when he left she started ringing round her mates shouting about how furious she was that some women has just screamed at her son. 
I know it wasnt really the toddlers fault he's only 2 at the end of the day but am I really the asshols for shouting at him whats he doing to get his fists from my babys tummy?!?

So I (36 F) just had a baby girl 3 months ago with my husband (35 M) and it seems that this has brought up a lot of feelings about my own parents and upbringing.

About 6 years ago, we left the state where both sets of our parents/extended families lived for my husband's work about 7 hours’ drive away.

For the last few years we have made the drive up to see family multiple times a year, opting to spend the most time with my husband's family. See, my parents are complete slobs and mild hoarders. They basically do not cull through their stuff like normal people do; they buy tons of random crap, junk up their garage and every surface with clutter no matter what. Also, they also do not clean. At all. My dad calls me a neurotic clean-freak (I'm not.) It got so bad that we had to limit visits because of the dust. 

My Dad had hated moving back to their hometown when my Mom (68 F) insisted they do so in 2008. They made the choice in 2019 (but did not actually move until 2021) to move down to be near me. Though my husband suspects it was selfish, better chances for my Dad (72 M) to find work (as they're not very good with finances). My dad was fired during the pandemic, and my mom had been on disability for years from her accident, once they made that choice, I told them to begin going through their crap, throwing stuff out, listing stuff on Facebook Marketplace, etc. They were two unemployed people with a dog. They did literally none of that. 

Their move was a complete nightmare (an extremely long story) and dramafest for us all. I am disappointed in the way my father treated me while he stayed north emptying their house. Mom got partially moved in,  with Dad to be down with the rest. Every time I talked to my Dad, he would scream and yell. Somehow, he could not even TALK. I felt myself losing my affection for him. I was pregnant doing everything in my power to help them. The entire situation was so infuriating, because I had tried SO HARD, dedicated so much of my time and energy to help, touring homes, helping them pack, offering them advice, paying for stuff, etc. But here I was feeling like the enemy. It was terrible and Mom just made excuses for him ""this is very stressful for him"". 

&#x200B;

Once they were down here and my daughter was born, they only came to visit the baby, never help which is disappointing.  

Mom makes comments about wanting to spend more time with the baby, but the only thing she does is sit down, put her feet up and hold the baby. She has no clue about baby's comfort so the baby doesn’t even have fun. 

In spite of it all, I just feel so guilty over this, because they live 5 minutes away, but I just don't want them around any more than the couple hours a week we see them for dinner. 

Am I the asshole for feeling so resentful of my parents and not wanting to have my Mom over to spend more time with the baby?

Honestly, starting from when you talked about what your son looks like. First you talked about what struggles he's faced in life and then go on to mention traits of those things negatively? If he's autistic and trans, it comes off as extremely insensitive to say in the sentence-after-next that he is a fine man BUT has ""feminine features"" and is socially awkward. Dad of the year right here.

Then you go on to talk about how talented and beautiful Eva is. Smart, pretty, all of the nice things you haven't yet framed your socially awkward kid as. And then you go on to say that if she weren't successful, you'd guess she were a gold digger?? And then continue on to say it was a possibility she was an escort? Jeez, man. Let me unpack this.

Let me set the scene. This is a young woman about to meet her boyfriend's parents. She comes in, trying to make a good impression, and is told by said boyfriend's father that he automatically assumed she were a gold digger/escort because of her looks. As a transgender person (ftm) that constantly gets perceived as female and therefore treated as such, my mind would IMMEDIATELY jump to ""predator alert"" if this happened. You're halfway through a conversation with this young woman and decide that it's okay to make jokes about her being a prostitute? I'd be booking it out of there if I were Eva.

But anyhow, into the issues I'm spotting.

\-If she weren't successful, you'd guess she was a gold digger. Both a dig into her- implying your original thought was that she was a gold digger until she proved you otherwise- and a dig into your son- implying that he's not good enough for her.

\-She could still be an escort. I mean, wow. Even jokingly, this isn't something you say to a young woman when meeting her for the first time. Nothing against sex workers over here, but implying that she may not be successful or attracted to your son is so gross to see. On top of that, you're once again implying your son isn't good enough for her. As if you're saying ""Wow, how did you get her in here without paying her?""

&#x200B;

Have you ever considered that it's possible your son is a fun person that she finds attractive and wants to be with??

The joke also isn't yours to call respectful or offensive. Even if you and your wife find it funny, your son's girlfriend is NOT a punching bag and clearly isn't comfortable with a man old enough to be her father making jokes about her being a sex worker.

My (57M) wife (54F) had two children before we met, the relevant one for this story is Josh (26M). My wife and I have been together for a long time so Ive known Josh since he was very young. He has had a rough childhood, he suffers from autism, had an eating disorder and is transgender. Josh doesnt have a bachelors and is pursuing the arts while working. To be honest, while he's grown into a fine young man, he is quite short, and still has a lot of ""feminine"" features, and is quite socially awkward.

I was surprised when before our latest family dinner, he says he is bringing home a girlfriend for us to meet, and even more surprised when he brings in Eva (24F). Eva was not what I expected. She is gorgeous, very feminine, goes to a top grad school in our area, has a very good part-time job a reputable company, very sociable, bubbly and all. I was honestly shocked, and I joked about this to Eva who laughed along. I made sure to also compliment her so she would feel accepted and know I didn't have any hard feelings.

Dinner is in full swing, and the conversation turns back to Eva. She was talking about a funny situation at work that had the whole table laughing. As she wraps up the story, I say something like ""if you weren't so successful I'd assume you were a gold digger .... I guess you might still be an escort though!"" To be fair, our family is quite wealthy and I really don't think calling a girl successful is an insult. I also don't think the joke was that offensive. But both her and especially Josh seemed very uncomfortable, and Eva didn't speak to me the rest of the night, and they left early. A few people came up to me to say that it wasn't an appropriate joke and that I was an asshole, but my wife and I both think it was a bit of harmless fun, and that they're being a bit too sensitive. My step-son has been ignoring my texts and calls. AITA for making that joke?

Prior to COVID my mother in law would travel abroad with a group of her friends about once a year. Due to COVID she has not been able to see this group for almost 3 years as they all live in different cities. About 1 week ago my MIL gets an invitation to travel abroad this September with this same group of friends.  The dates of the trip coincide with my husband's 40th birthday, and the dates are not flexible as my MIL's friend has already booked a tour. My MIL knows that I enjoy traveling so she invited me to join. To be honest this particular trip did not interest me much so I was likely going to turn her down, but since she was nice enough to invite me I thought it would be reasonable to have a discussion about it. Today I went out to lunch with my MIL and my husband. I decided to bring up the trip in conversation. As soon as I mentioned the dates of the trip my husband says ""you are an a-hole for even considering going on this trip during my birthday"" as he feels that he only gets one 40th birthday. My husband has never been the type of person to have a big party. I asked him what he would like to do for his birthday and he said he would like to go out to a nice dinner with just me and maybe MIL. I tried to explain that we could go out to dinner a different week but he insists that if I am not in town on the exact day of his birthday it would make me a huge A-hole. I asked him if he would be mad if just his MIL goes on the trip and at first he said ""she should feel guilty for missing my B-day"" but later he said that he would be ok with her going without me. Last year I also went on a trip in September but my flight arrived back in town 1 day prior to his actual birthday and we did go out to dinner on his actual birthday. The way I see it is that unless he is planning a big party it shouldn't matter if I am out of town on his birthday as we could always celebrate a different day.  I also don't think he should try to guilt his MIL out of seeing her friends for the first time in 3 years.

I (31F) have a 14 month old with my fiancé (33m). He works full time 5 days a week on shifts 6am-2pm and 2pm-10pm alternate weeks, and I work 2 days a week 8-4pm whilst I am a SAHM the rest of the time(can't afford full time childcare at over £1000 a month.) 

I expect to do alot more with the baby as I'm off more but it's getting to me now. I do all of her bottles, nappy changes, feed her breakfast/lunch/tea, get her dressed and undressed, get up with her in the night. When I come home from work, I take over and he relaxes, when he gets home from work he relaxes and I'm still doing everything in the day. I also cook all our meals and do all the chores, dishes, hoovering, mopping etc,I also bathe her every other night too which he never does. He does do some tidying because he's a clean person but I also do it in the day so there's really not much to do, no dishes left, no mess. One thing he does do is washing the clothes which I don't but that's it. Because he's up at 6am on one week I don't expect him to get up with the baby, but he has lie ins till 11am on the other week and I still get up with her if she cries in the night. The only time he does these things is the weekend I work(every other weekend) because well he has to. I feel largely unsupported. If I ever ask for a nap for an hour he goes silent, and just nods his head. He wouldn't outrightly say no you can't, but I then always feel guilty about wanting a rest.

I'm still angry over a few weeks ago. I was very ill, vomiting and diarrhea for 7 full days (I've only ever thrown up for max two days) and was in a bad way. He still went to a football match from in the morning till 4pm without asking me or even telling me I won't go. He was in work so I had to look after her, he took over when he was home for roughly three hours but would still wake me up and I'd be doing her tea, nappies, getting up with her. I also had covid and did the same.

I'm also in my last trimester of pregnancy and completely exhausted. He is a wonderful man in every other way, just not when it comes to looking after the baby. AITA for wanting to talk to him about stepping up more?

1. It sounds like they are your friends not his. Your friends may not feel as at ease with the addition of an extra person who is not part of your usual group. The way you act around people you are completely comfortable with is different from the way you act with people you are not as uncomfortable with. Your boyfriend’s presence would make it more difficult for your friends to “let down their guard” and truly relax.

2. You may feel caught between giving your attention to your friends vs your boyfriend. Especially if your bf and your friends aren’t very close. Either you focus on your friends and feel bad that he is left out, or you focus on him and you become an isolated couple awkwardly on the fringes of the group.

3. It is healthy to have time apart from your significant other and to have things in your life that are just yours. It prevents codependency and it’s not uncommon to need space every so often, even from the people you love most.

4. The main point of a “girls night” is not the gender of the people involved, or the exclusivity. It is more about spending quality time with your friends. The name comes from the fact that it is not uncommon for the majority of your close friends to share your gender.

5. A common discussion topic during quality time with friends is talking about your significant others. It is obviously much harder to talk about someone who is there.",14,0,0,False,False,False,1646418629.0

The other day, I suggested having a ""girls night"" with my friends, and it struck a nerve with my boyfriend that I didn't know about. He got very upset about it, claiming that the concept of ""girls night"" is inherently sexist and rude. His reasoning was that if he enjoys everything that girls enjoy, the only reason he wouldn't be invited is because he is a guy, and that is, by definition, sexist.

He then asked me directly why he specifically wouldn't be invited. I told him that him being there would change the vibe, and he asked me how. Honestly, I couldn't think of any specific reason *why* or *how* it would change the vibe — I've never thought about that before — so I told him *it just would*. That only made him more upset.

He told me I was being rude and exclusive. I had no idea what to say. I don't know if I'm just flustered or if he has a good point. I have never known anybody to take offense to ""guys night"" or ""girls night"" before. I suppose, by definition, it is an exclusive event in the sense that you must be a girl to participate. At the same time... Though I cannot explain how, I do know that having a guy at ""girls night"" would change the dynamic completely, and my friends would not enjoy it as much.

So, I am genuinely curious, AITA?

If he needs info on why he would change the dynamics, tell him to read The Art Of Gathering. It’s not just about “girls night”—it’s about gatherings/meetings/parties and how different things affect them. It’s enough proof of your point, even though you shouldn’t need to make it.


Quote from the book: “So how, you might ask, do I exclude generously? This issue comes up a lot when I’m organizing large, complicated meetings for clients. These are some of the questions I ask them:
Who not only fits but also helps fulfill the gathering’s purpose?
Who threatens the purpose?
Who, despite being irrelevant to the purpose, do you feel obliged to
invite?
When my clients answer the first two questions, they begin to grasp their gathering’s true purpose. Obviously people who fit and fulfill your gathering’s purpose need to be there. And, though this one is harder, people who manifestly threaten the purpose are easy to justify excluding. (That doesn’t mean they always end up being excluded. Politeness and habit often defeat the facilitator. But the hosts still know deep down who shouldn’t be there.)
It is the third question where purpose begins to be tested. Someone threatens a gathering’s purpose? You can see why to keep him out. But what’s wrong with someone who’s irrelevant to the purpose? What’s wrong with inviting Bob? Every gathering has its Bobs. Bob in marketing. Bob your friend’s girlfriend’s brother. Bob your visiting aunt. Bob is perfectly pleasant and doesn’t actively sabotage your gathering. Most Bobs are grateful to be included. They sometimes bring extra effort or an extra bottle of wine. You’ve probably been a Bob. I certainly have. The crux of excluding thoughtfully and intentionally is mustering the courage to keep away your Bobs. It is to shift your perception so that you understand that people who aren’t fulfilling the purpose of your gathering are detracting from it, even if they do nothing to detract from it. This is because once they are actually in your presence, you (and other considerate guests) will want to welcome and include them, which takes time and attention away from what (and who) you’re actually there for. Particularly in smaller gatherings, every single person affects the dynamics of a group. Excluding well and purposefully is reframing who and what you are being generous to—your guests and your purpose.”",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646438523.0

Your relationship with your friends is not the same as the one with your partner. You’re not building a life together. They aren’t always there.

Maybe you want to be free to talk about other friends’ relationships without feeling like you’re seeing it through the lens of your own.

Hi, sorry if Im doing this wrong, its my first time here and Im not a native speaker.

Context: I (22) am still living with my Mom and Sister (17). My big Brother (30) did move out years ago. I am currently learning to become nurse in Germany (One year to go).

I help much around the house, practically I organise and do nearly everything around here. And its hard, I am already under stress and I cant really relax at home or have time for myself. I find myself not wanting to come home.

A few days ago my big Brother told me about a collegue who wants to rent out his upperfloor. Maybe its too big for me, but its really cheap. Even cheaper than most smaller ones. It would be closer to my brother and the same distance from work. And even if its cheap will it be hard, cause I dont get that much salary. But I think I could make it work.

When I told my Mom about the flat she startet to list reasons why not to go. That I couldnt afford it, that I cant live alone and so on. She told me that I should stay for a few more years. She didnt even let me think on my own, didnt even give it up for debate. Just said why I shouldnt do it and closed the case. My Mom gets money because Im still in trainig and because my father is dead, I think she wants me to stay to keep the money, but I would most likely let her keep it. Another reason would be that the household would most likely crash and burn without me. She says I would be an asshole for abondoning them

I really wanna move out, living here is hard on me, mostly psychological. What if she wont talk to me if I decide to move out? Her way of dealing with fighting is crying and calling herself a bad mother. I dont want her to be sad. What if I dont make it, if I cant live on my own? Im really scared. Then it would all be for nothing.

My brother and his partner think Im in the right for wanting to leave, but my sister thinks I am an asshole for bringing it up.

So would I be the asshole for moving out?

I'm a woman in my mid-30s. A few friends and I went out to eat last night at a Japanese restaurant. We had some drinks and although I wasn't drunk, I was a little louder than usual and I was in a very good mood.  
   
Our waiter was very cute and energetic. Not only did he do a great job, he was also very friendly and we all found him adorable. I was more vocal about this than my friends - I wasn't over the top or creepy, I just told him he was cute and doing a great job.   
   
Afterwards a couple of my friends said I shouldn't have said those things - they thought it was ""patronising"" and pointed out how creepy it would have been if our genders were reversed. I disagree, I wasn't hitting on him - he's cute but much younger and based on his mannerisms I'm pretty sure he's gay. I wasn't attracted to him, I just found him very charming and I was happy with how he was doing his job, he gave us a great experience. Yes i left him a good tip.

I did a thing with my household to help avoid them ""not noticing"" dirty stuff in the house. I typed out a general cleaning list, what needs done daily, weekly, bi weekly, monthly, yearly and put it in a laminated case that I hung on the wall with a dry erase marker. So everyone could just pick something or a couple things a day and then mark off what they did.

The ability to take care of the household is a basic human skill. An adult who is capable of having a full-time job should reasonably be expected to know when to vacuum the floors and how to do laundry. If he doesn't know, it's a skill that can easily be learned.

By not putting in the effort to clean/learn how to run the house in a way that works for him, he's just showing you where his priorities lie.

So this has been on my mind for a while, and I genuinely can’t see if I’m in the wrong/overreacting. 

My (33F) husband (34M) struggles to consistently help out around the house. We both have full time jobs and no kids, but both our jobs are well over 40 hours a week and require a lot of nights and weekends. Because of this, we try to clean/do things around the house when we can fit it in, and it’s usually not at the same time as each other. 

The only thing he will do consistently is the dishes, which I really appreciate. But when it comes to the rest of the house, I end up doing everything! We have a lot of pets so the house needs constant vacuuming and mopping. I bring this up to him allll the time and he promises to get better, but three days later he’s back to doing nothing. He will frequently use the excuse “i didn’t know what needed to be done, You didn’t say you needed help with anything”. I tell him to just look around, if something looks dirty, clean it - I keep reminding him I’m not his mom and I should have to create “chore lists” for him. It’s not difficult.

Anyway after a long week of work, I was fried and begged him to take over most of the cleaning this weekend. He understood and agreed. The next day I come home to find he has ordered a cleaning service to clean the house, while he hung out for the day. I was upset with him and accused him of being lazy. His reasoning was that he could see how stressed I was, and wanted to give us an opportunity to relax together this weekend. I was still pissed and did not talk to him for the rest of the day. We had a few fights over it, and he genuinely can’t understand why I’m getting so mad at him “buying a gift” for the both of us. 

AITA for getting upset? I feel like he was trying to skirt a responsibility that I usually do myself almost every day. Is it too much to ask for him to take over the chores that day without having to pay someone to do it for him?

$500 for the cleaning service??? Whoa that's a LOT.

It might be worth it if he looks at it as a one-time thing to get the cleaning under control so it's easier to keep up with.  Unless he's willing to step up and do more, it's a bit of an empty gesture.

Sadly, some people just don't understand how much needs to be done to keep a house clean (especially with pets!) Or they procrastinate until things pile up and seem overwhelming.

I really do understand where you're coming from OP.  It seems like he took the easy way out, and that he doesn't understand how his refusal to take on responsibility for cleaning and keeping up the house makes you feel.  

I'm a huge proponent of weekly lists of things that need to be done.  Two adults and two cats in a relatively small home can make a bit of a mess, especially when the two adults are super busy and not always very organized.

My cousin,L,(15f) recently got a new boyfriend and although im really happy she has found someone. I wasent happy when i found out she planned to bring him tomorrow to my sisters birthday party. 

My sister(8f) has autism and tomorrow will be stressful already since she has a double header(2 softball games back to back) and then her party, She dosent do good with new people and new people tend to really stress her out. 


L texted my friend and told them what she planned to do and they immediately told me, L explained that they wanted the whole family to meet him and wanted it to happen now instead of later. Which i understand but i dont think this is the right time. L got mad when my friend said i was pissed off about the situation and blew my phone up saying she had already told him and told my mom(Who dosent want conflict so she agreed). 

I dont think Im TA but maybe i am? Im just looking out for yhe wellbeing of my sister as my job is to protect her

I am probably the AH here because I'm doing it out of selfishness. I'm honestly just so tired of sharing everything. I have more than enough reasons. We are both late 20s. 

So heres the thing.. I have purchased one vehicle and leashed one other vehicle in the 5 years we have been together. Both times he wanted his name on the vehicle too and I had no problems with it at first, really. Made no difference to me. But I definitely have built up some resentment about it lately, admittedly. My leased vehicle.. he totaled it. I had the car for a year. He wasnt at fault for the accident but he still totaled it. I ended up owing $2k on the loan after they did the pay out. Because we didnt have $2k to pay up front, I couldnt take out another lease agreement until it was paid off. At that point he was unemployed because of the car accident (broken leg and collarbone) so it was completely up to me because the pay out HARDLY covered his medical bills. 

I ended up getting a beater car because it was all I could afford and we put his name on that one too a d for some reason.. it just pisses me off when he says ""our vehicle"". I dont know why but I'm assuming it's because I truly dont have a single thing in the house that is ""mine"", you know? And sometimes it feels like he rides off my achievements, even though I subconsciously know that's not the case. He is very much a ""what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine""  type of guy. But.. well.. guess who's car is totaled again? Some guy side swiped him 3 weeks ago and he smashed in to a pole. The other person's insurance company only gave us $1200 for the total loss. 

Well I found a vehicle and despite the fact that both of us are working.. I dont want his name on my car this time around. I know it truly doesnt make much of a difference but I just want it to be mine and mine only. I also dont even want him like.. driving my car. Despite the fact that he technically wasnt at fault for either accident. I'm just really tired of sharing my things and then having my shit totaled for no fault of my own. So I told him his name wasnt going on it and now he is pissed, saying I'm treating him like he has done me wrong. AITA?

For starters, this is a throwaway because it's a mess.

I(30f) had my son(11m) after a ons. I was only 19 when I had him and the guy didn't stick around. Because of this, I relied heavily on my family(mom, dad,  and grandma) for the first 6 years of son's life. This is between living with them, financial help when I wasn't making enough. And babysitting. I now own my home with my husband of 3 years right next door to my family and I financially help them to pay them back for the help they gave me.

My cousin, Joe, (26m) and his wife now have 5 kids. Joe moved 3 states away when he was 18 and just recently moved his family back to live with his father. Before they moved back, they were mostly homeless, going between public housing and motels. After their 1st child, they cut off our family after no 9ne could keep sending them money. They were convinced that we were all rich and were punishing Joe for moving. We were not, I was working a minimum wage job while in college while caring for my child, grandma is on ss, his dad was on disability, my mom works as a can and my dad is 9n disability. We weren't punishing, we were all just barely getting by.

Here recently after Joe moved back, he started throwing a fit that no one wanted to constantly watch his kids so they could get a break(every other day). He got Angier and angrier when he would see my son with my parents and grandma constantly. I tried to explain that it's because we live next door and my son is older and more independent(true but also his kids are out of control and no one can handle them). He finally lost it on my parents and grandma that they were showing favoritism with the grandkids. I finally snapped back that my son is the favorite for q reason.. I told him that no one had any responsibility when it came to his kids and if he wanted them to have a close relationship with everyone, he needed to make an effort and not cut everyone off when he was throwing a tantrum.

Our family is now torn on who was right or wrong. Grandma says I should have never said my son was the favorite and it wasn't my place to speak up. I feel like I'm in the wrong because I understand where my grandma is coming from. 

AITA?

Some context: my (32M) parents are immigrants turned US citizens. They emigrated to the US in 2000 when I was 12 and my sister (22F) was 2. I'll save you the whole story but its basically the generic ""came from nothing"" success story. My father used to be a janitor and my mother a house maid. Now my father is upper management in a tech company and my mother an engineer. Together they make around 500k/yr. 

Because of this rapid success, my childhood was quite different from my sister's. I grew up having bread and butter for dinner, having to buy my own car in high school (+ insurance, gas, maintenance), and luxuries like a gaming console I had to save up my allowance for months on end to buy. My sister on the other hand, has almost absolutely everything handed to her. She got my father's old car once she went to college. He pays for the gas/insurance/maintenance. She wants expensive things for her birthday? No problem!

Don't get me wrong though, I love my sister. She's incredibly bright and talented, a straight A university student and an extremely talented artist. She also has a budding professional athletic career. The one thing is, she can't hold a job. Her excuse is that she doesn’t have time for one because of her university studies. Because of this, she's incredibly dependent on my parents financially. They pay for her rent (though she has chipped in here and there), her insurance, gas, pretty much everything. I'm pretty sure my parents even gave her a credit card attached to their account that she can use on whatever. To say I'm a little envious is an understatement.

Now finally to the issue: My parents recently came to me about their will. They said that I get to choose whether or not to receive their house or leave it for my sister. Thing is, I myself am very well off financially and I'm already a homeowner (though my parents' house is significantly bigger and nicer). I know that once my parents pass away my sister will no longer have the financial support she needs and will likely end up homeless since she will no longer be able to afford her apartment. I don't want this to happen to her, but at the same time I feel like I finally have an opportunity to get something nice from mom and dad for a change. I'm conflicted.

TL;DR My sister is financially dependent on my parents and I fear taking my parents house after they pass will leave her homeless, but at the same time I feel like I deserve it.

I'm assuming if I take the house they will give the remainder of their money to my sister, but I know for a fact their house will be worth much, much more than that.

However, I still searched for scholarships to at least ease some of the burden from my parents, while my sister doesn't even bother. I make around 180k/yr and my sister still hasn't started looking for job opportunities or internships. To be frank, I'm really worried for her. She's like a trust fund kid without the trust fund.
