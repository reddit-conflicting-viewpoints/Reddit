sowqax,Wondering if such a thing exists as a supply chain dependency visualizer,68,0.9,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/sowqax/wondering_if_such_a_thing_exists_as_a_supply/,37,"I've been musing on a thought lately: ""everything working depends on everything working"". But considering this, it seems that it isn't quite true. Some systems are more resilient and either have more redundant, swap-able inputs, or rely on more robust inputs. And some things are more delicate and require greater webs of systems to function. 

I'm imagining a chart, or a map, or some kind of representation of the interdependencies where you can visualize the degree of dependency of one system on another.

For example you could select semiconductors, and it would highlight the industries that rely on them and the relative degree to which they rely on them. Or you could toggle a switch and see the things that the semiconductor industry relies on and so forth. 

Or take a car. The metal can be sourced from mines all over the world. The transmissions can be made in a handful of factories. The semiconductors all come from TSMC. So you could give this car a resiliency rating, based on the resilience of its dependencies. 


Of course this quickly gets extremely complicated due to the recursive dependencies. But I wonder if there isn't some limit that you can approach where modeling this gives you a basic rough idea of the general anatomy of the global supply chain and its main limbs and interconnections. This is the sort of thing I would picture some CIA analyst manipulating on a clear glass screen deep in some fusion hub in a Tom Cruise movie. I would think there has to be some version of this somewhere..

Or maybe the software is just the minds of those capable of imagining and comprehending all of these relationships?",1644464957.0

soisau,Turkish Influence in Central Asia,101,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/soisau/turkish_influence_in_central_asia/,9,"Turkey spent much of the 20th century building itself back up after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, striving to become the major power at the world's crossroads once again. Turkey's influence now extends wider than it has in decades, from the battlefields of North Africa to the slopes of the Caucasus, to the supply chains of Europe, and into the frontlines of Syria. In the country's pursuit of regional power however, there remains one more front they are still yet to gain deep influence in: Central Asia. 4 of the 5 former Soviet Central Asian republics have a Turkic background, and are striving to diversify their trading partnerships, but does Turkey actually stand a chance of being able to pull any of these republics away from the gravitational pull of Russia and China?

Many would argue that Turkey and its politicians desire to live up to a historical regional legacy, and this can be seen through the country’s efforts to gain influence in a number of its neighbouring regions. Most obvious is its involvement in the Middle East, where it has played a role in the Syrian conflict in particular over the last decade, cementing its role as a regional power who must be at the table for future decisions. This model of intervention has played out somewhat successfully for Ankara in both Nagorno-Karabakh, Libya, Somalia and in Syria, and is looking like a possible model to be refined in their other neighbouring regions, including North Africa, South-Eastern Europe, the Caucuses, and Central Asia.

To quickly look at North Africa for context, Turkey has been a large presence in the Libyan civil war, with its drones and mercenaries being instrumental in a number of key battles throughout the country, even on occasion going head-to-head with Russia’s own proxies and drones. In Southeast Europe, their primary focus has recently been on Ukraine, with Ankara being very outspoken against Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, and rapidly expanding the scope of its relationship with Kyiv. This has included limited defence cooperation, where the two are working together on naval construction and some aspects of operations, as well as aviation engineering, and critically, Turkey’s drone program. In the Caucuses again Turkey’s drones were immensely powerful in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the relationship between Ankara and Baku is extremely strong.

So where does Turkey’s interest in Central Asia come from, and what role is it trying to carve out for itself in a region dominated by Russia culturally, and China economically? A number of the experts we interviewed for the piece seem to pinpoint its origins at Turkeys snubbing by the EU, and their failure to meaningfully advance toward EU membership or closer ties with the European Union in the early 2000’s, with this snubbing becoming the major catalyst for the countries decision to pivot away from Europe and toward the Middle East and Africa. With the roads into Europe becoming increasingly stonewalled by the EU, Erdogan seems to be throwing his weight behind the countries “*Look East* “ doctrine. This change in national doctrine precipitated Turkey’s increased roles to its South and East, and brings us to where we are today.

Ankara is hoping to use its Turkic cultural connections as a conversation starter to begin relationships with a number of these Central Asian republics, and possibly act as the republics gateways into Europe for the sale of their vast energy resources. For this reason, Matthew Bryza argues that there is nostalgia and cultural influence in its decision to try and establish itself in Central Asia, but underneath that is increasingly economically unstable Anakra desperate for additional revenue streams.

It should be said though that when travelling through this region of the world it is still incredibly evident that Moscow's roots are still embedded deep into the ground, and Russian is still the Lingua Franca of the region. Poll after poll in the majority of the Central Asian populations shows a preference toward Moscow over Beijing, even though China regularly outspends Russia in parts of the region. Ankara is hoping this penchant for cultural affinity over economic stability could work in Turkey’s favour and act as a future blueprint for improving its ties with the regions inhabitants.

Although still below a majority, Russia and China have seen a slightly growing populist opposition to them in the Central Asian states in recent years, and Bruce Pannier argues that Turkey could sidestep this opposition because of the historical and cultural connections that it has in the region. As such, Turkey aims to either create a role just for itself, or work with Russia and/or China on projects to be the more acceptable face of various efforts to increase influence in the region. Ankara is well aware of its minor economic weight compared to Moscow and China, but there is hope in the Turkish foreign policy circles that the country could gain enough influence to become the balance of power in the region, encouraging Bejiing and Moscow to cooperate with Ankara to maintain stability in Central Asia.

Despite this, Russia’s influence should not be underestimated, and while Turkey’s military export business is strong, Russia is a step above and will remain critical for regional security, especially following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Turkey though is trying to make inroads in the regions arms industry, and just in recent months we have been seeing a step up in Turkeys sales of drones to Krygyzstan, and the deploying of military advisors into the country. Last April we saw conflict break out in the border areas between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, leaving around 50 dead. The same area along the border is now heating up again, with Kyrgyz nationalists renaming ethnicly Tajik towns to Krygyz names in a direct provocation of the Tajik population. Some analysts in the region worry that Turkey may look to support Bishkek in a similar way it assisted Azerbaijan in the Karabakh conflict, something almost everyone agrees was largely responsible for the Azeri victory in the war. Turkish influence here in Central Asia though risks the conflict widening and drawing other regional players like Iran, China and Russia in, so Ankara is being warned to proceed with caution in its dealings with Kyrgyzstan. Because of this, Turkey’s growing roles in its many neighbouring regions will be important to keep an eye on going forward, as they have the potential to be very influential military, politically, and even economically.Turkey still has a long way to go before it can ever hope to legitimately muscle out Russian or Chinese influence in these countries, but I also think they are an entity in the region that should be watched carefully. If there is a conflict on the Tajik border, and Turkey does play a major role, or Turkey builds the pipeline infrastructure to connect the Turkmen gas fields to the European markets across the Caspian, or they simply provide major funding for Turkic nationalist candidates in some elections, Ankara may actually be on its way to the long shot of becoming the balance of power between Russia and China in the region.I would love to get this subs thoughts on the subject though.

Will Turkey move to militarily back Krygyzstan in the event of another war with Tajikistan?Will Ankara have the finances to build meaningful infrastructure in the area, or are they already vastly overstretched? And with Turkey now prosecuting Turkmen activists protesting in Istanbul, will be see backlash against Ankara from the general populations of these countries?If youre interested in checking out the full piece on *“Turkish influence in Central Asia”* we put together a fortnight ago withALEX KOKCHAROV >> Principal Research Analyst at IHS Markit, and a specialising in Ukraine, Russia, and the former Soviet States

**Abstract.** Russia’s president Putin lies at the center of the potential conflict, and the decision to initiate a conflict would likely be his to make. The calculus of the decision, while multi-variable, is conversely somewhat simple. On the one hand, Putin has the opportunity to remove a belligerent state whose shift towards integration within the EU provides an existential threat to Putin’s regime. This opportunity must be weighed against the cost of the West’s response and the risk of a western intervention. Because while the 2009 reforms sharpened the edge of Russia’s military, the vast bulk is still comprised of Soviet era technology; technology certainly capable of providing weight to a conflict with a similarly equipped Ukrainian force but unlikely to match against a near-peer force like NATO.^[1](https://icds.ee/en/the-main-developments-in-russian-military-capability/)[2](https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2020/10/russia-armed-forces)

**Background.** To avoid an intervention, Putin must do what Putin does best: maskirovska, the ability to make something that is look like something that isn’t. Putin’s regime began with the 1999 Apartment Bombings, a terrorist attack of questionable origins[3](https://www.rferl.org/amp/putin-russia-president-1999-chechnya-apartment-bombings/30097551.html)[4](https://www.hudson.org/research/12750-vladimir-putin-1999-russian-apartment-house-bombings-was-putin-responsible) that provided a pretext for the Second Chechen War. The successful handling of this war as prime minister solidified Putin as the strong leadership Russia lacked throughout the 1990s and vaulted him to the presidency.[5](https://www.gq.com/story/moscow-bombings-mikhail-trepashkin-and-putin/amp)

Nine years later, Georgia and Russia go to war over the breakaway states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. While the root causes of the war are difficult to parse[6](https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-august-war-ten-years-on-a-retrospective-on-the-russo-georgian-war/); the end result of the war is not.[7](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/RL34618.pdf) Russia, exceedingly well prepared for the conflict, overwhelmed Georgia’s military in less than two weeks, Russian peacekeepers remain stationed in the breakaway states largely run as de facto Russian territory, and Georgian aspirations for NATO integration appear on life support. Occurring during the peak of the 2008 Financial Crisis and two months before the US Presidential Election, western responses were limited.[8](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/the-2008-russo-georgian-war-putins-green-light)

Euromaidan in late 2013 saw Ukraine coalesce as a nation pivoting towards the EU and NATO.[9](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/the-significance-euromaidan-for-ukraine-and-europe) Three months later, the infamous little green men appear in Crimea[10](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26532154). The stateless nature of the forces and ongoing pro-Russian protests provided sufficient cover for Putin to claim Crimean self-determination of its status.[11](https://www.zaoerv.de/75_2015/75_2015_1_a_101_118.pdf) [12](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40802-015-0043-9.pdf) Subsequently similar if slightly less successful operations in Donetsk and Luhansk devolved into the ongoing War in the Donbas. Again, Putin provided just enough confusion to paralyze a western response and destabilize a neighbor’s entry into NATO.[13](https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/research_papers/2019RP05_fhs.pdf)

**Today.** Clearly, no one should underestimate Putin’s ability to fabricate a casus belli or to foster discord in the West and paralyze any response. The operational deployment of Russian forces provides Putin the capability to take advantage of any opportunity that may present itself. The short term objective for Putin of regime change in Kiev could be accomplished with a short, decisive offensive in concert with civil unrest fostered from Moscow.[14](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-possible-invasion-ukraine) Although the Ukraine of today has a mostly modern road system, Putin still likely respects the impact rasputitsa can have on offensive operations. Thus, any conflict will likely occur before the spring melt. This coincides with European usage of Russian gas, the greatest leverage Putin has to directly impact a potential Western response.[15](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/how-europe-has-become-so-dependent-on-putin-for-gas-quicktake) [16](https://www.marshallcenter.org/de/node/1276)

Ultimately, Putin’s decision hinges on his risk tolerance and what response he believes the West, largely led by the U.S. and specifically President Biden, can mount. If Putin can present the conflict as a Russian response to some incident at the border or within Ukraine itself, he can potentially freeze the Western response. If timed with a particularly brutal cold snap when Europe and particularly Germany are burning Russian gas to stay warm, it could allow just enough time for “Ukrainian self-determination” to be influenced back in Moscow's direction.

To Putin, the West could take whatever pretense for the conflict at face value as they did in Georgia in 2008 and accept the fait accompli in Ukraine as they did in Crimea in 2014. Putin’s regime removes a potential threat in Kiev but perhaps more importantly, demonstrates that the international order championed by the West and illustrated by NATO is not so much incapable as unwilling to stand by the concept that force is no longer an acceptable tool of policy. That the world won’t protect smaller nations from the wolves in the night and instead strength, and particularly the willingness to use it, will be the international norm of the 21st Century.

This is Putin’s gamble. Far from reckless, Putin has demonstrated a cunning willingness to take advantage of whatever opportunity presents itself to reestablish Russia as a major geopolitical player and destabilize potential threats on the federation’s borders. These actions demonstrate the strength of Russia (and by extension, Putin’s government) to both a domestic and international audience and provide sufficient legitimacy to continue plundering the nations wealth for his own (and other oligarch's) personal gain.

**Future.** So what should be the West’s response? The first answer is exactly what it is doing. Preemptive unmasking of the disinformation that Putin used to cover his actions. A concerted and coordinated response to any military action becomes more certain the less maskirovska he is able to put in place.

The second, and most likely course of action, are sanctions. While certainly providing an impact on the Russian economy (and thus Putin’s personal wealth), sanctions could be viewed by Putin as a cost of doing business. Moreover, continued use of sanctions only push the Russian economy further away from the West. Thus, while a factor, sanctions are unlikely to ultimately play a key role in Putin’s decision and may be counterproductive for the West in the long term.

The third response, and the most unlikely, would be a soft military intervention of peacekeepers at the onset of hostilities. A resolution through the UN for a peacekeeping force would likely be welcomed by Ukraine and could allow time to defuse any casus belli. While a textbook application of the overall mission of the UN, Russia (and possibly China’s) position on the security council almost guarantee a veto. Even still, quick presentation of a proposal (and resulting veto) would force Russia to crystallize their position to the international community that peace in Ukraine would be on Russian terms only.

Finally, and of most concern to Putin, would be a coordinated and concerted international military response. Putin may gamble that the West’s (both domestic US and intra-alliance) discord will give him time. He may gamble reliance on Russian gas or lack of a formal security guarantee with Ukraine will prompt Germans and other Europeans to collectively shrug. Most importantly, he may gamble Biden can’t provide the leadership to assemble a coalition of international consensus against his actions. He could argue (not without merit), that US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan constituted similar regime changes.

Thus, Ukraine provides a litmus test for the current international system. Biden’s greatest challenge will be convincing the world that previous American policy mistakes should not engender future Russian ones. If the world no longer treats armed conflict as a means of settling territorial disputes, frozen conflicts in Taiwan, Siachen, Ethiopia, or the Balkans may no longer be restrained. If Putin gets a cold snap in Ukraine, the ensuing conflict could drag everyone into a world full of wolves.",1643401432.0

I'm even more puzzled following Trump's emphasis on the Wall and, before that, the EU's refugee crises.  

I move on to bafflement given what a vested interest any military has in diverse, resilient, and sustainable supply lines, a pacified populace that sustain a long slog, and how much potential cross over there is in a lot of green tech and military applications (portable solar,  distribute and automated food production/water desalination, batteries, etc.)

Skyrocketing temperatures, flooding, loss of arable land, water, etc. and accompanying chaos are likely inevitable and yet it seems to me that very few nations are pre-building capacities to either ward off popular uprisings, prepare for their neighbors collapse and flood of refugees, seize territory en mass? 

What about the ability to potentially weaponize climate change or, conversely, prepare to try and alter the temperature while sustaining global pushback?  

There's quite a bit that's possible, especially for ambitious autocrats, to prepare for that would allow them to exploit the chaos.  

And yes, aside from Russia taking a pretty good look at the north pole, I can't think of anyone pushing this?  

So, why aren't the militaries pushing this?

>according to Haaretz, Haftar has promised that he would launch a recognition process akin to that carried out by the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco last year, in exchange for ""military and diplomatic assistance"" from Israel.

Most major powers have already begun their pivot to Asia, and now Russia is scrambling to reassert itself into the struggle unfolding right in its own backyard. Will Russia be able to become a regional leader, or will they be forced to take a back seat to an ascendant China in this theatre? 

With its heartland west of the Ural Mountains, Russia has long been tightly Europe-focused; but as geopolitical focal points continue to move toward the Indo-Pacific, Moscow is forced to pay attention to its long-neglected far eastern regions. These regions have seen little to no investment since some way into the Soviet Era, and aside from hosting Russia’s nuclear-armed submarine fleet in Vladivostok, the far-east has been of diminished military relevance to the leadership in Moscow since much of Nuclear forces were redeployed to Kola.   
At present Vladivostok is a 6-7 day train ride from the heartland, making any deployments or logistics networks extremely challenging, raising old anxieties in the Kremlin about an inability to control its furthest regions in the event of an invasion or uprising. The Russian *Vostok* exercises were somewhat successful in proving Russia could rapidly deploy forces to the Pacific, but still left a lot to desire in the minds of Kremlin planners. The exercises were in perfect conditions, with time to prepare and even then the rapid deployment was less than smooth. The Russian forces have been a predominately Western focused force, and that stokes fears that the Russian forces are lagging increasing behind in logistical capabilities as the Pacific front continues to gain importance.   

To try and combat this Putin set in motion his own Pivot to Asia a few years ago, which outlined plans to improve infrastructure & investment in the region, and to substantially increase the military capacity in the Russian far-east. Little of this has come to pass though, and much of the infrastructure in Kamchatka is in worse shape than when the plan was first proposed. 

This issue goes beyond just infrastructure though, as this lack of refurbishing and reinvesting is also rampant in Russian surface fleets. With 5 fleets to modernise, Russia’s Pacific fleet has taken a back seat to its Baltic, Northern, and even Black Sea fleets meaning that Vladivostok continues to receive the Russian navies leftovers.  Although the state has more military capacity than its economy would indicate, it is still severely hampered, and cannot improve everywhere all at once with its limited resources. 

So where have incremental economic improvements to the Russian Pacific theatre come from? Well, largely from China. Russian border towns have seen massive economic and population growth over the past few decades, where in the space of a couple of decades Chinese fishing villages across the river have turned into massive metropolitan areas. Chinese investment in transport lines and economic development have seen benefits in these border regions, and subsidised Russia’s own limited capacity to do so; although with this comes the additional effect of challenging Russia’s hegemony in the region. 

With an ascendant China in the region though is Russia being delegated to a junior partner? We certainly have seen a good deal of joint exercises between Russian forces and the PLA and PLAN, and in those operations Russia has largely taken a backseat to China in regional issues, such as Korea. The caveat being that these operations are against mutually beneficial adversaries, and we still haven’t seen what would happen if China and Russia were to compete over something, as opposed to the operation being mutually beneficial. The closeness of the Russia-China relationship is borne out of a combination of mutual interest and required respect, rather than a deep intertwining of commands. For the time being the two seem to align on most international diplomatic issues in this theatre, and thus will likely continue to work together until their paths are forced to deviate. 

The question I would ask this sub is what do you think it would take for Moscow to place the Pacific front on the same priority level as the Northern or Black Sea fronts, and how would Moscow react to a conflict in the South China sea?   
My gut feeling is that Russia would assist China with intelligence and logistics, but would do what they could to stay out of it to avoid escalation in Europe? I am keen to get this subs thoughts though.

This placed a significant financial strain on all but the most powerful states, when a large amount of troops had to be raised and sustained during great confrontations like the Punic Wars, Arab–Byzantine Wars, Ottoman–Habsburg Wars or Seven Years' War. The Levée en masse implemented in the Napoleonic Wars is a general draft that came to be used even in peace time by almost every industrialized nation until the late 20th century, it allowed rapid replacement of losses as well as the fielding of much larger armies that directly led to the shockingly high casualty rates of the World Wars. The United States was one of the first countries to suspend conscription in 1973, mostly because of political pressure rather than some strategic imperative to reduce overall strength by over a third at nearly the same point that Soviet conventional forces were actually expanding. Today China and India actually have a glut of citizens willing to serve, but maintaining force levels is proving to be quite a challenge for other fully professional militaries, an issue that constant improvement in compensation and benefits appears unable to address. The de facto mixed system currently employed by many military powers such as Russia, Turkey, Iran, Thailand, Brazil, Ukraine and Israel sets the required number of troops every year, then the shortfall in volunteers is offset with well-trained though modestly paid conscripts, the idea being that this keeps personnel costs down and frees up a higher percentage of the defense budget for procuring equipment and maintaining infrastructure.",1641149614.0

**The geographical location of the disputed island**

The contested islets and rocks are located at about 170 km northwest of Japan's Ishigaki Island/Okinawa Prefecture, at approximately 170 km northeast of Taiwan, and roughly 330 km off the coast of mainland China. They have a total area of 6.3 km^(2) and consist of five volcanic islets and three barren rocky outcrops. Their geological characteristics are distinct from those located in the South China Sea. The biggest islet, Uotsuri Island, is the only 'island', sustaining a Japanese population engaged in economic activity until the 1930s.

**Republic Of China's claim over Diaoyutai**

According to the ROC, China discovered the Diaoyutai Islands in 1372 during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and since then, the Chinese people have been closely linked to them. The areas surrounding the islands had been repeatedly referred to as part of Chinese history since 1534. Chinese envoys at the time used the islands as a navigation post en route to the Ryūkyū Kingdom (now Okinawa). Furthermore, According to ROC Foreign Minister David Lin, “The most authoritative historical records supporting the Chinese claim are envoy mission records and official Taiwan gazetteers published during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912).”

Due to its diplomatic isolation, Taipei's voice is often ignored, even though it is a claimant state in both the East and South China Seas. However, ROC claims that the islands form an inherent territory of Taiwan based on the islands geographical location, geological structure, historical evidence, usage, and international law.However, in recent years, Taipei was able to score some gains by using a two-pronged strategy.

On the “soft” side, President Ma Ying-jeou in August 2012 proposed an East China Sea Peace Initiative (ECSPI) calling on all parties to,

* Restrain from taking any antagonistic actions,
* Shelve controversies and not abandon dialogue, (3) observe international law and resolve disputes through peaceful means,
* Seek consensus on a code of conduct in the East China Sea, and
* Establish a mechanism for cooperation on exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea

Implementation guidelines soon followed, Calling for a two-stage implementation:

* Peaceful dialogue and mutually reciprocal negotiation and
* Sharing resources and cooperative development. 

On the ""hard"" side, soon after Japan’s nationalization announcement, Taipei blessed some activists seeking to land on those disputed islands and at one point even dispatched its Coast Guard ships to shoot water cannons at Japanese patrol ships. Taiwan’s assertive behaviour caught many observers by surprise and raised the spectre of a tacit collaboration between Taiwan and China, despite the ROC’s repeated denial.

Perhaps to head off possible China-Taiwan collusion and with US nudging, Japan signed a fishery agreement with Taiwan in April 2013— the first concession over the island quarrel after seventeen futile previous rounds of negotiation. Taiwanese boats can now operate freely in a 7,400-square-kilometer area around these islands.

**Conflicting sovereignty claims to the disputed islands**

While PRC/ROC share the narrative which is built on historic evidence substantiating its claim of having first discovered the islands in 1372 under the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and of the islands have been an 'inherent part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

The narrative defended by Japan, which currently has administrative control over the islands, is based on the acquisition of ownership through discovery and occupation. Japan has consistently denied that there is a sovereignty dispute in the first place. According to Japan's official position, Tatsushiro Koga, a Japanese businessman, explored the islands in 1884 and leased four of them from 1896 after Japan had carried out on-site field surveys, in line with procedures set out in international law.

Japan incorporated the island into Okinawa Prefecture in 1895, during the Sino-Japanese War a few months prior to the Treaty of Shimonoseki by China and Japan in April 1985. Under this treaty, China ceded to Japan 'the island of Formosa (Taiwan), together with all islands appertaining or belonging to the said island of Formosa, as well as the Penghu Islands. The eight islets and rocks are not mentioned. The PRC, however, asserts that they were among the territory ceded to Japan, while Japan claims that they were already Japanese territory.

The PRC and Taiwan have argued that the islands should have been returned to China under the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, following Japan's unconditional surrender after World War II. Under the Potsdam Declaration 'Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine'. The Japanese position, however, states that Article 3 of the 1951 San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan provides 'that the Nansei Shoto Islands be placed under the administrative authority of the US'. It also states that at that time, the Senkaku Islands were included in the Nansei Shoto Islands and thus remained as part of Japanese territory.

**Gradual militarisation of the sovereignty dispute**

Prior to 2010, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands were a relatively peripheral issue in Sino-Japanese relations.

* **September 7, 2010**A Chinese fishing trawler collided with Japanese Coast Guard ships in the waters surrounding the islands, resulting in the Japanese detention of the ship and crew and the arrest of the captain. This spiralled into a major diplomatic incident, as Beijing applied increasing pressure on Japan for their return. Japan first released the ship and crew, and then eventually also the captain, after which tensions subsided.
* **2012, Nationalization of the disputed Island**The Japanese government chose to preempt an initiative by the nationalist mayor of Tokyo to buy several of the islands from a private owner by purchasing the islands themselves. This unleashed a new round of conflict involving popular protests and official tensions. The 2010 collision and subsequent 2012 purchase were thus decisive turning points in the nature of the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. 

Since late 2010 the islands have increased in significance as a symbol, as a domestic political football, and as an object of ongoing, competitive jockeying. The islands became increasingly salient as a domestic political issue in no small part because of their growing symbolic significance. But at the same time, the symbolic import of the islands benefitted immensely from being championed by domestic politicians, activists, and others who latched onto the issue, whether opportunistically or out of sincere conviction. As the islands’ symbolic and domestic political importance rose, so too did the respective pressures on the leaders managing the contest to take stronger action. This set in motion competitive spirals of move and counter-move between Tokyo and Beijing.

**The PRC's strategy of eroding Japan's administrative control**

Japan's 2020 defence white paper states that the PRC has 'relentlessly continued attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in the sea area around the Senkaku Islands. Since Japan's acquisition of three of the disputed islands from a private Japanese landowner in September 2012, the PRC has adopted a more offensive strategy, involving the deployment of 'grey-zone operations' aimed at gradually and incrementally challenging Japan's administrative control over the contested islands and generating 'proof' of the PRC's administrative control by means of sub-threshold coercion, without triggering an armed conflict. These operations are mainly performed by the China Cost Guard (CCG) and the maritime militia, with the PLAN remaining in the background to make operations look like pure civil law enforcement activities.

In September 2012 the CCG abruptly changed its operational pattern by significantly stepping up the number of its vessels present not only in the contiguous zone of 24 nm but also in the territorial sea of 12 nm around the contested islands. The increased presence of CCG vessels since 2012 did not come as a short flare-up as was the case in the wake of the 2010 trawler incident. Rather the increasingly frequent and longer presence of the CCG in the maritime zones around the disputed islands has become a constant feature of what researchers have referred to as the first phase in a three-phased strategy of coercive grey-zone operations. The second phase of the strategy, i.e. overlapping administrative control, would be the PRC's exercise of law enforcement rights in these maritime zones in parallel to Japan.

**US Position**

Since 1972, the US has held a neutral position on the sovereignty of the disputed islands. However, in the 1990s the US started to confirm that they are covered by Article 5 of the US-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security as Japanese-administered territory. In 2014, former President Barack Obama made an oral US defence commitment in favour of the disputed islands in the event of their attack. In 2017, former President Donald Trump reaffirmed this US commitment in ajoint written declaration with then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Following this, the US Air Force and the Japan Air Self-Defence Force (JASDF) held joint training flights near the disputed islands.

But what if these aren't the best options? Ignoring Ukraine for the moment, what if it is better to let China have Taiwan and then fight on terms better suited to the USA and its allies?

To defend Taiwan would mean putting a lot of US assets into danger - major fleet units would need to sail within range of shore-based aircraft and terminally-guided IRBMs, USMC ships would be even more vulnerable and any fight would be in contested airspace. China's huge SSK fleet is designed to fight in the Straits as are its short-range assets.

Would it not be better to trade 'space for time' as NATO planned to do in a war against the WP? This would enable the USA to utilise its force multipliers without keeping one eye on the clock. The Chinese invasion fleet is a one-shot weapon. It will suffer massive attrition from ROC defences alone, without outside assistance, and the people of Taiwan will not meekly submit to the CCP. The PLA can look forward to constant attrition and civil disobedience.

In the meantime, the US and allies can just pick off the Chinese multipliers one at a time until the PLA is a shadow of its former self and most of the Straits are covered in shipwrecks and splashed aircraft. Until national infrastructure (much less robust than that in the west) is collapsing and sanctions, combined with destruction/surrender of Chinese O/S assets (Gwadar, Trincomalee) are driving China towards starvation and economic collapse with no fuel for their military, no food or power for their people and an increasingly disruptive populace.

Surely this is better than fighting the enemy on a battlefield of his choosing at a time of his choosing?

EDIT 1. Thanks for the awards. I think this post has done its job of stimulating discussion of the matter.

EDIT 2. There seem to be a lot of commenters mistakenly thinking that I'm advocating the abandonment of Japan, ROC and ROK. This is not the case. These nations may suffer short-term pain from a lack of US 'boots on the ground' (or, more accurately, carriers nearby), but their survival depends on the ability of the US to project power, a power I believe will be severely attrited if it attempts to fight the long war on Chinese terms. I am exploring an alternative to the current narrative with the same goal of preserving the independence of Japan and ROK, the de facto independence of Taiwan and the elimination of the PLA threat to Taiwan and the SCS island groups..",1641083290.0

Considering this, what do you think would be the implications of said Council coming to fruition and being a success? How would this affect, respectively, Chinese and Western plans for Latin America? How would each great power react?

In my opinion, the biggest actor harmed by this would be the US, considering any type of military arrangement between Latin American nations necessarily has the goal of counterbalancing the overwhelming North American hegemony in the Americas.

So there's been a lot of talk of war with China over Taiwan, most of it focusing on how to fight the war and how likely will Taiwan + US win. What I haven't seen a lot of is whether US will actually go to war with China. 

From what I can see: 

1. Taiwan is not in US backyard, there isn't much in US's core strategic interest to fight China over Taiwan. (Freedom of navigation in SCS is important but not CORE interest)

2. It's not gonna be an easy fight, nuclear or not. Conventionally, the logistics to move enough materiel to fight in West Pacific is very expensive. And with Chinese A2/AD capabilities, it's not gonna be a walkover like desert storm. 

3. Will US citizens support an expensive (in both treasure and American lives terms) war with China? The last time Japan tried to be a hegemon in West Pacific, there was serious consideration under War Plan Orange to not get embroiled in war, had Japan not bombed Pearl Harbour. I mean, it's easy to talk and say yeah kill the Chinese and sit on their skulls, but is the average American citizen okay with sending their loved ones to fight China over Taiwan?

**Edit: Wow. This is actually my first time posting on Reddit. I'm amazed by the range and quality of responses and have tried to read through all of them. A few key points I keep seeing pop up, so I thought I'll do a bit of clarification here.

A. Let's assume the timeline isn't tight. Of course right now its impossible for war, if only because military buildup takes time (for all parties involved). But I guess what I'm asking is more general. Say, over the next 20 years, given current trends, what are the likelihoods of war with China?

B. For those who say the Chinese military is a paper tiger, I think its hardly grounded in reality? I mean, Sec Def recently labelled China as a ""pacing challenge"". A kind of benchmark you measure your own military progress on. And even if right now PLAN is no match for the 11 CVBG the US has, they are building up capability at an incredible rate. A new ship being commissioned every month + a Carrier that is at least on par with Kitty Hawk (maybe even Nimitz without the nuclear propulsion) with some EMALS thrown in is scheduled to be commissioned early 2022. China only commissioned her first carrier in 2012, and she's not that far behind US already, tech wise. And that's not including the rapidly expanding hypersonic anti-ship missile arsenal to keep the USN at maximum range. All this to say, US will be fighting a near-peer competitor, and I wonder what's the appetite for such a fight? Because sure as hell, it will be a war of attrition.

C. Playing the devil's advocate here, those who mention that the US is unlikely to go to war and instead just sanction China, how effective will those sanctions be? China is not like Iran, and economic sanctions affect it wayyyyy less. In fact, if we look at the trends for the last 30 years, China's dependence on FDI has dropped from 6% in the 1990s to right now 1% of GDP. https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/CHN/china/foreign-direct-investment. Export as % of GDP has also dropped significantly from 30% to now hovering around 15%. Of this 15%, US comprises roughly 17.5% of Chinese exports) 
And also, that's what the Belt and Road is for. It's a precursor to a new global institution based on Chinese rules, using a digital yuan that is free from US influence, so that China can break out of US encirclement in the economic sphere. 

D. EU is largely NATO, but has different policy concerns as US, and will not always follow US in policy. (I mean, just look at France breaking away from AUKUS Olympic boycott) We tend to think of EU being US's wingman, but when it comes down to it, if said policy doesn't align with EU's interest, they will walk away. Yes, it IS in EU interest to maintain FoN in SCS because according to UNCTAD, at least 30% of world trade flows through there. HOWEVER, the only reason why EU has trade flowing through there is because it is primarily trading with China (rest of SEA account for very little trade by % of EU). EU is already bristling with Russia, and to be able to exert maximum pressure, it can't afford to also open another economic rift with China. Getting EU buy-in to a broader war with China over Taiwan seems really difficult. And then there's S.Korea. S.Korea has been taking a very conciliatory approach towards China, once again for economic reasons, and that China is so near to it. AFAIK, the military alliance between S.Korea/Japan and US is of a defensive nature, i.e. they're not obligated to declare war if they are not personally invaded. Japan is facing a population crunch already (decades ahead of China), and its just really bad policy to send your remaining young people to war. 

E. Getting Taiwan = getting dominance over Westpac. This part I have some difficulty following. Some comments mention that if China manages to take Taiwan, China will get dominance over Westpac. I mean, isn't there Guam, Wake Islands, Haiwaii further west, and then NZ and AUS, not to mention Japan and the 2nd island chain? 

F. Regarding strategic importance of SCS. From what I understand, US's interest in maintaining FoN in SCS lies primarily in trade (correct me if im wrong). US would lose out a chunk if China achieves hegemonic status in SEA, but in the grand scheme of things, its not something that will cripple US. I mean, US's 3 largest trading partners excluding China are the EU, Mexico and Canada. SEA accounts for 6% of its world trade only.",1640189559.0

The even more extremist ISK has been mounting increased terrorist activity and is seeking to gain control. And conditions will likely get even worse. 

All international aid has been frozen. My hot take is that the US and intl. community may have to (unfortunately) work with the Taliban, to avoid an even worse and more costly humanitarian disaster. If the Taliban could agree to particular policy changes (such as rights of women to work and study, amnesty for previous government supporters, and international monitoring) then perhaps the US and allies could justify the distribution of aid, resources, and some recognition. This is a humanitarian disaster that will only get worse. And what happens if ISK (ISIS) takes control? Then we will likely have to engage in another expensive and violent intervention in the future. We may strongly dislike the Taliban, but we have no power to affect change without engagement.

The new nation was pincered between France on its western flank and zarist Russia on its eastern flank. Russia today has the EU in the west and China in the east. 

Germany also had to face the British Empire, the global superpower. Today's Russia faces the USA. 

Germany was late in the colonial game, Russia is late in its modern version, the ""war on terror"" (Syria, Lybia).

Obviously, there are many differences as well. In particular, while Germany was the strongest nation, economically and militarily, the same cannot be said for today's Russia. Also, trade relations are different nowadays.

Nevertheless, I think one interesting conclusion from that comparison is that Germany fared well as long as it managed to avoid a Franco-Russian or Franco-British alliance. So Russia would do well to prevent alignment between China and the EU (and ideally China and the USA, but that's hardly necessary) but also, most importantly, NATO (the USA) and the EU. 

Could that current action in eastern Europe be understood as part of the latter strategic goal?  Is it possible that Putin is making offers directly to the USA in order to force a wedge between the EU and Washington? Could the long game be that NATO is replaced by the EU in eastern Europe because Putin sees the EU as much less dangerous?",1640161802.0

rgw8vt,Russian invasion to Ukraine. Russian opinion.,291,0.96,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rgw8vt/russian_invasion_to_ukraine_russian_opinion/,244,"I’m from Russia. I’m not a Putin paid troll, I’m actually an engineer. I also never voted for Putin and not going to cause I disagree with him on 2/3 of his internal policy. But this fact doesn’t mean that I can’t put myself in his shoes and guess what and why he’s doing. I also happen to watch American news sometimes and I haven’t seen there any explanation of this new crisis more sophisticated than “Putin is a dictator who wants to invade Ukraine for the sake of his self-esteem”. This situation forced me to write this post.

Let’s go back in time and remember Caribbean crisis. It all started with the United States deploying their intermediate range missiles in Turkey and the USSR replying with similar missiles in Cuba. For those people who never actually cared reding about missile types here is the shortest review ever:

Short-range ballistic missile: < 500km range.

Shorter-range ballistic missile: 500-1000km range.

Intermediate-range ballistic missile: 1000-5500km range.

Long-range ballistic missile: > 5500km range.

For obvious reasons, the shorter the range, the lower the price, which leads to deployment of intermediate (and shorter) range missiles to be pretty cheap which allows escalation to be fast and more dangerous. Ultimately this crisis lead to understanding of how dangerous this rocket spamming is and in 1987 the treaty was signed called Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which banned both Soviet Union and the US from deployment and development of shorter and intermediate range ballistic missiles. There are other treaties which were signed close to the end of Cold War such as New START, which reduced the quantity of nuclear devices in both countries, Treaty on Open Skies, which allows unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants, Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems and so on.

Those treaties lead us to this world we know where people don’t think of nuclear weapon much and war in general isn't somethink thought about often, at least in developed countries and many other places such as Russia or China. Ultimately, all those treaties created a balance where nor Russia nor the US can spam enough missiles to flood the world with them, can’t build a Missile Defense Systems large enough to counter those ballistic missiles which are still allowed for the other side and this guaranty mutual destruction in case of nuclear war. This measures also ensure that any nuclear strike if one is to happen anyway, leaves some time to talk it out while missiles are in flight (about 40 minutes). All of this prevents hot heads from actually wondering about what if… It’s mutual destruction. Period.

On December 13, 2001, George Bush announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems.

On August 2, 2019 Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

On November 22, 2020, Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on Open Skies.

Currently we only have New START left which was signed by Putin and Biden right after US elections left. So now there is nearly no obligations which prevent new Caribbean crisis from happening. And of course Putin is concerned about it. Now there are talks about Ukraine joining NATO. It’s just impossible for Russia to tolerate such thing because from Ukraine it’s less than 500km range to Moscow, cause the only way for Russia to enter the Atlantic ocean (nearly entire Russian trade goes there) is through Black See, and for many other reasons known in details to Russian military only.

During Caribbean crisis such threats to mutual safety lead to understanding of the danger by both sides, but now we don’t have such understanding. NATO is consuming ex-soviet countries, all the treaties ensuring mutual safety are being cancelled by the US and all concerns of Russia are ignored.

Let's suppose Mexico has joined a military alliance with China and is deploying chines military on the US boarder in 1 minute flight time from Washington. There won’t be any time to talk if missiles are launched, there won’t be any way to stop it in flight. There won’t be any defense from it which is economically possible. The idea that US government would say that it's fine, Mexico is a free country, we are fine with chineese missiles on our border is unbeliavable. And the Caribbean crisis is a proof of this.

Still Russian concerns are ignored. And this is why all of this war talks went this far. This invasion is actually possible in only one case: the case of NATO actually offering Ukraine to join, and Putin being left without a diplomatic solution of this. Nobody in Russia wants this conflict to happen, because what’s the point? American sanctions already decreased salary in dollars for people of Russia more than two times since 2014. Economical profit for Russia in case of invasion? None. Putin’s rating? It would fall cause people care about their salaries more than about anything else and nobody supports wars where you're actually supposed to fighn yourself and in case of this supposed war risks of mobilisation are pretty high. So there will be no Russian invasion unless NATO military are deployed there. And I really hope that americans are going to put yourself in our shoes and understand that US government went too far pretending Russia has no right to have any concerns about its safety while US are allowed to do anything not bothering to think about other countries interests.",1639564728.0

There aren’t many examples in the post-WW2 era where one state lost a war but continued in power, having signed a peace treaty where it ceded land to another. 

There are a few grey areas though, for example the most recent war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, however Armenia wasn’t ceding its own territory. Iraq annexed Kuwait in its entirety having deposed the government in 1990, so that’s not the same as what I’m asking either. Collapsing states like Yugoslavia in the 90s isn’t quite the same dynamic either. 

So, as a thought experiment, let’s imagine Russia invades Ukraine and scores a quick victory, capturing Kiev in a month. The Ukrainian government flees to Lviv, but soon signs a peace treaty ceding lands in southern and eastern Ukraine to Russia (this is only an example, the plausibility of this specific situation isn’t important to the broader question). The treaty is ratified by the Rada and the Duma.

re9zq7,The Choice Between US Green Energy and a Sovereign Ukraine,23,0.66,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/re9zq7/the_choice_between_us_green_energy_and_a/,46,"I think it is necessary to bring up the effect of the USA's choice under the Democrats to give up being a net energy exporter in order to be seen as more ""green"".

The USA under Trump was a net energy exporter, with a focus on increasing energy production.  This had certain geopolitical benefits, such as not being as reliant on the Middle East and OPEC for oil.  This aspect of US Domestic Energy policy, and the effects it directly has on US relationships with OPEC is fairly well understood.  But, the effects of this policy in the European and Asian theaters is often overlooked.

Because of Biden and the Democrats' decision to limit domestic energy production in the USA(which causally limits energy exports), the ability to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression has been massively limited.  And, Russia relatively has much greater power on the global stage(as well as OPEC).  Because the USA is an energy importer, it sucks energy from the global market, creating higher demand globally, including in Europe.  This causes Europe's reliance on Russia for gas to be elevated, and thus makes Europe less able/willing to oppose Russia in any meaningful way.

As of now, Biden's plan to defend Ukraine is to threaten Russia with Sanctions, and with a further buildup of Ukraine if there is in fact an invasion.  There are two main problems with this.

1.) Russia has Ukraine surrounded, with tons of troops and advanced weaponry which makes a ""blitzkreig"" like attack not only possible... but inevitable.  Russia could likely take over most of Ukraine fairly quickly.  So, threats of supplying Ukraine in the long term with more advanced weapons systems is moot to an extent... because Ukraine may not exist in the long term in any meaningful way.  And even with advanced weapons systems, it could very well be a case of ""too little, too late"".  At some point, if Ukraine loses 75% of its territory, and most of the economically/militarily viable land mass(much of which is in East Ukraine, where Russia could easily overtake it)... what is the point of expending so much resources to defend it?  

2.) When deterrence through economic sanctions is your main strategy(because as I said, the ""military"" deterrence of supplying a decimated Ukraine with advanced weapons systems AFTER Russia invades isn't very useful)... you have to be able to make Russia hurt enough that an invasion isn't worthwhile.  The problem is, Germany and EU hold the keys to a large part of the Russian economy.  Things like cutting Russia off from ""SWIFT"" sound scary, but Russia has been preparing for this eventuality for many years now, and has long known it was a possibility.  Decoupling Russia from SWIFT would hurt, but Russia has means of getting around it to some extent..  In reality, the only way to properly deter Russia from the massive gains it would get with an invasion of Ukraine would be through its core economic model of exporting energy to Europe and elsewhere.  But, Europe is in no position to ""hurt"" Russia in this way, to a large extent SPECIFICALLY because of US ""Green Energy"" policies of Democrats, which have put greater demand on energy globally.

This doesn't lay solely with the Democrats.  It lays in part on Germany(specifically Merkel) who chose to keep Russia as its energy source despite the USA attempting to instead become their supplier.  Germany, France, and much of the EU view the USA as an adversary similar to China/Russia.  Thus, they balked at the idea of paying more for US gas... because it would help their most powerful adversary, the USA.  The EU views the USA in some ways as a greater threat than Russia, who it sees as not economically capable of being a real threat to the EU(whereas USA/China are economically and militarily capable). 

So, to summarize... the west as a whole is in a much worse position to defend Ukraine, or punish Russia for an invasion due to Domestic Green Policies of Democrats.  Instead of the USA being in a position to aid Europe in making up for a shortfall of Gas/Oil imports from Russia... the USA itself cannot even support its own energy needs.  This means for all intents and purposes, there is no real threat than can be done to Russia, because they will have a massive gun to Europe's head in the form of being able to cut off their energy.  The USA talks a big game about ""consequences"".  But the USA doesn't have much collateral damage from inflicting these consequences on Russia.  In the end it will be the EU and Germany who decide how much ""consequences"" they can muster to inflict on Russia.  And, the EU will basically need to ASK Russia how much pain they can inflict, because if it's too much for Russia's liking, they can cut off Europe's energy, and send them into a seriously dangerous energy shortfall.

Both US Democrats' obsession with ""Green energy at all costs"", and Germany/EU's fear of allowing the USA more power in Europe are what allowed Russia to be in this situation of power.  The main point of this post, which I think is seldom brought up on Reddit in general, is the REAL WORLD implications of ""Green at all costs"" energy policies.  Sure, they sound great.  But in reality, what positive effects did it have?  Europe is turning on Coal and Oil plants due to energy shortfalls.  So instead of US natural gas, they're burning coal.  Is that ""green""?  And instead of the USA selling more gas, it's Russia.  Is that more ""green""?  


In simplest terms, the USA chose to allow Nord Stream pipeline, and shut down Keystone as well as other forms of energy production.  The USA cutting production did nothing at all to reduce global energy emissions.  All it did was move production to countries like Russia, allowing their authoritarian government more power, while not reducing emissions overall.

In hindsight, to me, the ""correct"" choice would have been for America to continue exporting energy, and further increasing production to a point where it could start slowly replacing Russian Gas... minimally to lessen Europe's reliance on Russia.  If that had taken place instead of ""Green at all costs"", Russia wouldn't have nearly as strong of a gun to Europe's head, and an invasion would be too costly to consider.  

Now instead of that outcome, we're going to have a war that will cause untold pollution and release of greenhouse gasses, and even disregarding the massive greenhouse output of war... Russia and OPEC are 1:1 replacing every bit of energy the US stops producing.  I'm all for ""Green Energy"".  But it can't be thought of as a solitary issue.  It is a global one, even when we're talking about a single nations' domestic energy policy.  This push for Green Energy in America not only hasn't resulted in any positive changes on a global level.  It's geopolitically made the USA/EU more reliant on Russia(for energy) and China(For Solar Panels/Turbines).",1639260267.0

rbkr9q,Why Ukraine Matters,1724,0.94,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/rbkr9q/why_ukraine_matters/,347,"After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success: ""[We came.  We saw.  He died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlz3-OzcExI&ab_channel=CBS)""  

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in this [recent interview](https://www.rbc.ru/finances/30/11/2021/61a613f49a7947fbdf06bf97), where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have [jumbo jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MGP7K93cSI&ab_channel=AssociatedPress) at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media [continue to prime](https://russian.rt.com/opinion/934510-dolgareva-ukraina-nato-rossiya) the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, [as reported by Kremlin-backed RT](https://russian.rt.com/world/news/934442-rossiya-lavrov-placdarm).  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",1638944937.0

I've read lots of things that say Putin is amassing troops along the border with Ukraine with the potential for an invasion of the country in the near future. Most of these articles explain the reasons for an invasion as a statement to the ""west"" that Russia is finished with NATO expanding closer to Russia, to destabilize the Ukrainian democracy, and move the country back into Russia's sphere of influence. 

However, what I have not yet found an answer to, what is Putin's endgame? Let's assume he uses the ground forces believed to be amassing on the border of Ukraine to invade. Then what? Does Russia annex the whole country? Do they move to the Dnieper or further into Kiev and Galicia? Do they remove the government and install a Russia-backed puppet government? To me, a full scale invasion does not seem useful just to destabilize the government.

# The Geopolitics of the Pampas

# Introduction

When you think of geopolitical conflict, South America is one of the last places that comes to mind. This continent is most well known for its coups, civil wars and general political instability left as a legacy of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule. In the alternate history community there is a running joke that South America always looks the same, even as the rest of the world is drastically changed from our world. All of this shows that the general perception of this continent is one of constant instability making it impossible for the continent’s nations to wage war against each other, because they are too busy fighting themselves. 

This however is not entirely true. The War of the Triple alliance waged between 1864 and 1870 saw Paraguay declare war on Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil in what seems like the most ridiculous scenario imaginable. However this conflict was over control of the vital rivers of the Pampas, and the balance of power in the region; with Paraguay fighting Brazil over which would dominate Uruguay. The War of the Triple Alliance was the pinnacle of the geopolitical importance of the Pampas, and it is important to understand the situation which Argentina and Brazil find themselves in, as it helps explain why South America is known for its lack of war. 

# The Pampas

To understand the geopolitical rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, you need to understand their geography, and the region known as the Pampas. Brazil is divided into the mostly backwater Amazon rainforest in the north, the densely populated coasts, and lastly the underpopulated interior between the Amazon and the coast. The coasts are the historical heartlands of Brazil as the coastal mountains prohibited settlement further inland, not to speak of the fact that much of the inner regions were too acid for growing crops, before discovering that it could be deacidified with lime. Due to the historical reality, much of the Brazilian population of over 200 million people are concentrated along the coast, with the southern region of Rio De Janeiro and São Paulo being the most developed and populated region in the country owing to Rio’s history as the capital city.

Argentina in contrast is divided starkly into the northern fertile plains and the southern Patagonian desert, with steppes suitable for pasture located between them. Due to the simple reality of climate, a majority of the Argentinian population of 45 million people are located in the north, concentrated along the Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. 

With the two countries' centers of population so close together, conflict between the two became inevitable after independence.  
 The naturally fertile region which the two countries share is located around the mouth of the Uruguay and Paraguay river is known as the Pampas. The hotbed of conflict only second to the Bolivian coast.

# The tale of two colonies

Another important piece to the puzzle of these two nations is the historical difference, most notably their colonisers. Following the treaty of Tordesillas dividing the new world between Spain and Portugal, the path was set for a division in the South American continent. Spain colonised the western half of South America, while Portugal colonized the leftover region of what would become Brazil. In time their style of administration drifted apart, as Spain kept tightening its grip on its colonies to make as much profit out of them as possible, while out of necessity the Portuguese granted increasing autonomy during their exile in Brazil. Once the two Iberian overlords were done with the Napoleonic wars, the colonial elites of South America had seen that their overlords were not invincible militarily. When Spain and Portugal tried to take back control, the colonies had enough and proceeded to declare independence, winning against their weakened overlords.   
 However the legacy of these separate colonisers is the cultural difference between Brazil and the rest of South America. Argentina speaks Spanish while Brazil speaks Portuguese. While not dramatic differences as Spain and Portugal are culturally and linguistically close, still it contributed to the difference between the two largest countries of South America.

# The delicate Balance

The reason for there being no open hostility between Argentina and Brazil is simple, geopolitical balance. The border territory that they share is flat grasslands, only broken by the several rivers running through the Pampas. With flat terrain suitable for swiftly advancing armies, distance and rivers are most essential for defensive strategy. The direct border between the two countries is limited to the 1224 kilometer long stretch of border which runs along the Uruguay river, making for a natural border. 

Uruguay acts as a vital buffer state between the two nations. If Brazil controlled Uruguay, they would be located just 40 kilometers away from Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. While it would secure Brazil’s control over the whole of the Uruguay river border, it would be an unacceptable reality for Argentina, which would no doubt do everything in its power to secure Uruguay for itself in order to defend its capital. If Argentina held Uruguay, it would place Argentinian forces to Border Brazil’s southern flank with the border on flat terrain without a large river, making Brazil’s defensive strategy obsolete. On top of this, the cities of Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio De Janeiro would no longer be behind a large river for the Argentinians, with Porto Alegre besieged from two sides should a war erupt. This would not be acceptable for Brazil, as it would not allow for its southern economic centers to be so vulnerable. Uruguay stands as the buffer between the Argeninian capital and the Brazilian southern economic centers, and as such it’s neutrality is essential for keeping the two big powers away from each other's throats. 

Paraguay sits as the second buffer state between Argentina and Brazil. While not as crucial at first sight, the length of the Paraguayan country makes it just as important as Uruguay. Lots of fertile farmlands are located along the banks of the Paraguay and Pilcomayo rivers. On top of the farmlands, Paraguay provides distance between Argentina and Paraguay, not to speak of the fact that the length of the border between the two states would more than double should either of them gain control over Paraguay. If Brazil controlled Paraguay, it would gain hundreds of more kilometers of buffer between the border and the Brazilian interior. However the length of the direct border with Argentina would lengthen by 1689 kilometers to a total of 2913 kilometers, spreading the forces of both nations thin. This would be unacceptable for Argentina strategically, as it cannot sustain as large of an army due to a significantly smaller population. On top of this, the Argentinian provinces of Misiones and Corrientes would be surrounded on three sides by Brazilian forces should conflict erupt, which would leave them vulnerable to encirclement, or force the Argentinians to leave an opening in the river defenses should they decide to pull back. If Argentina gained control of Paraguay, the Misiones salient would be eliminated, though the border with Brazil would lengthen by a thousand kilometers to a total of over 2224 kilometers. It would also place Argentine forces in a prime position to invade the Brazilian heartland, as Brasília, the capital of Brazil, would be at its closest only 1087 kilometers away from the border, with only flat farmlands providing Argentine forces with no natural barriers. It would also expose Brazil’s economic heart's western flank, allowing an Argentinian army to strike Sao Paulo from inland, instead of across the coastal mountains. This would not be an acceptable reality for Brazil, as It cannot allow Argentina to have flat terrain to invade into their capital without a large river in between. It’s almost the same distance to Brasília from the Argentine border, as it was to Moscow from the Molotov-Ribbentrop line that divided Poland, except this time there would be no snow or winter.

Paraguay stands as a mutually beneficial buffer, which allows both Argentina and Brazil to concentrate their forces along their mutual and shorter border, leaving neither side exposed on their flanks.

The current geopolitical situation of the Pampas benefits both Argentina and Brazil. Paraguay allows them to concentrate their forces on a shorter border, while Uruguay keeps both of their economic centers a comfortable distance away from each other. However should this balance be changed, the fertile Pampas might be set ablaze.",1638818253.0

r5mt9t,Could NATO Defend the Baltic States?,282,0.93,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/r5mt9t/could_nato_defend_the_baltic_states/,164,"With Russia becoming increasingly brazen on NATO’s Eastern Flank, the Baltic states aren’t looking as secure as they once were. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 by way of its ‘little green men’ could serve as a blueprint for how to threaten Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in future. How would NATO respond to an event like that, and what on-the-ground factors inform the nature of their response? 

On the panel to discuss this issue:

MATHIEU BOULÈGUE >> Senior Research Fellow for the Russian and Eurasian Program at Chatham House, author of many critical and influential papers on Russian and NATO defence doctrines.

THOMAS GRAHAM >>  Distinguished Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Co-Founder of the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Program at Yale University, Former Special Assistant to the President of the United States, Former Senior Director for Russia on the National Security Council Staff.

DAVID SHLAPAK >> Senior Defence Researcher at the RAND Corporation focusing on the Return of the Great Power Competition as the Defining Characteristic of the Global Security Environment, currently working on the Future of US Missile Defences, Considerations of Introduction of Nuclear Weapons into US Defence Planning, and the Technological Aspects of Long-term Competition with China.

There are fundamental challenges to the efficacy of NATO’s Baltic Defence plans. Key among these is Kaliningrad, the highly militarised Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. Housing extensive anti-air equipment, crack Russian troops, and the Baltic fleet, Russia has tremendous capacity to disrupt supply and movement into the Baltic states by theoretical NATO Forces. This capacity is particularly potent because the only way into the Baltics will be the Suwalki Gap in Northern Poland. 

Unusually, winter presents the best opportunity for incursion into the Baltics, as the ground has sufficiently frozen to allow troops movements. Outside of winter there are extensive problems with swamps and mud. 

The long-active spirits of independence in these states have made them hyper-aware of the danger on their Eastern border, and they have issued many alerts to NATO about their weakness to future Russian aggression. This aggression is not limited to a traditional ground-based operation, however. Russia has engaged in a good deal of cyberwarfare operations against all three states, and likely have substantial capacity that can be unleashed in the event of conflict. Similarly, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all heavily reliant on Russia for energy, yet another fundamental weakness they have in defence. 

So what can NATO do? They could seek to put huge numbers of troops in the Baltic states to make any immediate thrust less likely, but given the Russian focus on this flank a real ability to defend would require unprecedented investment in hardware and troops that few in NATO have shown any appetite for. Additionally, if Russia took control of the Suwalki gap in the event of conflict, there would now just be 30,000 troops stuck, cut off from supplies and reinforcements behind Russian lines. 

On the other hand NATO could effectively decide to let the Baltics fall, and build up a counterattack that they are very likely to win. This would probably work functionally, but is a pretty horrible prospect for the Baltic states. A counterattack could take months, let alone pushing Russian forces back out of the territory. Committing to or executing such a doctrine would severely hamper confidence in NATO, undermining a key principle of peace in the region and ironically maybe making conflict more likely as states seek other security arrangements, disturbing the status quo. 

In the last part of our analysis we talk to the man who wrote the book on this topic. David Shlapak’s report on NATO defence of the Baltics is extraordinarily influential, and so we pick his brain about what options NATO has. Pursuing Swedish membership of the alliance would enhance NATO’s ability to contest the Baltic states, as well as giving them another route for ground and air military operations. With so much anti-air equipment, is it even worth attacking Russian air bases? Or should NATO stick to just contesting its planes in the sky, where they have a much larger advantage? Shlapah has a few simple, non-expensive improvements and reallactions that could be made to NATO’s structure and armed forces that would significantly enhance their ability to respond to the Russian threat, and secure the Baltic states.

The Strategic Studies Doctorate program is in Washington DC with a strong faculty including the former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and other renowned experts in Foreign Policy and Security Studies.

The other program is in Boston and Northeastern has a very good reputation and better ranking and I can specialize in any policy track I want.

I’m indecisive about which program to go for. I’m interested in U.S. Foreign policy mainly the security policy towards global threats and want to be able to work in think thanks, consulting companies or the government. Teaching is not really in my plans but will not exclude a part time opportunity.

I’m currently a Global sanctions Analyst focusing on trade, economic and military sanctions across the globe and I have a Master in international security. My employer is paying for me so money is not an issue.

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/which-countries-are-on-the-right-track-according-to-their-citizens/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/which-countries-are-on-the-right-track-according-to-their-citizens/) This suggests to me that the average Chinaman is fairly happy with the status quo and current policies. 

On the hot topics of Uyghur's, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, I'm not sure policies in a democracy would be much different. I've talked to Chinese and there is much anger of Uyghur terrorist attacks and support for the government in neutralizing muslim extremists. There is also antipathy towards democracy in Hong Kong or greater China because there is skepticism that giving everyone an individual vote will change a system where inevitably the elite make decisions and are unresponsive to the populace. There is also a belief that Taiwan lost the civil war and should be unified with the rest of the country.",1638215948.0

Obviously no map is the territory, but models and frameworks can be useful for interpreting the world, and I very much enjoy learning about them. Although I'm a total novice so it can be challenging to discriminate between what is useful and isn't.


To that end, I'd be interested and grateful to hear if there's any frameworks that this sub would recommend learning  about.


I've stumbled across complexity theory recently which I've found very interesting, but difficult to understand. I've also been learning about spiral dynamics and integral frameworks too, but whilst potentially useful they're a bit less rigorous.


Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks!",1638143416.0
r4au0m,Why China can't replicate USA's success as sole global superpower and we are heading towards multipolar world order after USA's decline. My two cents.,47,0.96,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/r4au0m/why_china_cant_replicate_usas_success_as_sole/,55,"China doesn't have the capability to replace USA as the sole global superpower. With USA's decline we are heading towards multipolar world order. Here's why I think China can't replicate USA's global domination success story:

1. You have already mentioned that China doesn't have strong alliance like USA had. After 1945 USA had the backing of powerful western European countries who themselves were the previous superpower. Whereas China doesn't have any natural ally, it has border dispute and toxic relationship with all it's neighbor including Russia. 

2. China has isolationist policy unlike USA's globalization policy. Isolationism isn't exactly good for world domination.

3. After second world war Europe was destroyed and rest of the world was only getting independence from colonization. USA kind of had free run and was only big fish in the pond apart from USSR. Compared to today, there are too many big fishes in the pond which means too many competition for China to rule the whole pond. That's why after USA's decline, I think multipolar world order is ahead of us instead of USA style global superpower.

4. USA's soft power and cultural influence had a massive role in its world domination. It also had the advantage as the English speaking country which was already recognised as international language. I don't think China can replicate this success. I don't see mandarin getting recognition of international language nor Chinese film watched all over the world like Hollywood films.

5. China's geography isn't as advantageous as USA and to make matters worse China has made lots of enemies in the neighbourhood.

I would like to hear your counter arguments, also if you have more points to add, would like to hear them too.",1638124107.0

[https://www-mbl-is.translate.goog/frettir/innlent/2021/10/17/segir\_ad\_islendingar\_eigi\_ad\_lita\_stort\_a\_sig/?\_x\_tr\_sl=is&\_x\_tr\_tl=en&\_x\_tr\_hl=is&\_x\_tr\_pto=nui](https://www-mbl-is.translate.goog/frettir/innlent/2021/10/17/segir_ad_islendingar_eigi_ad_lita_stort_a_sig/?_x_tr_sl=is&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=is&_x_tr_pto=nui)

This would mark the first time that a sitting French president has paid visit to Iceland, and it's quite the leap to go from having an ambassador attending the event to the head of state himself. I can't help but suspect that this may tie into the EU's ongoing pivot towards the Arctic, and establishing a foothold in it would conceivably enable them to form a foreign policy independent of the US/NATO.",1638049395.0

Will we see less wars in the future?,33,1.0,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/r07ff1/is_the_frequency_of_wars_really_declining_will_we/,12,"A brief glance at the literature showed that most papers if not all were looking at state-based armed conflict related fatalities to gauge whether wars are on a decline or not, so I started looking for datasets on war fatalities and found [some charts](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace) on Our World in Data. I could have stopped at [this one showing a multi-fold decline](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/battle-related-deaths-in-state-based-conflicts-since-1946) and believed wars are indeed on a decline.

But [this article](https://oneearthfuture.org/opinion-insights/there-really-evidence-decline-war) offered a good collective sense of the skeptics and introduced me to [Prof. Tanisha Fazal](https://twitter.com/tanishafazal)'s [paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00166), which brought to my notice the major improvement in military medicine contributing to the decline in conflict related fatality. Look at the steep increase in wounded-to-killed ratio post \~1950:

We see 3 effects post \~1950:

1. A steep decrease in conflict related fatality.
2. One of the deadliest anomalies - namely WW2 - ended.
3. A steep increase in wounded-to-killed ratio in armed conflicts.

Thus I believe merely showing a decline in conflict-related fatality isn't enough to show a decline in wars.

I'm still thinking about and searching for answers to the following questions:

1. Are fatality numbers the best metric to gauge frequency of war?
2. Is the recent decline really a trend or a result of random variation? as suggested by [Prof. Bear Braumoeller](https://twitter.com/Prof_BearB) in [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2317269)

4. [What's the effect of improvements in weapon technology on fatality in armed conflicts in general?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/r0mfd3/how_has_the_improvement_in_weapon_technology/)
5. Did the fall of Soviet Union had anything to do with the decline in the frequency/lethality of wars post-1985 (a few years before 1991 possibly because of their weakening pre-disintegration)? My personal answer to this would be Yes, because the US & others in NATO were able to penetrate their enemy (for resource extraction and market  expansion) without much fighting.

I was told at school that Ratzul's ideas were actually peaceful and that his words were twisted by Germany just so it would be an excuse for Hitler to go on an invasion spree. 

However, when I did my research online about Ratzul and his effect on WW2, I realised that Ratzul was actually for the idea that countries need territorial expansion at the expense of other nations to gain more resources, as he thought a country was like a human being and their vital needs grow bigger and bigger as they develop. An idea which he called **lebensraum**

So, now I'm confused because it seems like what I learned is in contradiction with what I've read online. Was Razul actually misunderstood?

Also, I have to add that we also take Rudolf Kjellén and we learn that he's the true founder of the ideas that actually are not peaceful and could be justify Germany's actions during the war, so it's just getting very confusing at this point.

I was thinking that if there is a power vacuum in Addis then the Egyptian forces may be more willing to forcibly remove the dam. The alternative is that the new government may be more willing to negotiate around this issue in an attempt to get support from the international community/neighbors.

India isn't much better. Before you say their per capita emissions are low - this isn't true in practice. A significant portion of the population still live in or close to poverty (in India the vast majority still live in underdeveloped areas, in rural farms and villages); when we only include the proportion of the population who are actually using the energy produced (i.e.: the industrialists/factory owners and wealthy), emissions per person are high and can be expected to increase a worrying amount over the coming years.

Now I understand China and India want to prioritise economic growth over climate considerations, but why? The vast majority of China's population live in low-lying areas, and most of China's industrial complex is on the coast, and is very vulnerable to flooding. Meanwhile for India, some of its largest cities, like Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Visakhapatnam are on the coast and are already seeing the effects of climate change, while much of the north is vulnerable to drought and desertification.

I would understand these countries' attitudes if they weren't very vulnerable to climate change (like Russia), but they are - it seems totally counter to their self interests to care this little. And whether it's ""fair"" or not, the future of the planet largely depends on how Asia tackles energy production now\*.

Why are they not taking the necessary strides to reduce emissions (both countries have the resources and technology to move towards nuclear and hydroelectric) and what can be done to change this?

##FAQs:

### What is a ""Weekly Discussion Thread""?

Sometimes things are going on in the world you might want to talk about, but don't really have a lot of familiarity with.  

Sometimes you may want to talk about something with others in the community, but there isn't a thread on the first page.

qlfkc1,The effect of the Afghanistan war on the armed forces of European countries,23,0.96,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/qlfkc1/the_effect_of_the_afghanistan_war_on_the_armed/,0,"How did years of involvement in the Afghanistan war affect the armed forces of many European countries? During the Cold War, several European countries contributed to peacekeeping missions here or there. In the 90s, there was years of deployments to Iraq, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. 

For many on both the Western and Eastern ends of the continent, the last sign of combat they faced was the Korean War or World War II.  As such, Afghanistan was a wake up call for many of them whether smaller nations like a Estonia or countries mostly seen as peaceful havens like Norway/Denmark or former Warsaw Pact nations like Poland or even former world imperial powers like France and the UK. 

Germany deployed over 150 K troops in the 20 years that it's supplied troops while countries like Denmark and Norway have deployed over 10,000. 

That's a heavy commitment. I think most of us may forget that during the US' misadventure in Iraq, Afghanistan was heavily the commitment of European forces. It was only during the expansion of the security forces there in 2005/2006 in which NATO took overall command. 

To what extent was the Afghan war a different type of war for many European nations?  Were there any countries at risk of having their armed forces at the breaking point due to their commitment? I remember reading in 2007 that the UK had to withdraw from Iraq in order to reinforce its units in Afghanistan and for a time period, it was strained.

What were the battles and operations like for many of these countries? Counter-insurgency wasn't an expertise for the US Army, so how did say the Danish or Spanish armies fare with implementing it? What role did caveats play over the years with some nations opting out of sending combat troops?",1635890906.0
qld0zi,Brief History of American Intervention in Yemen,24,0.74,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/qld0zi/brief_history_of_american_intervention_in_yemen/,4," **Brief History of American Intervention in Yemen**  
 **2009 - 2021**

&#x200B;

In 2009 the United States Government made a deal with President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen requesting access to conduct operations against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The same group responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole, the attempted airline bombing on [Christmas Day over Detroit in 2009](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-sentenced-life-prison-attempted-bombing-flight-253-christmas-day), but more famously known for the massacre in France in response to the [Charlie Hebdo](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/14/europe/charlie-hebdo-france-attacks/) magazine attacks. AQAP was operating out of Southern Yemen at the time. In exchange, the Obama administration would [supply Saleh with weapons, money, and intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen/yemen-president-tackles-boosting-security-with-u-s-idUSTRE60116K20100102) to help fight against the AQAP.

[After support had arrived](https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/12/07/yemens-double-game-2/), President Saleh headed North with his new weapons, planning to attack his political rivals, the Zaidi Shi’ite Houthis. There are conflicting reports that the US Government knew this was President Saleh’s plan all along. Saleh had been using the supplies provided by the US Government to fight AQAP, but he also had been using them to fight his war in the North.

Unfortunately, Saleh’s war was not going as planned. Every time he attacked the Houthis, he lost. This failed military adventure had the exact opposite effect than intended. It allowed the Houthis to garner political and military power from their quick achievements throughout the North, making America’s allies in Yemen (Saleh) weaker.

The same thing was happening with the CIA’s drone war against AQAP in the South. Every time a drone strike was carried out, the [collateral damage](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/14/hidden-toll-of-us-drone-strikes-in-yemen-nearly-a-third-of-deaths-are-civilians-not-al-qaida/) was more significant than the number of dead jihadists—a reoccurring theme with Obama’s drone campaigns throughout the Middle East. With the increasing number of innocents killed, AQAP began to increase its numbers from the survivors of the drone strikes.

With enemies increasing in the North and South, the Americans were losing ground and influence. By 2011 Yemen became a big player in the [Arab Spring](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/arab_spring/Yemen), protesting American intervention within their Government. Saleh had been funded and armed yet ultimately failed not only in his wars to the North but his promised support fighting AQAP. At this point, Yemenis did not feel represented by their Government.

During the protests of the Arab Spring, President Saleh managed to hold onto power until he was injured in a second assassination attempt. A bombing that almost took his life. The Gulf Cooperation Council decided to remove President Saleh after his failures and months of protest. [Taking Saleh’s place](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-obama-idUSTRE7AM29B20111123) would be a new democratically elected President, his Vice President, Mansour Hadi. Who just so happened to be the only candidate on the ballot.

This election of a [single candidate](https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html) upset the Yemeni people. The only support realistically garnered by Hadi was from the Muslim Brotherhood group Al-Islah. After Saleh had recovered from his wounds, he decided that he wouldn’t be replaced so easily. It turned out that Saleh himself happened to be a Zaidi Shi’ite Houthi; with a large portion of his Army, joined his former enemies to the North, and [began a new war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-push-offensive-in-aden-killing-dozens-with-artillery-fire/2015/03/31/79f53d9e-d729-11e4-bf0b-f648b95a6488_story.html) against former Vice President and now current president President Hadi.

With most of the Yemeni Army underneath Saleh’s control, he began to march south, and by the end of 2014, he had [control of the capitol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0HH2BQ20140922). The Houthis had been successful and chased Hadi all the way South to the coastal city of Aden. The Wall Street Journal was now [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-citizen-held-hostage-in-yemen-released-by-houthi-rebels-1433178829) that the Obama administration had no problem with the Houthis and that if they wanted to help us fight AQAP, that was fine with them. The Obama administration started to provide the Houthis with intelligence to use against AQAP in January of 2015. Within two months, the Obama administration stabbed the Houthis in the back and decided to take the [Saudis and AQAP’s](https://www.fcnl.org/sites/default/files/documents/yemen_war_aiding_aqap_and_iran.pdf) side against the Houthis in operation Decisive Storm. 

The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-us.html) how the United States had shifted support from the Shi’ite Houthis to the Sunni Saudis and AQAP—giving the green light to the Saudis and providing intelligence, funding, and bombs. This war was launched without knowing what victory could look like in this region, and [US generals reported](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/17/us-generals-think-saudi-strikes-in-yemen-a-bad-idea.html) intervention ‘a bad idea’.

This new policy and backing of Saudi intervention in Yemen began a five-year-long siege on the people of Yemen. The US has provided [jets](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/middleeast/yemen-unrest/) and [naval support](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/20/politics/iran-united-states-warships-monitoring/), along with intelligence to the Saudis. Along with increased [sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/yemen.pdf) and the blocking of ports within the Gulf of Aden. Saudi Air Force has reportedly targeted [hospitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-hospital-bombing.html), water purifications plants, food sources, and sewage centers. These targeted airstrikes are the leading cause of [famine](https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/yemen-emergency) and a massive [outbreak of cholera](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7411249/) within the country. According to humanitarian aid workers, over [80,000 children have died](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983) from malnutrition and cholera, a disease easily treated with clean drinking water and essential antibiotics.

By 2017 Abdullah Saleh no longer had the support of the US or Saudi forces. He remained in command of the Houthi forces, who made up the majority of the Yemen military in the country. US foreign policy now backing the Saudi and AQAP, Saleh was becoming desperate. He had tried to make a secret deal with the Saudis by turning on his Houthi forces, and he was quickly [killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/former-yemen-president-saleh-killed-in-fresh-fighting) by his men just outside the countries capital days later.

Not much changed during the Trump administration. [The Saudis were unhappy about the JCPOA](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/10/11/why-the-saudis-would-cheer-the-de-certification-of-the-iran-deal/) deal made only a few years earlier, and Trump had decided to appease the Saudis even further by breaking the agreement with Iran. Not only was the JCPOA dead in the water but, the administration also continued Naval and Air support for the Saudi military. A deal was signed at the end of the Trump presidency to end the Saudi and AQAP support in Yemen. However, Pompeo did add the Houthis to the international terrorist list a week before leaving office. An important note is that they hadn’t been on this list the entire time during these interventions.

Biden, to his credit, has been trying to focus on ending all military support within this part of the Middle East. Next would be to begin flooding Yemen with as much humanitarian aid and supplies as possible. The unintended consequences of our foreign policy have led to thousands and possibly millions dead within the poorest country of the Middle East. The pattern of failed regime change and the eventual hotbed for anti-American sentiment in these countries is becoming history repeating itself.",1635883866.0

Below is a list of issues and developments which I feel are indicative of a worsening situation and worth discussing. For background, Ethiopia is constructing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which threatens the water security of Egypt and Sudan.

1. The African Union has suspended Sudan, while the United States and the World Bank have cut off foreign aid to Sudan until the previous government is restored. The military surely expected this, do they expect this to last, do they have alternate funding sources, or are they willing to sacrifice the economy?

2. The coup occurred mere hours after the coup leader, General al-Burhan met with US special envoy Jeffrey Feltman. The US State Department later claimed ""[they] were not given any heads up about this."" Was this simple conspiratorial security, or a message to outsiders to stay out?

3. General al-Burhan is said to be close with Egyptian leader al-Sisi, having been his host to al-Burhans first international trip in 2019. What will be their relationship moving forward?

4. The day after the coup, an Egyptian Cabinet Minister [announces](https://www.egyptindependent.com/egypt-says-prepared-for-possible-collapse-of-gerd/) they are prepared if the GERD should collapse. Coincidence or plausibly deniable message?


5. Ethiopia has been suffering embarrassing defeats against the Tigray rebels, which may embolden Egypt and Sudan to take action while they perceive Ethiopia to be distracted or otherwise weaker than previously believed. Despite this and the substantial funding and manpower differences, neither downstream nation has substantial experience fighting in mountainous terrain like that found in Ethiopia. Would an outside war unite Ethiopia or would outside support of rebels intensify the conflict?

6. The [border dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Ethiopian%E2%80%93Sudanese_clashes) between Ethiopia and Sudan near the Tigray conflict has not been resolved, and could easily escalate.

7. Meanwhile, Ethiopia has installed [Air Defense Systems](https://www.google.com/maps/@11.2759861,35.085475,932m/data=!3m1!1e3) over the last two years (Per Google Earth Historical Imagery,) suggesting they believe in a credible threat against the GERD. If anyone can identify these systems and speak to their abilities against Egyptian aircraft, I'd appreciate your insight. 

8. It is the end of the rainy season in the region. Following the second filling of the GERD [\(Completed in July\)](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/second-filling-ethiopias-giant-dam-nearly-complete-state-run-media-2021-07-19/) and faced with the arrival of the dry season and no agreement on water flow, downstream nations are facing the possibility of no control of their water supply.

9. The day after the coup, Egypt [ ended their state of emergency](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/egypts-president-sisi-ends-state-emergency-first-time-years-2021-10-25/) for the first time since 2017. Is this a genuine lessening of restrictions, or simply a pause in order to later declare a new one concerning water supply?

10. Given geography, would a conflict between the nations affect Red Sea transit or the Suez Canal?

I'm a little confused on the phrasing of this last one, but apparently either al-Burhan or an unnamed advisor has promised a [water war ""that would be more horrible than one could imagine"" unless the international community helped find a solution.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56799672).

Now the conflict is bubbling up again, with both states building up their armed forces, facing internal instability, and lashing out at each other with rhetoric. Will this escalation help secure Algeria’s future in the region, or fuel instability to the point of collapse?

On the panel to discuss this issue:

***JALEL HARCHAOUI*** \>> Senior Fellow at Global Initiative, specialising in Libya, Algeria, and North Africa

***ROBERT S. FORD*** \>> Former US Ambassador to Algeria, US State Department lead in Syria, Deputy US Ambassador in Iraq, and Chief of Mission in Bahrain, Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute, Professor at Yale University

***RICCARDO FABIANI*** \>> Reporter and Project Director for the International Crisis Group specialising in North Africa and the Sahel

The North African nation of Algeria is facing the consequences of its deep-rooted economic failures that have come about from decades of mismanagement and failure to diversify their economy away from oil. The economic health of the state is reliant on the international oil prices, setting a deeply unstable foundation for its future generations, and catalysing the protests across the nation calling for changes in leadership and economic policy. Concurrently, the country continues to struggle with its post-colonial national identity.

Located at the gates of the Sahel, Algeria has been an important actor in counter-terrorism in the region, facing threats both internal and external. The Algerian security services have fought extremists in North Africa for years, and the problem has flared up again recently. Algeria has experience cooperating with both UN peace and reconnaissance missions, as well as US/European counter-terrorism forces.

To understand Algeria, you must understand the flashpoint between Algeria and Morocco, the issue of Western Sahara, a disputed region currently majority occupied by Morocco that seeks its independence. Algeria is a dedicated defender of Western Saharan independence which has long been a thorn in the two states’ relationship, and will be for some time as Algeria remains committed. In august this year the two cut their diplomatic ties because of this conflict.

The French colonial legacy still remains significant in Algeria and seeps into its domestic and foreign politics. In recent years, the rifts and national narratives this legacy creates has become more important than ever as Algeria feels more and more geopolitically threatened. From the US partial withdrawal, to Morocco’s growing relations with Israel, the status quo is under threat, and Algeria feels on the losing side. Algeria has made moves to create their own independence and has challenged France by banning their airspace. The vacuum of the change in US policy has begun to be filled by Israel and Morocco, who Algeria fears above all may begin to exchange weaponry and destroy any equivalence between their armed forces and Morocco’s. Algeria is in a dangerous geopolitical neighbourhood, which includes Sahel terrorism, Malian border problems, Libyan chaos, and the Western Sahara conflict. If Algeria is backed into a corner, are they all the more dangerous and likely to strike out?

##FAQs:

### What is a ""Weekly Discussion Thread""?

Sometimes things are going on in the world you might want to talk about, but don't really have a lot of familiarity with.  

Sometimes you may want to talk about something with others in the community, but there isn't a thread on the first page.  

Sometimes you may have a general question, comment, random thought and etc. that you're just dying to share with the world of /r/geopolitics.  

This is the place to talk about all of that.  

### I've been wondering about something I think might be related to /r/geopolitics.  Where should I ask that question?

You've come to the right place!  Ask all general questions relevant to geopolitics here, too.  More relaxed, informal and/or casual comments are welcome and encouraged.",1634690919.0

I am new to the community but not new to enjoying good analysis about geostrategy, especially in relation to the current world order and its sustainability or downfall.  

I can find lots of interesting and compelling articles and analysis online about what kinetic conflict would look like in the Pacific between China/North Korea/Russia on one side and the US/Japan/South Korea and Australia on the other. 

I can find lots of interesting and compelling articles and analysis online about what kinetic conflict would look like in Eastern Europe between Russia/Belarus/Kazakhstan on one side and the Baltics/Ukraine/Poland and perhaps the US and UK on the other. 

I can find lots of interesting and compelling articles and analysis online about what kinetic conflict would look like in Central Asia, which would basically devolve into a Free-For-All quickly. 

What I cannot find is any analysis or any kind of reading by credible sources on what all of these actions would look like simultaneously. 

I think it would be unreasonable to assume, for example, that China and the US would start shooting at one another in the Pacific and expect the Russian state to not use this once-in-a-century opportunity to try and reclaim certain parts of their empire lost in 1991 (should that be in their strategic interests (which I believe it is)).  

Conversely, should things go hot in Eastern Europe - I don't think the PLA would sit by and pass up the opportunity to ""re-unify"" with Taiwan (or the Korean peninsula going hot). 

By the same token, if the US was distracted in two theaters simultaneously, would Iran use this opportunity to strike Israel?  What would the Israeli response be? 

I would love book suggestions, blogs, podcasts, etc., etc., The fact I cannot find anything interesting tells me this might be the ""base case"" for whatever is to come. 

Everyone's thoughts are appreciated.",1634637761.0

qaz9p3,"Could a 21st Century Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between China, Russia, and USA, avoid the Thucydides Trap?",29,0.95,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/qaz9p3/could_a_21st_century_molotovribbentrop_pact/,62,"It seems like a lot of recent discussions here have been focused on the ""inevitability"" of war between the U.S. and China (and Russia to a lesser extent). While I worry about that as a self-fulfilling prophecy, I think it's clear to Beijing, Moscow, and Washington that any extensive conflict among them would be borderline suicidal.

Another common strain on this site is that the U.S. is slowly retreating from the international system toward the 'Fortress America' isolationist mentality that was common zeitgeist prior to World War II. This strain is often coupled with a belief that because the American electorate has soured on the current world order, globalization and its resultant de-industrialization, and military free loaders in NATO and the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. will continue to retreat from an idealistic dogma of defending defending democracy and Western ideals, and move toward a hard-edged jingoist realpolitik.

We saw this with Trump and 'America First' and Joe Biden hasn't reversed it much with 'Make it in All of America.' When American national security officials speak of geopolitics, they espouse language that is deeply insular and isolationist. In February, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was asked about the Biden foreign policy regime. His response? “Right now, the most profound national security challenge facing the United States is getting our own house in order, is domestic renewal,” [https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/02/25/joe-bidens-foreign-policy-america-first-twist/4345647001/](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/02/25/joe-bidens-foreign-policy-america-first-twist/4345647001/)

But if China wants Taiwan, Russia wants Ukraine, and the U.S. wants to revive ""Fortress America"" and address the geographic risks of climate change, why can't a Molotov-Ribbentrop arrangement be an option to avoiding Total War?

I don't mean to be provocative or tactless, but in a world where the U.S. is, shall we say, Trumpian nationalist, what is preventing the three powers from negotiating among themselves to step aside as each other aggrieve perceived historical wrongs.?

In this scenario, the U.S. could guarantee China they won't intervene in the military annexation of Taiwan, will recognize Hong Kong as an inviolable part of China, and maybe will look the other way as China takes a bite of Mongolia or the South China Sea. Russia will similarly be promised non-aggression as they seek to finalize the Union State with Belarus and make a go of annexing Ukraine. The U.S., meanwhile, could resolve historical wrongs including by annexing Greenland (which Trump was enamored with), toppling the Havana government and annexing Cuba (reversing the ""great mistake"" - aka Teller Amendment of 1898), and maybe even making a go of annexing Canada, righting the 'lost opportunity' of 1812?

Of course this all might sound outlandish, but is it impossible? The end result, of course, would be a historic betrayal of Washington's foreign ideals since WWII. It would also essentially dissolve the Western alliance, end NATO, and move the world towards a Darwinian reality of might makes right. But I do worry the U.S. people are barreling toward a perspective of ""Why should we defend our NATO allies if they criticize us nonetheless and are vehemently anti-American?""

If the current world order does collapse, does it have to be because of the Thucydides Trap? Or could it be not by bang, but by whimper (to quote T.S. Eliot) - because of a Molotov-Ribbentrop equivalent where China, Russia, and USA do a 21st Century Great Sorting among themselves, while the rest of the world, to quote Thucydides, ""suffer what they must""?

Or would such an agreement by its very nature collapse, much as the original Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not prevent Germany and the USSR from war, but merely delayed it?",1634601403.0

q99qqj,New war in Bosnia,521,0.96,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q99qqj/new_war_in_bosnia/,114,"The political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the worst since the end of the war. After a decade of rising tensions by the leader (Milorad Dodik) of the Serb entity Republika Srpska, the culmination came this summer with the election of a new High Representative Christian Schmidt (possible higher engagement of European Union and West in Bosnia), imposing a law banning denials of war crimes in the Bosnian war 92-95 ([Serbs deny Srebrenica genocide](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/23/bosnias-peace-envoy-imposes-jail-terms-for-genocide-denial)) by former High Representative Valentin Inzko, the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina granting ownership of land and forests directly to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina  (not to its entities) and stronger US involvement with new sanctions against corruption ([Dodik to US envoy Escobar: F\*\*k the sanctions)](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/dodik-to-us-envoy-escobar-fk-the-sanctions/).  


An escalation came a few days ago when [Dodik announced RS withdrawal from BiH army, police, intelligence service, tax and judiciary system](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/dodik-announced-rs-entity-withdrawal-from-bih-army-tax-admin-and-judiciary/). In the complex BiH government structure, these decisions should be made in the state parliament (where Dodik does not have a majority). Instead, the decision will be made by the entity national assembly [in a few days](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/speaker-rs-parliament-could-adopt-dodiks-announcements-by-the-end-of-october/), causing a new de facto situation on the ground where state forces will be ordered to leave the RS entity territory.   


It is to be expected that Bosnian forces will not leave RS voluntarily. It is also to be expected that the majority of Serb members of the state army and police will side with Dodik. In such a situation, a conflict between the pro-Bosnian state army and police forces and Serb members of the army and police or a conflict between the RS special police forces (there are state and entity police working in parallel in BiH) and army members is inevitable. After the outbreak of the conflict, Serb barricades on the entity lines were to be expected (the situation of Serb barricades seen at the beginning of the war in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s). If those incidents happen in a few weeks / months, you should know that the new war in Europe started. We can say with 99% certainty that a decision on the expulsion of state forces from the RS entity will be made. The question is whether the ultimatum to leave the territory will be a few days / weeks (war) or half a year - a year (negotiations).  


The military-geopolitical situation on the ground is such that only a contingent of 600 EUFOR soldiers whose mandate expires in November is currently operating in BiH. An extension of the mandate requires a decision in the UN Security Council. Russia's decision to veto could show how serious the current situation is. Russia's veto ([announced this summer](https://www.sarajevotimes.com/moscow-could-respond-by-blocking-the-continuation-of-eufor-mission-in-bih/)) would leave only the Bosnian and Serb forces on the ground in Bosnia, which would practically mean the realization of the above scenario.   
There are currently no statements by Western officials in Bosnia about military intervention due to the deteriorating political situation ([""Just calls to engage from some Western NGOs""](https://twitter.com/DPC_global/status/1448617211325734913?s=20), although Annex 1 of the Dayton Peace Agreement (which is still in force) allows NATO to intervene freely due to breach of the agreement ([""It is understood and agreed that NATO may establish such a force, which will operate under the authority and subject to the direction and political control of the North Atlantic Council (“NAC”) through the NATO chain of command.""](http://www.ohr.int/dayton-peace-agreement/annex-1a/)). In response to this, it was announced that Russia would enter the conflict due to the activation of NATO forces ([""If that is necessary, we will defend ourselves with our own forces. If it happens that they say NATO will intervene, we will ask our friends – who told us clear and loud they never abandon their friends – to help us,""](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/dodik-republika-srpska-would-ask-friends-to-help-in-case-of-nato-intervention/)).  


The secession of RS is not expected to receive recognition from the EU and the US, which is likely to lead to sanctions against RS, which will put RS and Serbia in a difficult economic situation. The biggest winner will be Russia, which will open a new conflict in the EU's backyard.",1634381706.0

External powers are divided and reluctant to step in, while the UN succeeded in filling its long-vacant envoy position only in October 2021.

Diplomatic inattention risks pushing the two sides toward further military escalation. Tensions also threaten to spill over into the rest of North Africa and beyond, as highlighted by diplomatic spats between Morocco and each of Algeria, Germany and Spain.

With U.S. diplomatic support at the UN Security Council, the new UN envoy should focus on rebuilding confidence and relaunching negotiations, backed by other outside actors and specifically the EU, which should deploy a mix of financial incentives and disincentives.

Two articles from the WSJ on the subject today:

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-strategic-vulnerability-russia-europe-energy-vladimir-putin-nord-stream-2-11633732051](https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-strategic-vulnerability-russia-europe-energy-vladimir-putin-nord-stream-2-11633732051)

In the previous decade, after experiencing some benefits of energy independence and its strategic value, the US is once again sending diplomats to Saudi Arabia and pleading for help. Europe will need to depend more on Russia. For consumers, increasing energy prices is a tax that may lead to a recession. Global investment firms have cut America's growth by more than half for 2022 because of these issues.

How were the Western gains of energy independence reversed so fast? Is there a better way to achieve climate goals without sacrificing the importance of energy independence in the US and in Europe?

Cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline was one of the first decisions made by the current US Administration. Would approving Keystone XL have prevented the current crisis? No, but it set the tone for how the USG would prioritize climate goals over the tangible value of energy independence. Since then, ESG movements in the markets have increased divestments in the fossil fuel industry, leading to decreased investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, leading to a shortage of workers needed to meet rising demands. Carbon emission-reduction plans have decreased the supply of coal available and increased the shortage of coal workers. Instead of strengthening America's natural gas industry and its infrastructure -- like the storage of liquified natural gas -- government policy has shifted the focus of the marketplace elsewhere. In Europe, decreasing strength of winds has reduced the ROI on clean energy investments and has further increased their dependence on Russia.

In short, voters in the West were promised a revitalized energy industry by their government's shift towards renewable energy policies. Instead, consumers are being taxed, the economy is at risk of slipping into a recession, and the West is becoming dependent on less cooperative governments in other continents. Is the West making a geopolitical miscalculation?",1633967822.0

q27sl8,7 key trends whose inter-play can cause significant global geo-economics turmoil,30,0.96,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q27sl8/7_key_trends_whose_interplay_can_cause/,8,"I would like to table 7 key trends that I sense have become more exacerbated and I see them causing significant global geo-economic turmoil in the near future (6 months-1 year),

1. **The** **deflation risk**: The US and other western economy have built up an enormous amount of liquidity as part of COVID economic fallout containment measures. A lot of this liquidity was 'helicopter money' with far less of it going to building up sustained economic activity or infrastructure - resulting in it contributing to higher inflation. Already  inflation in US, UK, Germany, France etc are reporting the highest inflation recorded in 10-30 years. The risk here is that **sustained inflation may lead to lasting and strong demand deflation amongst the world's big consumer markets, adversely impacting businesses and cross-border trade globally**.
2. **The China risk**: Alarming economic news from China - crackdown on tech and businesses had been coming for some time. The current real estate ""crisis"" (if it turns out to be one) - has the risk of erasing significant value trapped in Chinese real estate - which in turn would **lead to significant erosion of consumer confidence, consumption and appetite for lending amongst financial institutions - a recipe for recession**. Obviously given the sheer size of the chinese economy any ""x %"" hit will have global reverberations.
3. The **supply chain risk**: We recently had large media houses such as even CNN reporting about a potential risk of a ""supply chain collapse"". Container shipping rates have gone up by 5-10x and social media is full of alarming visuals of endless cargo ship pile-ups. Given poor customer fulfillment by global supply-chains as well as **increased cost for both manufacturers and consumers**, there is likelihood of fall in demand and supply. Additionally, the b**uilt up inventory as it is released into the market will again lead to a supply glut** which will **suppress demand** and lead to inventory losses for manufacturers. Given that global trade is \~$20 Tn or 20% of global GDP - again a supply chain shock of a ""x %"" hit will cause a massive bill.
4. **The energy risk**: Prices are surging across the fuel spectrum, from Natural gas, Coal to Gas, as economies push to re-start and hit the U-shaped recovery of their economies. However excessive heating of demand can have a whiplash effect due to excessively **high energy costs and cause a demand drop from consumers as well as a supply drop as producers are unable to meet the high energy bill**. China is already resorting to wide-spread power cuts and India is expected to follow suit soon.
5. **The climate risk**: Climate instabilities are manifesting in increasingly starker ways - widespread falls in food production from in Latin American and African nations, prediction of an unexpectedly cold winter this year that will further exacerbate energy demand in the Northern Hemisphere and global water shortages. This again has a **potential to decimate growth, especially in developing economies**.
6. **Covid-2x?**: While vaccinations have clearly ensured that the worst of the COVID crisis is behind us, there are still **possibilities of significant waves, especially in winter**. Threat of a new break-out variant still looms impacting global travel and movement, adding to economic uncertainties. Moreover there have been, unforeseen consequences of mass vaccination such as the Australian trucker strikes, mass firings/resignations in the US of ""non-vaxxers"", etc And even as we try and combat COVID, the **recent case spike seen in Israel, despite almost global high vaccination and vaccination fatigue may mean that COVID still has a potential to cause massive pain to the global economy**.
7. **Geo-political risks**: I distinctly ""feel"" that the world has worsened in terms of geo-political stability v/s pre-COVID. South China sea is at a historic high in terms of tensions and the situations is worsening between China and India in the Himalayas. An Afghanistan under Taliban has apparently opened a Pandora's box in Central Asia, even as there are new tensions between Turko-Azeri alliance and Iran. Most sub-saharan powerhouse economies such as South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia seem to be facing significant internal turmoil. A combative Biden administration is testing nd pushing back an equally combative Putin who recently tested a 2k km range sub-launched hypersonic missile capable of carrying a tactical nuke. Israel's neighborhood seems restive especially given the situation in Lebanon. The only bright spot seem to be the rapprochement between Israel and Gulf countries but even there it is shaping more like an alliance pitted against Turkey. Even in the EU we see small but not insignificant friction between Eastern European nations such as Hungary-Czech-Poland v/s the rest. There is also increasing break-down in co-operation, most notably between UK and Franco.

I welcome your views on the trends listed above,

q1z3to,Geopolitical consequences of EV's rapid growth and the decline of oil demand analysis.,36,0.97,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q1z3to/geopolitical_consequences_of_evs_rapid_growth_and/,32,"Rapid growth – for those you not aware or not following the news there has been a ridiculous growth of electric vehicles particularly within this year in 2021. China plan by 2025 was that 20% of the cars sold would be EV’s that pretty much happened this August. OPEC recently released figures saying that will demand will plateau by 2035 - for those of you who do not know OPEC typically massively overestimates oil demand as we can see with their predictions failing by over 12 million barrels of the last one they made and the reason why they do this is for more investment within the oil industry. There are massively rising oil prices and the fact that the Iran nuclear deal has a very good chance of not being signed this year means that oil prices will likely hit the range of $90 to $110 which is significantly higher than what most oil importers would be comfortable with and therefore this will massively increase investment within renewables it is something called demand destruction. What it essentially means is that due to the massive growth of electric vehicles demand for oil will rapidly decline much quicker than expected recently Sinopec based off the assumptions of 2025 that EV sales will be 20% estimated that oil demand in China will peak by 2026 however experts predict that there is a likelihood of every single car by 2030 being electric and even this itself is a conservative estimate it happening quicker this will have a great deal of geopolitical consequences. The Indian energy minister said that if oil prices remain this high this will lead to a much quicker energy transition then what they are currently panning - this was a very thinly veiled threat at OPEC and it seems that the prudence of Saudi Arabia with oil has disappeared with the current incompetent leadership of MBS.

This will lead to decline of oil demand due to the fact that investments in renewables are growing at a ridiculous rate seeing as natural gas prices are nearly at an all time high and oil prices are also remarkably high when there’s an energy transition going on making the decision extremely easy for investors. 

The big losers of the decline of oil demand will be the gulf Arab states. Countries such as Russia and Iran would be much less affected due to the fact of sanctions and the fact that they have weathered lack of oil sales well. I believe within the Middle East this will massively shift the power balance towards Iran due to the fact that the US would likely see no strategic benefit of staying within the Middle East and being with actors that have unsavoury human rights practises and in addition to that they will likely just want to cut the losses and focus on the large strategic challenge of China this would also likely lead to a significant decrease of the relationship with Israel due to the fact that there is a left wing faction that is growing with significant support from the electorate that vehemently opposes Israel . I will not be surprised if the social contract within these rentier states is completely broken and there’s revolution within some of the most sensitive parts of the world this would likely lead to massively increasing Iranian hegemony within the Middle East and Israel will likely lose a significant portion of its allies.

The big winners will be developing countries. For those of you who followed China’s economic rise they would know that due to the fact that China had such a significant impact on the oil prices they would limit the amount they would buy so that you wouldn’t completely destroy their current account surplus - if oil prices can collapse due to lack of demand from developed countries developing countries can develop much quicker due to the fact that importing energy will not significantly affect them the biggest winners will be India Bangladesh Vietnam Pakistan Ethiopia South East Asia and other countries who are rapidly growing they need energy they would likely develop much quicker rate than even trying to did however obviously some developing countries like Nigeria may be thrown into instability with the lack of oil sales. 

Overall in my opinion watching the growth of EV’s is one of the most important things anyone can do in terms of watching geopolitics.",1633448609.0

Even though American support in the sphere of intelligence, airlift and nuclear arms is indispensable, the two East European countries must continue to invest in expanding their own conventional capabilities and try to keep up with the pace of Russian military modernization as much as they can. One source estimates that to match the forces Russia is able to project in the area, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states together would need to have the capacity to deploy on short notice 700 000 troops, 11 000 IFVs, 5000 MBTs and at least 800 non-nuclear intermediate range missiles, though it isn’t specified whether that includes sizable allied contingents or not.

I have translated and summarized one of the most popular posts on Zhihu (China's Quora) about Chinese- Indian relations. I feel this is useful information to share as it summarizes and explains the CCP's current view of India (accurate based on my personal links to CCP) and explains why China behaves so antagonistically. This post is **LONG** but is still much shorter than the original. The original has 9 chapters, chapters 5 - 9 focusing on Chinese military strategy in a Sino- Indian war. In the r/india post I have focused on the politics and reasons for conflict described in chapters 1-4. **For** r/geopolitics **I have added a shortened version of chapter 5 describing the importance of Taiwan in Chinese grand strategy.**  I have left out most of the historical background, Chinese idioms and cultural aspects in an effort to shorten the post. **The most important parts are in bold and italicized, I would highly recommend reading those**. Feel free to pm with any questions, Ill try to answer some in the comments. Apologies in advance for mistranslations and/or incorrect information.

If this post gets enough attention, I will post all the chapters and maybe even the full translation. if you want to read the full post I have attached the link. Google translate is 70% accurate and there are a few very important errors.

**Link to post:** [**https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401**](https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401)

**Chapter One, India is big trouble for China in the future**

Today, China faces significant problems on its borders, totally surrounded by strong neighbors. The United States has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security. Russia. although it has a small population, has a large geographical advantage . Although Sino-Russian relations are good in the short term, it could be a big variable in the long run. However, an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is India. India is very weak on the surface, but has a greater potential for development. If you take the long-term view, India is likely to be a significant power in the future.

One reason many people like to laugh at India is that in the 1980s, the economic strength of China and India was evenly matched, but after China’s reform and opening up, China’s economy grew rapidly, and China’s GDP is now five times that of India. This shows how slow India’s economic growth is. However, if you compare it on a global scale, you can actually find that India’s economic growth is not slow. Since 1980, India’s GDP has increased 30 fold. In contrast, the GDP of other developing countries except China and India has only increased 10 fold, and the GDP of developed countries has even increased 8 fold. To a certain extent, it is not that India’s economic development is slow, but that China’s economic growth is too fast. ***China’s economic achievements conceal India’s economic miracle. If there is no comparison with China, then India’s economic growth can be considered a global miracle.***

On the other hand, China’s rapid economic growth has not come without a price. Due to strict family planning rules, China today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time. India has not implemented such a strict family planning policy, and the proportion of young people is very high. Although this has dragged down economic growth, India’s demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years. We know that young people are the main creators of social wealth, and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of China. To some extent, if the number of young people in India is twice that of China in 2050, even if India’s per capita output is only half of China by then, India’s GDP will be on par with China and become the world’s top three economies.

A power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated, although India is a very weak country at the moment, and the lower limit is low; but the future development potential is very large, the upper limit is very high. Although China is now flourishing, if one day the country is facing an aging crisis, on one hand, fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers, on the other hand, the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time, the national willingness to fight is reduced. At that time, it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising India than it is now.

**Chapter Two, the conflicts between China and India can hardly be reconciled**

It is difficult to reconcile the China-India conflict, just as it was difficult to reconcile the China-Soviet conflict before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The underlying reasons are not explained by ideology, territorial disputes, cultural differences, or foreign policy.

In the 1960s and 1980s, China’s greatest threat was from none other than the Soviet Union. If a torrent of Soviet tanks goes south from Mongolia, it will hit Beijing within a week. Since ancient times, the greatest external threat to China has been from the North. And in modern times, Soviet Russia has assumed this role. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks. This was similar to ancient cavalry, fast and ruthless, able to tear a hole in the opponent's defenses in a very short time

The key issue is that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained absolute geographic superiority . The Soviet Union not only controlled the outer northeast, but also Mongolia. When the Soviet Union did not control Mongolia, if the Soviet Union wanted to attack China, it still had to go south from the Northeast Plain and enter North China after conquering the Shanhai pass. But with control of the Mongolian Plateau, the Soviet Union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking China. Soviet tanks only had to cross the Yinshan Mountains to enter Hebei. After that, Beijing would be basically insecure to defend. In this case, China may only have to move south like the Central Plains dynasties in the past, and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the Soviet army.

This is the fundamental reason why China would fight with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and cooperate with the West without hesitation. As long as Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, China’s national defense cannot be assured. Thanks to an independent mongolia, China and Russia are moving towards reconciliation, in the long run, due to Russia's natural geopolitical suppression, it is still a potential threat, and China and Russia still guard against each other.

Taking the example of the Soviet Union, we can understand why Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile. ***The geography of India is very similar to China The main population centers of China are on the North China Plain, and Beijing is the throat into the North China Plain. The population centers of India are on the Ganges Plain, and New Delhi is the throat to enter the Ganges Plain. The south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline, and the southeast has a large island like Sri Lanka.***

But compared to China, India's geography is extremely bad. All of the core areas of India are in the hands of other countries (Indus river, Lower Ganges, Siri Lanka). India does not have many natural barriers. The coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west, while China only needs to defend the east. This makes India very easy to invade as seen in history. ***This is the reason why India invaded Tibet in the 1960s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time. It cannot be said that India is a militaristic state, but because in the context of geographical disadvantages, it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents.***  
For India, China is the biggest geo-threat. This is because China not only controls the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but also is an ally with Pakistan. Once China and India go to war, India will almost certainly lose without external intervention. India’s Ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage. The geographical disadvantages of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the alliance between China and Pakistan are part of the reasons why China-India relations cannot be reconciled. ***But in the long run, even if China and India can complete the territorial conflicts and China and Pakistan no longer are allies, it will be difficult for China and India to reconcile completely. The reason is that both China and India want to become superpowers and leaders in Asia, inevitably leading to strategic collisions.***  
In the future, if both China and India want to rise up and become leaders in Asia, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise. The key point of the conflict is Southeast Asia, the backyard of both counties. Southeast Asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries. Forming battlegrounds for any major countries. China and India both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region. Southeast Asia has many Chinese and Indians. To a certain extent, Southeast Asia is to China and India what Latin America is to the United States, Eastern Europe is to Germany and Russia, and North Korea is to China and Japan. They belong to the range of interests that must be contested.

Therefore, if both China and India become stronger in the future, they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in Southeast Asia. On land, India can rely on the northeast states to infiltrate Myanmar and radiate to the Indochina Peninsula. On the sea, India can rely on the Andaman Islands to increase its influence on the Southeast Asian islands. This is similar to China. On land, China relies on the Trans-Asian Railway/Pan-Asian Highway to increase its radiation to the Indochina Peninsula, and on the sea, it relies on the Nansha Islands to increase its influence on Southeast Asia.

***Therefore, Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile unless three conditions are met: 1. China withdraws from Tibet, or the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau becomes a neutral buffer area similar to Mongolia; 2. China abandons support for Pakistan; 3. China and India abandon the competition for Southeast Asia. None of these three items can be done by China. Tibet is an indivisible part of our territory. Although India has long supported ""Tibet independence"", it is impossible for China to give up Tibet. It is also impossible for China to give up support for Pakistan, Because once you let India unify South Asia, India will be the spearhead aimed at our country. Even more difficult to deal*** ***with. It*** ***is also impossible to give up Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is our natural economic backyard, and has economic and military dual significance.***

In the short term, the main contradictions are 1 and 2, but as India's national strength over Pakistan get bigger and bigger, we cannot rule out that one day Pakistan will be completely defeated by India or even annexed, by that time China's direct geopolitical threat to India will be greatly reduced, if India can also annex Nepal, Bhutan and other countries, then it will have a pivot point in the Tibetan Plateau, and it will be difficult for China to go over the Tibetan Plateau to directly invade India. At this time, the Sino-Indian territorial dispute will no longer be the main conflict, and the main conflict will change to a struggle for spheres of influence.

***The nature of India's threat is the same as that of Russia and Japan; it is a territorial and existential threat. India, on the one hand, has ambitions to encroach on our territory, which is different from the United States, which focuses on economic interests. India also has attempts to dominate South Asia and encroach on Southeast Asia. When China is strong, both the United States and India will adopt a hostile policy toward China; but when China is in decline, the United States may relax its restrictions , but India will not. If one day India is strong and China is weak, then India will intensify its aggression against our territory and even threaten the safety of our national life and property.***

**Chapter Three, the dilemma of two-front warfare, China does not occupy an absolute advantage on the Sino-Indian border**

***The Chinese front is too long and needs to be guarded separately.***

To the east is Japan and South Korea, to the southeast is Taiwan that has not yet returned, to the south are the Southeast Asian countries with territorial disputes, and to the north is Russia, which has occupied the most territory in China in history. In the west of our country, the situation is more complicated. There are religious and ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang and Tibet, and India is eyeing them. This means that although our country is strong, it needs to be guarded by separate troops

Division of Chinese theaters and deployment of forces:

Northern Theater -- 3 army groups, North Sea Fleet-- Russia, Korean Peninsula

Eastern Theater -- 3 army groups, East China Sea Fleet, half of the air force-- U.S., Japan, Taiwan

Southern Theater -- 2 army groups, South China Sea Fleet-- United States, Southeast Asian countries

Central Theater -- 3 armies-- Guards the capital and reserve for other war zones

Western Theater-- 2 armies-- India

Division of Indian military districts and deployment of forces:

Northern Military District -- 3 army groups -- Kashmir, the western section of the China-India border

Western Military Region -- 4 army groups -- Middle section of the China-India border

Eastern Military Region -- 3 armies, East Sea Fleet -- Eastern section of the China-India border

Central Military Region -- 1 army -- Guarding the capital

Southwest Military Region-- 1 army --- Pakistan

Southern Military Region -- 2 armies, West Sea Fleet -- Guarding South India

India can use most of its military power against China. The Indian army has 1.15 million troops and has a total of 14 armies, of which 10 are dedicated to fighting China, accounting for 70% of its army. As for the navy, when a war breaks out between China and India, if the United States and India have good relations, India can send its entire navy to the Andaman Islands to block the Strait of Malacca. While most of the Chinese navy will be deployed in the Pacific to confront the United States and Japan. In terms of air force, northern India has a flat terrain and numerous airports, which can accommodate all the fighters of the Indian Air Force. However, there are not enough airports in Tibet to park a large number of fighters. ***If a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, how much force can be used to fight against India?***

It may be difficult for China to deploy troops on a large scale to support the battlefield, because each army group has clear responsibilities. Once a large number of troops are deployed, it will inevitably lead to weakness and give other countries a chance. For example, the 82nd Army is used to guard the capital , the 82nd Army is equipped to fight on the Great Plains, its plateau combat ability is not a strong point  
***This means that once a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, we may only be able to mobilize 5 army groups to fight, while the Indian side can mobilize at least 10 armies in response.*** Due to restrictions on the throughput of Tibet’s airports, the number of soldiers that can be sent to Tibet is also relatively limited, and most of the air force still has to stay in the east to confront the United States and Japan. As the Strait of Malacca is controlled by other countries, the possibility of our navy crossing the Strait of Malacca and fighting the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean is currently unlikely. Therefore, theoretically speaking, China would have to use 40% of the army, less than half of the air force, and close to 0% of the navy in the Sino-Indian war against 70% of the Indian army, close to 100% of the navy and air force. Currently, I believe that if there is no external interference, China can defeat India with only half of its military power. however, In the most likely situation for war, although our military is far stronger than India, it does not occupy an absolute advantage.

***In short, in the context of a potential encounter, China has several major disadvantages against India:***

***1. China's main strategic focus is in the east, 70% of its military power will be used to confront the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and it will not be able to spare a hand to deal specifically with India.***

***2. Since 2016, the United States has gradually locked China as its number one competitor. If China starts a war against India, if it is a protracted war, the United States and the West will inevitably intervene. At that time, there may be wars in Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea. Creating a 2 fronts situation***

***3. 60% of China's oil imports pass through the Strait of Malacca, and a large amount of export trade also goes through this place. Once fighting against India begins, India or the US may take advantage by blockading the Strait of Malacca. China's crude oil reserves can only support 6-12 months during the war***

***4. The risks and pressures of the two- front warfare can be handled in a war against India. However, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is complex and the railway cannot support the logistics required for large-scale military operations.***

&#x200B;

 **Chapter 5: Regaining Taiwan is a prerequisite for resolving the Indian issue**

The importance of Taiwan is self-evident. First , Taiwan is a barrier to the southeastern coast. If Taiwan is controlled by an enemy country, the southeast coast of China, the most developed economic area, will become the frontline. Enemy aircraft can take off from Taiwan and bomb Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, etc. Secondly, Taiwan is a springboard for China's eastward exit into the Pacific. If Taiwan is recovered, the East China Sea Fleet can be stationed at Keelung Port. The US and Japan’s naval and air bases will easily become targets for our military, and the United States may shrink the line of defense from Ryukyu to Guam. Around. Therefore, for our country, the strategic value of Taiwan at the moment is far greater than that of Mongolia and southern Tibet.

At present, our military's technical means to regain Taiwan are mature. Our military far exceeds Taiwan's in terms of scale and equipment. The navy, air force, and rocket forces can suppress Taiwan in all directions. The biggest problem in regaining Taiwan lies in US interference. The United States' support to Taiwan can be described as unscrupulous. It not only sells equipment to Taiwan, but also allows the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to be undervalued, allowing Taiwan to enjoy a high trade surplus. This is a treatment that Japan and South Korea do not enjoy. Taiwan is a trump card for the United States to beat China, so the United States will not easily give up. 

***There is a view that the United States will not go to war with China for Taiwan. This view underestimates the determination of the United States to defend its world hegemony. With the rapid rise of China, the United States has already regarded China as its number one competitor.*** Taiwan being the core trump card for the United States to check and balance China. Once the mainland regains Taiwan, the United States will not only lose the Taiwan card, but will also produce a series of domino effects. Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia may fall to China because of the US inaction. By then, the US front in the Western Pacific will be at risk of collapse. In recent years, the United States has tried to suppress China's rise by various means including tariffs, technology, finance, and diplomacy, but they have not achieved the expected results. Therefore, the possibility that the United States may adopt military measures to suppress China in the future cannot be ruled out. The United States may not go to war with China for Taiwan itself, but the United States is likely to use Taiwan as an excuse to go to war with China. A similar example is that in 1914, in order to suppress the rise of Germany, the United Kingdom directly declared war on Germany under the pretext that Germany invaded Belgium and undermined neutrality. Before that, German domestic public opinion believed that Belgium was not worthy of the British war. This strategic misjudgment led to The outbreak of World War I. 

***After regaining Taiwan, China's geopolitical situation will be greatly improved.*** The first is the economic hinterland—the southeast coast- will gain an extra barrier. By then, the East China Sea Fleet can deploy to Taiwan and extend the maritime defense zone by 500 kilometers. The land defense situation will also be improved. First of all, the Eastern Theater will no longer need to maintain the size of the three army groups. The 73rd army stationed in Fujian can be transferred to the western theater to fight against India.",1632882129.0

# **In Favor**

## **Germany:**

Another key proponent of deeper military integration is Germany. Angela Merkel herself has been backing Macron already in 2018.

Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to the European Parliament, Strasbourg, 13 November 2018^([3][4]):

>I have proposed that we establish a European Security Council with rotating member state membership, in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared. We need to create a fully capable, European military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis. We have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain. That is a good thing, and these efforts have received wide support here.
>
>Yet – and I say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years – we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper European army. Yes, that’s how things stand. Four years ago, Jean-Claude Juncker said: a joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries. That would not be an army in competition with NATO – don’t misunderstand me – but it could be an effective complement to NATO. Nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question. But, ladies and gentlemen, it would then be much easier to cooperate with us. When, as is the case at the moment, we have more than 160 defence or weapons systems and the United States has only 50 or 60, when each country needs its own administration, support and training for everything, we are not an efficient partner. If we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives, nothing speaks against us being collectively represented in NATO with a European army. I don’t see any contradiction there at all.
>
>That would then also involve ... (heckling from the floor) – I welcome that response. That doesn’t bother me. I’m used to parliament. –
>
>That, incidentally, would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within Europe. And it would also involve – this is a difficult task, also for the Federal Republic of Germany – developing a joint arms export policy, because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world.

Merkel at the signing of the France-German friendship treaty, January 2019^([5]):

> Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that a new Franco-German friendship treaty was a step toward the creation of a future joint European army.
>
>Ms Merkel said the pact aims to build a Franco-German ""common military culture"" and ""contributes to the creation of a European army"".
>
> President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Merkel signed the deal, which pledges deeper economic and defence ties as well as commitment to the EU, in the German city of Aachen.

Another part of Merkel’s speech at the signing of the Treaty of Aachen^([23]):

> We are committed to developing a common military culture, a common defence industry and a common approach to arms exports. In so doing, we intend to help to create a European army. This will only work, however, if this goes hand in hand with efforts to coordinate our foreign policy. Those who are aware of the many things that happen each day also know what it means when we commit together now to assuming foreign policy responsibility and to standing up for our interests. However, this will only work if we improve the way in which we coordinate our development policy. Our neighbouring continent of Africa is a particularly important part of this. 

German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that a “coalition of the willing” could be the way forward^([20]):

>German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the lesson from Afghanistan was that Europe must be able to ""act more independently"" to be a credible actor.
>
>But she insisted ""it is very important that we don't act as an alternative to NATO and the Americans"".
>
>She appeared to push back against the idea of a standing force, saying on Twitter that ""coalitions of the willing"" among member states could come together to tackle future crises.


## **Italy:** 


In the past Italy has proposed concepts for a European force that did go beyond Franco-German proposals for defence integration^[6]. Although it is necessary to stress that they have also emphasized at other times that their proposals have not been aiming at a European Army (as well in 2016)^([7]): 
> But Pinotti, the Italian defense minister, stressed that Rome’s proposal stopped short of calling for an EU army.
>
>“Nobody has actually talked about an EU army,” Pinotti said. “If we aim at this it is the wrong objective.”

Mario Draghi has expressed urgency regarding the need to strengthen European sovereignty and specifically European defense, but his words didn’t feel like a very concrete endorsement^([8]):

>For the Italian premier ""it is quite evident that the events of recent months are leading to a profound re-examination of the international dimension and the result can only be the strengthening of European sovereignty, one of the aspects being the strengthening of European defense. It began in a fairly explicit reflection on the organizational aspects that will keep us busy for the years to come, but to tell the truth there is not much time to wait for stability to be maintained "".

Silvio Berlusconi has stressed the need to build a common European defense several times during his career (also during his time as Prime Minister). 

His most recent remark are from the 5th of September.^([11]): 

>""Europe is powerless in the face of a tragedy like that in Afghanistan. The dream is that of the United States of the EU defended by a common army"".  

It is of course questionable how much influence he still holds within Italian politics and Forza Italia and whether his comments can be seen as representative of current trends. I would appreciate input regarding this.

Besides this also Italian general Claudio Graziano, incumbent president of the Military Committee of the European Union, expressed support and urgency^([9]):

>Geostrategic changes show that we need a stronger Europe. The situations in Afghanistan, Libya, the Middle East and the Sahel show that it is time to act, starting with the creation of a “rapid deployment force ""capable of show the will of the European Union to act as a global strategic partner. When if not now? Later it would be late,""

He has been Chief of Staff of the Italian Army and Chief of Defence Staff of the Italian Armed Forces. 

Giorgio Mulè, the Italian defense undersecretary, seems to share his opinion^([44]):

>The EU army is “a thing that must happen” said Giorgio Mulè, the Italian defense undersecretary. For him, “a group of nations” composed of the EU’s founding countries — Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg — should take the first steps.


The President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, spoke about the need to create a European army the 5th of September^([10][55]) **read in the comments**.



## **Spain:**

Pedro Sanchez, the current Prime Minister of Spain, joined the call of Macron and Merkel for a European Army in a speech before the European Parliament in January 2019^([12]):

> Honourable members in order to ensure the security of our citizens and strengthen our role as a true global power we need to act decisively determinedly in Europe on security defence slightly more than a year ago. We set up permits and in cooperation we're taking the first steps towards ensuring we have our own defence capacity. After decades of paralysis and the time has now come to be decisive in pursuit of this we need to move ahead openly towards the creation of a true European army the union honourable members must show the world that it has chosen to be a soft power if I can put it that way. It's a delicate choice. It's it's not a reflection of weakness.
> We need the capacity to project Europe beyond our borders and the political willpower to do so. Those are vital recognition vital preconditions. If we are to be a critical global player European Union is an attractive model for many parts of the world. It's our union which allows us to aspire to playing a role of global leadership. We represent the possibilities of multilateral order that's based on the law and accepted common rules Spain is prepared to play its role in assuming that leadership thanks to our privileged relationship with Latin America North Africa and the Middle East. Nonetheless given major global challenges before us Europe has far less clout than it has in other areas where the union holds an exclusive competence. And with that in mind I like to share some thoughts with you. We need to become a true global actor which we're not today. That's what we need to do away with the rule of unanimity not just in external policy but also taxation.

Spain’s top military official, Chief of Staff Teodoro López Calderón^([21]):

>Spain’s top military official, Chief of Staff Teodoro López Calderón, told El Mundo newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that the EU’s dependence on the U.S. has been “absolute” and that the bloc must develop a military force to be a relevant player on the international scene.
>
>“If not, it will never be one,” he said. “Creating a European army means having a common foreign policy and that we all share the same interests. This is a political leap that still must be achieved. But I don’t think there is any doubt that Brussels should increase its military capacity. That is one of the important consequences of what happened in Afghanistan.”

## **The Netherlands**:

The Dutch Minister of Denfense Ank Bijleveld has said in 2018 that her government opposes the establishment of a European army and that Merkel’s and Macron’s vision is going “far too far”^([13]).

She was forced to step down because of criticism regarding the evacuation of Afghanistan 10 days ago^([14]).

The incumbent Minister of Defence Henk Kamp is in office since 21.09.21.

In November of 2018 the stated position of Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, also has been in clear opposition^([28]):

> Prime Minister Mark Rutte does not feel like a European army (translator, please ). Europe cannot defend itself. That can only happen with American help, he warned.
>
>Rutte called the recent proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron unwise. “The idea goes way too far. France and Germany are really ahead of the pack with that,"" he said. 

It seems that the Afghanistan debacle has lead to a change.
 
After a meeting of Macron and Dutch Premier Minister Mark Rutte a joint declaration on the 31.08.21 read^([15]): 

>France and the Netherlands acknowledge the need for a resilient and capable Europe to take more responsibility for its own security and defence, and to allocate the necessary resources to do so. To that end, they are committed to working towards an ambitious and actionable Strategic Compass that will enhance and guide the implementation of the level of ambition on security and defence for the years to come. France and the Netherlands are committed to preserving and enhancing their close cooperation on regions of shared strategic interest such as in the Sahel, the Levant, the Gulf or the Indo-pacific. France and the Netherlands reaffirm their strong support to the European Intervention Initiative (EI2) as an efficient framework to enhance common European strategic culture.
>
>In light of the deteriorating global security and geopolitical environment, France and the Netherlands recognize that NATO is the cornerstone of the collective defence policy of both countries and, in the context of the revision of its Strategic Concept, underline that strong and effective EU-NATO cooperation is more essential than ever. France and the Netherlands recognise that both the EU and NATO can support and complement each other when it comes to the expertise and instruments at our disposal. To that end, France and the Netherlands aim to adopt an ambitious Joint Declaration on EU-NATO Cooperation in December 2021.

After a meeting of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Mark Rutte read^([16]):

>11.Common Security and Defence Policy. From a security and defence
perspective, European strategic autonomy means that the EU will enhance its
global strategic role and its capacity to act autonomously when and where
necessary and together with partners wherever possible.
The Strategic Compass will help the EU and its Member States to take the
necessary steps in order to gradually work towards fulfilling that ambition. This
includes, amongst others, closer cooperation on crisis management (including
missions and operations and the gradual reinforcement of command and
control structures), resilience, capability development and partnerships.
Further development of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and
of other European defence instruments and policies will be crucial to achieving
these objectives.
>The EU needs to achieve the necessary capabilities, while taking into account
the prior obligations undertaken by Member States, notably those
corresponding to the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. It must be
understood that a Europe that shoulders its responsibilities in the area of
defence is a Europe whose actions will strengthen NATO and its objectives.
These capabilities comprise, amongst others, the development of the
European Defence Technological and Industrial Base; the human,
technological and, above all, financial resources required to support it; and
the establishment of a clearly defined and transparent framework for relations
with third parties.  


## **Poland:**

I was very surprised to be able to include Poland on the “in favor” side of this list. As I started collecting material I was expecting to find and mostly also found content expressing worries of Poland about the often mentioned duplication of efforts and weakening of NATO through the creation of a European army.

On the 11.09.21 during a visit of Angela Merkel in Warsaw, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki gave an interview for the German newspaper FAZ^([17]):

>""Poland and the European Union must be able to protect their borders. Current events are an attempt to attack these borders, sow confusion and destabilize Poland and the EU.""
>
>""I am working closely with the Lithuanian and Latvian governments; we must and want to secure the Union's eastern border even with increased migratory pressure. The situation is all the more tense because the Russian-Belarusian maneuvers ""Zapad 2021"" have just started on the other side of the border.""
>
>""In my opinion, if the EU wants to survive, and if it wants to be strong, it must be a Union of sovereign states, a Europe of Nations, respecting each other's traditions and cultures. But at the same time it should cooperate very closely economically and **have a real European army**, which would be able to defend Europe from the south, east and north.""

This must represent a major shift in the position of Poland. His mentioning of Lithuania and Latvia could also imply, that this shift has also occurred there. They, as other Eastern European nations, have been some of the strongest opponents of common European military capabilities.

## **Portugal:**

In the past Portugal went as far as enacting a resolution against a European army^([18]).

The Portuguese Prime Minister at the time^([19]):

>""All the conditions will be explained in the resolution of the Council of Ministers that will be adopted tomorrow, namely what we have already said thirty times and will be laid out in black and white in the resolution: we do not support a European army, we do not support the principle, nor do we support it being seen as an alternative to NATO,"" said Costa.

This position seems to have changed^[43]:

> “We cannot remain adolescents forever,” said Portuguese Defense Minister João Gomes Cravinho in a recent POLITICO interview. “We have to, at a certain point, stand up and say we assume responsibilities. That time has come.”

## **Slovenia:**

Slovenia's defence minister Matej Tonin^([20]): 

>Slovenia's defence minister Matej Tonin, also speaking on behalf of the rotating EU presidency, aligned with Borrell.
>
>""This debacle in Afghanistan, also showed that, unfortunately, the EU doesn't have the necessary capability for operations in extreme circumstances,"" Tonin said.
>
>He then mentioned European battlegroups, small forces of some 1,500 troops. But their deployment requires consensus among all 27 member states, he said.
>
>""Maybe the solution is that we invent a mechanism where the classical majority will be enough and those who are willing will be able to go,"" he had said, earlier in the day.
>
>Asked who would command such troops, he said ""the institutions of the European Union.""

Prime Minister Janez Janša at the 16th Bled Strategic Forum (01.09.21-02.09.21), titled “the Future of Europe”^([21]):

>When asked by the moderator about migrations and the European Union's soft and hard power, he said that the EU's soft power was not enough and that hard power was also necessary. He highlighted that EU aid to poor countries often fails to reach those who need it most because a safe environment is not guaranteed. In his opinion, soft power is also not enough to ensure a safe environment, particularly after what has happened in Afghanistan. ""We see that the United States will no longer get involved with the actions of failing countries around the world,"" he said. He said that hard power and how to bring hard power into European politics is one of the most important issues in the debate on the future of Europe. In his words, the crisis area at this moment is not only Afghanistan, drawing attention in particular to the Sahel region in Africa. ""This is our immediate neighbourhood with 400 million people, a third of whom are ready to leave these countries,"" he said.To be effective in terms of soft power, the EU also needs hard power, ""otherwise we are just spending money and arguing with each other."" He also stressed that the European countries did not want to repeat the mistake that was made in 2015 regarding the expected wave of migration. ""Not a single EU member state wants to repeat the experience of 2015 or the open borders policy, as happened in 2015 after the Syrian crisis.""


## **Hungary:**

Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó^([22]):

>“Hungary supports the affirmation of European defence cooperation”, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó declared at a press conference in Brussels to mark a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers.
>
>“The Hungarian Government supports the preparations for the plan on the establishment of a joint European army and the goal of making Europe capable of operating and performing peace-making and peacekeeping missions in neighbouring regions”, Mr. Szijjártó explained.
Viktor Orban called already in 2016 for the creation of a European army^([24]).

## **Sweden:**

Sweden has historically been opposed.

But it has also been part of EI2 and has hosted the annual ministerial meeting of the initiative on the 24.09.21 in Stockholm^([39]), where the 13 defence ministers also “shared important lessons so far identified after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, including views on the implications for European coordination and capability requirements, and for transatlantic cooperation.”^([40]).

“At the margins of the meeting, a bilateral agreement on defence cooperation between Sweden and Portugal was signed.”^([41]) 

The statement also mentioned concrete objectives^([38]):

>Aim
>We intend to enhance the bilateral dialogue on defence matters, with the aim to increase the understanding and co-operation between us, the Armed Forces and defence agencies and to identify further opportunities for cooperation on defence in the EU and in other multilateral arrangements including in NATO.

Among the objectives “European Defence Co-operation (including EU Common Security and Defence Policy);”^([38]). 

This could also be understood as mostly of bilateral nature; the announcement regarding further development of the defence cooperation between France and Sweden on the same day (24.09.21) was much clearer in its language^([42]): 

>As global commons, such as space, cyber, sea and air domains, become more and more contested, European countries must jointly defend their interests and values, and international law. This is our duty if we are to maintain security, freedom of access and navigation. We must act together because no one will do so on our behalf.
>
>European countries, together with our transatlantic partners, must meet these challenges together. In the aftermath of the events in Afghanistan we need to have an open and frank political dialogue on the lessons learned on international engagements and global commitments. Our credibility is linked to a strong political will and military capacity to act, combined with our ability to coordinate with our allies and partners. In this context, we cannot afford to leave the scene to terrorist organisations or to state actors who contest the international rules-based order. The security of Europe is first and foremost the responsibility of Europeans themselves. Europe’s security should strengthen European strategic autonomy in a way that directly benefits transatlantic and global security.

Interestingly also a specific model seems to be favored^([42]):

>As close partners committed to trust, transparency and cooperation, France and Sweden are coordinating their upcoming presidencies of the Council of the EU in the areas of crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships. We firmly believe that the EU and NATO are complementary partners in a transatlantic security web that includes other forms of bilateral, multilateral, and regional cooperation that vary in purpose and geographic scope. We are prepared to consider how regional groups of Member States could assume regional responsibility and act on behalf of the EU in a more flexible and reactive manner, building on the model of the Takuba Task Force.

At the same time this joint statement also provides one of the best insights into the agenda and direction the EI2 meeting in Stockholm took^([42]):

>Today, we will meet with Defence Ministers from the European Intervention Initiative, EI2, in Stockholm. We will discuss how like-minded European partners can achieve more together and ways to improve cooperation and common efforts. EI2 is an effective incubator and catalyst  for concrete efforts, gathering the political and military communities of our countries. In this regard, France and Sweden are firmly committed to promoting international law and upholding the European security, with Europe assuming its responsibilities as a security provider and through a strong, balanced and mutually beneficial transatlantic relationship.

>Minister for Defence, France

>Peter Hultqvist

**Edit: Change of position due to new information**

## **Greece:**

Greece just recently (28.09.21) bought three new french frigates. Both Macron and Greek Prime Minister Mitosotakis stressed a focus on European defence in this context^([43]):

>PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Europe needs to stop being naive when it comes to defending its interests and build its own military capacity, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday after Greece sealed a deal for French frigates worth about 3 billion euros ($3.51 billion).
>""The Europeans must stop being naive. When we are under pressure from powers, which at times harden (their stance) , we need to react and show that we have the power and capacity to defend ourselves. Not escalating things, but protecting ourselves,"" Macron told a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
>""This isn't an alternative to the United States alliance. It's not a substitution, but to take responsibility of the European pillar within NATO and draw the conclusions that we are asked to take care of our own protection.""
>Under Tuesday's agreement Athens agreed to buy three frigates with an option to buy a fourth for about 3 billion euros, a Greek government source told Reuters.
>The accord, part of a broader strategic military and defence cooperation pact, comes after Athens had already ordered some 24 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets this year, making it the first European Union country to buy the fighter jet.
>
>""This will tie us for decades,"" Mitsotakis said. ""This opens the door to the Europe of tomorrow that is strong and autonomous, capable of defending its interests.""

## **General**
 
11 EU states (and Norway and the UK) are currently part of EI2, the initiative for a joint European military intervention force outside of the European Union and NATO, which might be an indication that it is possible that they would be in favor (although only a weak one, as the needed concessions differ vastly). 

**EU Participants of EI2**: 

Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Italy

**Then there is of course the list of the 14 European countries, that have proposed the rapid military response force in the first place^([45]):** 

Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.

This list might provide the best glimpse of the current state of clear support for the endeavor, although it doesn’t really help to grasp what countries are strongly opposed or still on the fence. I am sure that if any other countries would have been in strong support of the motion, they would have been included (although the recent language of many state representatives seems to suggest that many have changed there stance recently).

A European Army is also part of the official program of the EPP^([46]), the largest party in the Commission as well as in the EUCO. The group has also expressed support publicly^([47]).

Manfred Weber, the leader of the EPP, said on the 12.09.21^([48]):

>The national armies, of course, remain the main pillars of defense. But, step by step, we need to build European capacities, such as a European reaction force with a few thousand men. And we also need a cyber-defense brigade,

The Council itself seems to agree with the general approach and the direction the Commission is advancing^([49]):

> The EU wants to **strengthen the global competitiveness and innovation capacity** of the Union's **defence technological and industrial base**. On 19 November 2018, the Council adopted its position (partial general approach) on the **European Defence Fund** proposed by the European Commission in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027.
>
>On 13 June 2018, the European Commission presented its proposal for a regulation of the European Defence Fund as part of the upcoming MFF with a proposed envelope of €13 billion. The European Defence Fund aims to **foster innovation** and **allow economies of scale in defence research** and in the **industrial development phase** by supporting collaborative projects.
>
>In its partial general approach, the Council broadly agrees with the Commission proposal. In particular, it confirms the overall objectives and structure of the Fund, including the intention to **invest in disruptive technologies**. It mostly seeks to clarify a number of aspects in regards to the **eligibility of entities**, and **ownership of the results**. It also seeks to clarify the award procedures and criteria and the provisions concerning the share of the indirect costs that will be covered by the Fund, the latter being an important element **to make the Fund more attractive for industry players**. The Council further stresses that **special attention will be paid to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and mid-caps** in the Union.
>
>The approach adopted today is labelled as ""partial"" as the financial and other horizontal aspects of the fund will depend on the overall agreement on the next multiannual financial framework.

(Emphasis not mine)

# **Opposition**

## **Czech Republic:**

Prime Minister Sobotka has called for the creation of an EU Army in 2016^([50]), but current Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has expressed his strong opposition in 2019^([51]):

> Recently, there have also been calls for the creation of a European army that might replace NATO in the future. I strongly disagree with that. I really do not want a European Commissioner to direct Europe’s defence and to address security threats in a similarly chaotic and improvising manner, such as saving the euro area. NATO is a proven and functional organization that can plan, do logistics, and has established management channels. None of this must be questioned. Within the EU, we can only better coordinate 
arms purchases, but it will not be easy, because every country will want to protect its defence companies. 
>
> “I don’t think it’s time after Afghanistan to start opening discussions on the future of the European army,” said Jan Havránek, the Czech Republic’s deputy minister of defense. “I mean these are buzzwords.”

In general the Czech  Republic seems on a EU skeptic course recently.

An interesting fact is though, that the Czech Republic has signed the push for the “initial entry force”^([45]). 

## **Latvia:**

Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma in 2015^([52]): 

>""There is a possibility it could be discussed in July at the European Council, but it's important to check whether this might be duplicating NATO,"" Straujuma told Latvian public broadcaster LTV.

Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister of Latvia Artis Pabriks^([53]):

>Latvian minister Artis Pabriks said the bloc needed to show it had the ""political will"" to use any force if the plan was to lead anywhere.
>
>He noted that the battlegroups programme has been around for over a decade as part of the EU's common defence policy, but asked, ""Have we ever used it?""


At the same time there seem also to be ongoing efforts to develop a common foreign policy with the EU and France. Rihards Kols (National Alliance), chairman of the Saeima Foreign Affairs Committee said during a meeting with representatives of the French Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs (22.09.2021)^([36]):

 >""The EU cannot afford a nearsighted policy. An effective strategy is needed to prevent that. This requires higher efficiency and also a principled common foreign policy that would ensure continuity and reduce the bloc's dependence on various election cycles,"" the Saeima press service quoted Kols as saying. 
> 
>""Although our priorities, just like our geographical location and related geopolitical risks, may be somewhat different, we see that our French colleagues have an understanding and in-depth knowledge of the challenges we are facing here in the Baltic states. Close cooperation based on a clear strategy will help strengthen these ties also in the future,"" Kols said following the meeting.  

## **Austria:**

Historically Austria has been against a common European defence due to their policy of neutrality and not wanting to hand over command to the EU. In November 2016 former Federal Chancellor Christian Kern of the SPÖ^([26]) and the then acting Minister of Defense^[26] at the time held almost identical views as the incumbent Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz^([26]):

> While acknowledging the disruptive force the US election result is likely to have on the EU and the need to forge something of a European revival, the theme of security and defence policy has been more or less absent in their discussions so far.
>
>Austria has remained neutral for the last 61 years and joining the then-European Economic Community was not possible in the 1980s because of its stance on the Cold War.
>
>As relations with Moscow thawed and the USSR collapsed, accession talks began in earnest. The issue of neutrality never emerged as an issue during the negotiations and it has remained an almost sacred aspect of Austrian foreign policy, as demonstrated by opinion polls.
>
>In practice, of course, Austria still participated in political and humanitarian efforts in the Balkans and other missions as part of the NATO Partnership for Peace, of which it is a member. But when it comes to the EU and defence, this is an entirely different matter.
> Austrian political reaction has been expectedly negative. The country’s Chancellor, Christian Kern, has indicated that he cannot imagine the Austrian army being under the control of a non-Austrian high command. For Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil, the idea of an EU army is incompatible with the country’s neutrality and he has therefore outright rejected it.
>
>As much as Austria’s two main parties, the SPÖ and ÖVP, would like to have different opinions on the issue, there actually appears to be a consensus between the coalition partners. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has confirmed that he is against any measure that goes against Austria’s neutral stance, so a common European army has not even been discussed.
>
>Even for the chalk-and-cheese presidential candidates, Alexander van der Bellen and Norbert Hofer, opposing an EU army is a uniting factor.
>
>There are, of course, voices that are not so fierce in their opposition to the idea. Vice-Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner said that an EU army could be an option that would prove necessary, which is a view that is shared by the country’s European Commissioner, Johannes Hahn, and the ÖVP’s European Parliament fraction chief, Otmar Karas.

In June 2020 Kurz reaffirmed his opinion^([27]):

> Kurz said Austria was in favour of “close cooperation among EU countries” but not a European army, while stressing the need to “ensure stability on the (EU’s) southern and eastern borders.”

An interesting fact is though, that Austria has signed the push for the “initial entry force”^([45]).   

## **Malta:**

Prime Minister Robert Abela, 16.09.21^([30]):

>Questioned about the EU commission president’s emphasis on the need to introduce an EU-wide military force during a state of the union speech, Abela said Malta would stick to its neutrality obligations as enshrined in the constitution. 

## **Denmark:**

On September 22nd, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, said “she did not believe a new security pact between Australia, Britain and the United States that excluded France and cost Paris a defence project was grounds for a transatlantic dispute.”, breaking ranks with Germany, other European member states and EU institutions^([31]):

>""I think it is important to say, in relation to the discussions that are taking place right now in Europe, that I experience Biden as being very loyal to the transatlantic alliance,"" Frederiksen told Danish daily Politiken from New York, where she was attending the United Nations General Assembly.
>
>""And I think in general that one should refrain from lifting some specific challenges, which will always exist between allies, up to a level where they are not supposed to be. I really, really want to warn against this,"" she added.

“Asked whether she can understand the French criticism, Frederiksen replied: “No, I cannot. I do not understand that at all.”^([31][32])



She also stated that she would ""go up against those who try to undermine transatlantic cooperation""^([33][54]):

>Asked about Mr Macron's plans for the EU to operate more independently on defence issues, Ms Frederiksen told Politiken, a Danish broadsheet: ""I would also like to say quite clearly that I will at all times go up against those who try to undermine transatlantic cooperation - whether it happens in Europe or at home in Denmark.
>
>“The most important, stand-alone explanation for the fact that Danes, Europeans and Americans have been able to live in safety and security for decades is the transatlantic cooperation that grew out of the ashes of the world wars. 
>
>""It is, by volume, the strongest alliance for democracy and freedom and fundamental human rights, and it must not be undermined by thoughts of a stronger Europe at the expense of strong transatlantic cooperation.”

Many British newspapers have horribly editorialized the title and the context of her words. Yes, she expressed opposition, but no Denmark did not “vow to resist Emmanuel Macron's EU army plans”.   

She stated:

> ""I think it is important to say - in relation to the discussions that are taking place right now in Europe - that I experience Biden as very loyal to the transatlantic alliance. And I think, on the whole, that one should refrain from lifting some concrete challenges, which will always be between allies, up to something that it should not be. I really, really want to warn against that, ""says Mette Frederiksen to Politiken.


 
## **Estonia:**

“To date, Estonia is the only country on NATO’s eastern flank to join the French-led European Intervention Initiative.”^([34]) 
Having said that, they seem to have been historically opposed to the idea just as other Baltic leaders^([37]).

## **Lithuania:**

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda expressed on the 01.04.20 his worry about a duplication of NATO capabilities^([35]):
>Talks of a separate EU defence system are raising special concern and would lead to confusion as it would duplicate NATO, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said on March 10 while addressing participants of the Bucharest Nine meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius. In the middle of 2018, nine EU member states, including the United Kingdom which left the EU in January, backed France's proposed initiative to establish a European defence group. 

As other Baltic nations, they have been critical of common Euroepan capabilities in the past^([37]), but it remains to be seen, whether the erosion of trust and confidence in the United States due to the Afghanistan debacle  in combination with increased insecurity because of the recent Russian Zapad-21 military exercise close to the borders have changed minds in Riga, Tallin, and Vilnus.

In Syria, they're fighting a proxy war against Russia (although, if I'm not mistaken, it's not unlikely that Turkish and Russian troops/artillery have engaged each other).  Yet simultaneously, they are p\*ssing the US off by... buying S-400s.

Now things aren't all rosy with the US, besides the S-400s.  Their assault on Syrian Kurdish positions (and Iraqi Kurdish positions, although maybe this is a \*little\* less touchy) probably doesn't make us that happy.  Or the awkward situation in Libya, where Turkey backs the UN-backed government, but opposes America's allies (Egypt, for example, a Haftar ally).  Obviously, the US position here is not ""clear cut"", but it is at least obvious they are grinding American gears.

With all of this in mind, it \*appears\* that Turkey is just digging their hole deeper.  De facto exclusion from the EU (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon), their proxy war with Russia, their jihadist allies in Syria looking extremely bad,  their constant p\*ssing off the US, PLUS the continuing ""defeats"" of political Islam (ie the coup situation in Tunisia, the loss of political Islam in Morocco), it seems like just about everything is going wrong for Turkey.

I know they have recently started to politically reconcile with Egypt+Gulf states, but this seems like the start to something slow, not something with immediate political payoffs.  So even with this in mind, the above ""between a rock and many hard places"" situation still seems an appropriate description.

Contrast this with Qatar, a nation who has pushed similar geopolitical goals, but seems to be doing politically fine - they have situated themselves as a interlocutor with the Taliban, they have started to make good progress on ""detente"" with Egypt+Gulf states, and the US doesn't hate them (afaik).  And Russia doesn't seem to hate them either.  I know they have the benefit of not-being-a-Syrian-neighbor, but still, with Qatar in mind, Turkey seems really confusing.

And now they are purchasing more S-400s - that's fine and all, national sovereignty, etc etc.  But geopolitically it seems like the actions of a madman.  What exactly is Erdogan trying to accomplish?  From my naive perspective, this all seems like he is just digging the hole deeper.  But I feel like it can't be \*that\* obvious, there must be some consideration I have left out.  Or is he really just a madman, going crazy with concerns about inflation and central bankers?",1632796386.0

Why is the attention of the country's leadership focused exactly right now on the ""warming"" in relations with Turkey, when there are a lot of other acute problems? What is the reason of hurry?

Erdogan and Aliyev do not intend to make concessions since they are not currently the losing side. What can turn the situation in favor of Armenia? The answer is simple: multilateral pressure on Turkey on the issue of recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

&#x200B;

For Armenia, a more reasonable and advantageous option is to hold any negotiations with a centuries-old enemy on the terms of equality, and not fawning.

Today, the recognition of the Genocide by the United Kingdom, Israel and the 50th US state of Mississippi is crucial, that will entail a wave of recognition of this atrocity by states around the globe.

According to the information of the Armenian National Committee in the UK, published in July on the initiative of a member of the Labour Party, John Spellar, a bill on the recognition of the Genocide has been submitted to the British Parliament. According to the organization, the bill will be presented in the second reading and discussed in the House of Commons on December 10, 2021. The bill was inexplicably postponed for six months. Most likely, in anticipation of the Armenian-Turkish ""denouement"".

Monuments to the victims of the Genocide have been erected in Cardiff and in Wales. And that's fine. But they do not give significant support to Armenia in defending its own interests, and Turkey and Azerbaijan continue to remain unpunished.

It is advisable for the Armenian government to adopt approaches that will not jeopardize the country's supreme interests and its future.",1632552492.0

This is a summary about the current situation of nuclear weapons in the Indo-Pacific region, and after that, there is a discussion about how it affects the military strategies of the relevant countries.

# NUCLEAR STATES IN INDO-PACIFIC

**CHINA** has successfully tested their nuclear device, Project 596, at Lop Nur test site in 1964. In 1967, their first successful test of a hydrogen bomb occurred, also in the open air of Lop Nur. Currently, they are estimated by SIPRI to [own 350 warheads](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/yb21_10_wnf_210613.pdf), and their newest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), DF-41, is estimated to have a [range of 12000-15000 km](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/df-41/), enough to cover everywhere on Earth except southern South America and some part of Antarctica.

**INDIA** has successfully tested their nuclear device in 1974 at an underground shaft under Pokhran Test Range, where a hydrogen bomb was also successfully tested in 1998. Currently, they are estimated to [own 156 warheads](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/yb21_10_wnf_210613.pdf), and their newest ICBM, Agni-V, is estimated to have a [range of 5000-8000 km](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/agni-5/), enough to cover China and Pakistan, and also Moscow if the range is truly 8000 km.

**PAKISTAN** has successfully tested their nuclear device in 1998, as a response to India's nuclear test a few weeks earlier. Currently, they are estimated to [own 165 warheads](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/yb21_10_wnf_210613.pdf). They are not believed to have ICBM capability, so their nuclear warheads can only be used in the vicinity (i.e. towards India). Beijing is about 4000 km away from Pakistan, and is out of range.

**NORTH KOREA** had their first detectable nuclear test in 2006, which had the minuscule yield of about 1 kiloton. American spy plane seemed to detect radioactive xenon near the shaft, confirming the authenticity of the test, but some people still believed that North Korea was detonating ammonium nitrate in the shaft. The 2017 hydrogen bomb test, which had a yield of about 100 kiloton, cleared most suspicion. Currently, estimating by the amount of enriched uranium they produced, they probably have [40-50 warheads](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/yb21_10_wnf_210613.pdf). Their newest ICBM, Hwasong-15, is estimated to have a [range of 8500-13000 km](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/hwasong-15-kn-22/), enough to hit America. There are doubts whether they can miniaturize a warhead enough to fit it on an ICBM.

# NUCLEAR LATENT STATES IN INDO-PACIFIC

Nuclear latent states are states who have the technology and know-how to produce a weapon, without actually producing one. [A more-in-depth explanation of nuclear latency can be read here](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/exploring-nuclear-latency).

**JAPAN** is the epitome of a nuclear latent state. They have a vibrant civilian nuclear industry, which is the reason why they have [1800 kg of highly enriched uranium in their inventory](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/civilian-heu-japan/). Also, their successful lineage of solid-fuel space rockets (including M-V rocket and Epsilon) can be easily converted into ICBM technology. On the other hand, their constitution has de facto prohibited the use of strictly offensive weapons like the ICBM, and the Japanese population is strongly against nuclear weapons.

**SOUTH KOREA** and **TAIWAN** both had pursued their own nuclear programs in the Cold War, but the US ""convinced"" them not to make the bomb. Indeed, [Taiwan was one or two years away from the bomb](https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/133hersman.pdf) before the US intervened. As for delivery, they don't need more than a medium range ballistic missile to hit their adversaries. Finally, given that both states are under existential threat by nuclear states, they would rush to build the nuke if they were allowed to.

**AUSTRALIA** is a curious case. They don't operate any nuclear power plants (because they have so much coal), but they do have uranium mines. And given their wealth and status as a highly industrialized country, many believe that Australia is nuclear-latent. However, delivery is a problem; Beijing is 6000 km away from the northern tip of Australia, and other nuclear states are even farther away. Also, Australia has neither ICBM capability nor a space program. [The only way of delivery is submarine](https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-one-conclusive-reason-why-australia-won-t-go-nuclear-20180918-p504hz.html) (hmmmmm). As for public opinion, in 2010, [63% of the people was strongly against having a nuclear weapon](https://poll.lowyinstitute.org/charts/nuclear-weapons-in-australia/). Things have changed drastically since 2010, though.

# DISCUSSION

**THE NECESSITY OF INDIA IN AN ANTI-CHINA STRATEGY** cannot be more obvious; India is the only nuclear state in the region not aligned with China. Since India is not a Pacific country, the term ""Indo-Pacific"" is used to lump India with the other Pacific countries. This also explains why India deserves to be a member of the Quad, as a peer of the United States, Japan, and Australia.

**AUSTRALIA PURCHASING NUCLEAR SUBMARINES** signifies a 180-degree turn in Australian nuclear policy, as Australia goes from a nuclear-power-free country to a country that burns highly enriched uranium for power (all US submarines burn highly enriched uranium for efficiency and such submarines have no need to refuel). This move will certainly alienate New Zealand, one of Australia's closest allies, as [New Zealand prohibits nuclear vessels in their waters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/16/aukus-submarines-banned-as-pact-exposes-divide-between-new-zealand-and-western-allies), but Australia seems to feel so threatened that they no longer care about what New Zealand thinks. At the same time, if French diplomats think this is about money and national dignity, then they are so (excuse my French) naïve; changes in nuclear policy are usually not announced until the last minute, since everything nuclear should be top secret.

**THE US CANNOT AFFORD TO PULL OUT FROM THE PACIFIC** since, as discussed above, the American guarantee of security is what stops South Korea from developing nukes. Many Asia-Pacific states lack strategic depth, and if they think the US will no longer protect them, nukes will be their only resort, and a nuclear arms race will start.

**THE US NEEDS A TRUSTWORTHY NUCLEAR ALLY IN THE REGION** because the US cannot keep protecting East Asia forever. However, the US's East Asian allies cannot help feeling more and more insecure as they do not have nukes. The answer is to have an Asian nuclear ally in the region to lead the non-nuclear states. India is not a trustworthy ally of the US; as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, it is clear that India has different agendas from the US. Can South Korea be the one? No, [just look at how the THAAD crisis ended](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/did-south-koreas-three-noes-matter-not-so-much/). Also, stationing nukes within 1000 km of Beijing is insensitive. That leaves one single option for the US.

**Submission statement:**

According to the New York Times, the former advisor to the government in the Catalan region of Spain, Josep Lluís Alay, was in contact with stakeholders in Moscow to gain their support for the independence movement. Many of the people he was meeting with are involved in the Kremlin's intelligence community including the ones involved in hybrid warfare. In one text message conversation that the Times had obtained, Mr. Alay wrote “We’re working for The Americans,” in reference to the KGB spies who inspired the television show. Mr. Alay was in contact with them. Furthermore, he has advised his circle to avoid making statements about Russia that might anger the government in order to maintain its support. In public, they conduct themselves as pro-EU. 

Among the most concerning is Russia's GRU unit 29155 which is responsible for carrying out sabotage and assassination operations. This unit is responsible for various incidents such as the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, and several explosions in the Czech Republic and Serbia.  According to both articles, members of the unit were present in Spain during October 2017. Their activity is still being investigated, but according to the French intelligence, the unit had a safe house in the French Pyrenees and made trips on land to avoid detection.  They were in Barcelona in October 2017. 

These articles are worth reading and discussing since it indicates that Russia is actively involved in Spain compared to other EU countries. Unlike what is happening with the US, Germany, France, or the UK where Russia uses misinformation to destabilize elections and increase polarization through digital means, Moscow seems more intent on being involved in the potential breakup of a member EU state to further their goal of destabilizing the EU and NATO.

On the surface, it looks like both countries are hostile to one another. Saudi Arabia is one of several countries that refuses to recognise the state of Israel. Saudi Arabia even sent troops to fight against Israel in the 1948 Arab Israeli war and the 1973 Yom Kippur war. However, in recent years it appears as if Saudi Arabia's stance on Israel has begun to shift. There have been reports that intelligence officials in both countries have communicated and collaborated with one another. When both the UAE and Bahrain normalised relations with Israel last year, Saudi Arabia did not object at all. In fact IIRC, Saudi Arabia even allowed a flight from Israel to the UAE to enter its airspace.

What is the relationship overall between Saudi Arabia and Israel? Are both countries allies or enemies? If they are allies, when did this transition from being enemies to allies occur, and what caused this transition?

pl1jbz,Moscow and New Delhi in the shadow of Beijing and Washington,460,0.97,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/pl1jbz/moscow_and_new_delhi_in_the_shadow_of_beijing_and/,81,"In [this analysis](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/07/india-russia-modi-putin-geopolitics-china-pakistan-afghanistan-brics/), published in Foreign Policy, C. Raja Mohan takes a look at the shifting relation between Moscow and New Delhi. He gives an overview of past, present and how things might develop in the future. Mohan ""is the director of the National University of Singapore’s Institute of  South Asian Studies and a former member of India’s National Security  Advisory Board.""

Past:  
Since the 1950s India has maintained good relations with the, then, Soviet Union to act as a counterweight to US and UK relations with Pakistan. India pursued a strategy of non-alignment during the cold war. The SU also used their veto power on Kashmir issues. This relationship also translated into a number of arms deals. After the collapse of the SU, while slightly improving relations with Washington, India was ""hedging its bets and hold\[ing\] on to the Moscow partnership."" In the 1990s Russia launched a trilateral forum with India and China that eventually blossomed into the BRICS.  
Today:  
The increasing assertiveness of a rising China causes serious concern in New Delhi, but is seen as the best bet towards multi-polarity in Moscow. ""India continues to participate in the BRICS group and other multilateral forums dominated by Russia and China, without any anxiety about open differences with the former and ongoing conflicts with the latter. At the same time, New Delhi is pushing vigorously to strengthen the Quad framework."" This is a shift from non-alignment to what the author considers ""an unapologetic pursuit of an interest-based foreign policy."" While improving relations with Western powers India is also suffering setbacks in its neighborhood.Recent events in Afghanistan are further straining relations between India and Russia. While Moscow desires stability and sees the new administration as the most likely to achieve this, India is deeply concerned about growing Pakistani influence.  
\[Added info\] Russian arms exports have decreased by 22% from 2016-2020. While increasing exports to Algeria, China and Egypt, 90% of the drop are attributed to India reducing Russian arms imports by 53% ([Sipri, 2021](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/international-arms-transfers-level-after-years-sharp-growth-middle-eastern-arms-imports-grow-most)). \[/end\]  
Russia is trying to normalize relations between Beijing and New Delhi through formats like BRICS and is trying to keep good relations with India through new top level communication channels but the author thinks that ""the conflict \[...\] is now deeply structural; diplomatic Band-Aids are not going to fix the problem.""  
Future:  
The author notes that this new complex mechanic between Russia and India is due to their respective relations with Beijing and Washington. This and Russian cooperation with Pakistan on Afghanistan is likely to further the rift between Moscow and New Delhi.

I think the author presents a plausible case and was wondering how deeply Russian and Indian economies are intertwined and how reliant Indian defense still is on Russian arms, even when we have already seen efforts to address this possible security risk.

India being a democracy, the Modi government is also more accountable to public opinion. I must admit that Indian internals are hard for me to understand sometimes. How is the public perception of Russia, is the recent divergence of interests noticed?

I was also hoping to gain some opinions on how big the rift between the two could possibly become. Russia being in an ""uneasy alliance"" with China it relies, and will probably continue to rely, on India as a counterweight. But could increased Russian involvement with Pakistan or an increasingly dominant China lead to adversarial relations between New Delhi and Moscow? Could India ""trade"" the Russian veto for the US veto on Kashmir or is it no longer relevant?

pl1sxm,Militarily Significant Geographical Features 101,120,0.98,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/pl1sxm/militarily_significant_geographical_features_101/,33,"**An introduction to the militarily significant of various geographical features:**

Note: I'm writing this post as 'lecture notes' for myself. I don't claim to be an expert on any of this stuff. Feel free to add features/details I missed. I'll happily edit the post and credit you. Maybe we can create a useful resource for the community.

Key geographical features with military significance:

* **Overland difficult/impassable terrain:** As the name suggests, this terrain is difficult or impossible to traverse with land based military units. Mountains, rivers, deserts, forests, jungles and snow are all examples of difficult or impassable terrain. Attacking across this terrain in numbers is very difficult, and so territory across from this kind of terrain does not need to be defended as heavily. Its expensive and time consuming to build transport infrastructure through this terrain, and insofar as this infrastructure does exists it becomes a chokepoint (see below). As pointed out by u/Aniket2297 some terrain like forests and jungles can also produce food and cover ideal for sustaining and hiding guerilla forces. Additionally, as pointed out by u/Harmonic_Strategy seasonal climate variation can alter the degree to which some terrains are traversable, effectively constraining the timeframe for military operations.
   * E.g: Large portions of the Himalayas are impassable, relieving China and India from the need to militarize those parts of their borders.
* **Overland choke points:** Choke points funnel movement of land troops into small areas where only a small fraction of units are in effective range. This allows a defender to hold the choke point with a much smaller numbers (the movie '300' dramatizes this effect). Choke points can be created naturally such as when difficult/impassable terrain flanks a narrow passage (e.g. mountains on either side of a valley), or can be man made such as when infrastructure like roads, bridges, and tunnels cross difficult terrain - such chokepoints can be tactically destroyed to turn the terrain back into difficult/impassable terrain.
   * E.g. During WWII Switzerland rigged many of its mountain passes and tunnels with explosives giving them an option to effectively shut down a land invasion through those passes.
   * E.g. Afghanistan is the 'graveyard of empires' in large part because its mountainous terrain is full chokepoints that even a small guerilla force can abuse to control movement.
* **Traversable terrain:** Easily traversable terrain such as open plains allows relatively easy transport of land based armies, especially if they are mechanized. Even the destruction of roads does not have a large effect in these environments. In these environments, large armies can more fully utilize their numbers advantage.
   * E.g. The plains around Russia's population centers have historically been used as invasion routes. Today Russia maintains one of the largest tank armies in the world to effectively fight in this environment - its goal in a war is to push outside of its territory and hold the choke points between the mountains and the seas - this would effectively reduce the area it has to defend by a factor of ten. 
* **Land size:** Large land masses provide what military planners call 'strategic depth'. The deeper you go into enemy territory the harder the invasion becomes because supply chains become longer and more vulnerable, the more hostile land you have to cover with air assets and missiles, the easier reinforcements become for the defender etc. The defender also has more places to disperse and hide military infrastructure like command and control, nukes etc.
* **Arable land:** Large sections of arable land can support large populations from which militaries draw their budgets. If a country's arable land cannot support its population, it must rely on imports to feed itself. This lack of 'food security' dictates a military strategy designed to prevent a blockade.
* **Fresh water:** As with food security, countries must secure their sources of fresh water. Rivers are of particular interest because they often cross borders. A country's military is often tasked with building the capability to secure the source of a key river when it falls outside of a country's borders, or in an unstable region within the country. This is doubly true if the river is dammed - essentially giving another country control over a fresh water source. 
   * E.g. Ethiopia is building a dam on the Nile river, which has triggered military posturing from many downriver countries - especially Egypt.
   * E.g. China's interest in Tibet can be explained in part by the fact that much of China's fresh water originates in the region.
* **Seas/oceans:** A large scale invasion across water - an amphibious assault - is one of the hardest and riskiest military operations there are. This is doubly true across large oceans - such an operation requires a blue water navy (which very few countries have), sea lift capability, long maritime supply chains, and an appropriate landing beach at the destination. Because these beaches can be identified in advance they can also be fortified. Distance over water also provides a kind of strategic depth. Water is also a very effective medium for trade (over ten times cheaper than road).
* **Navigable rivers:** Navigable rivers play a large role in producing a country's wealth. Navigable rivers essentially act as an extension of the oceans, allowing cost effective maritime supply chains to extend inland. They also allow cheap trade between riverside cities. Since they have two banks, they service twice the amount of land as coasts. They are also unaffected by tides or storm surges. When a non-navigable river goes through arable land (such as in the case of the Ganges River) it produces large but poor populations. 
* **Natural harbors:** Can be transformed into naval bases. Can provide deep anchorage for larger ships in the event of an invasion.
* **Ice:** Seasonally blocks overland and maritime lanes / ports, potentially land-locking a country.
   * E.g. Most of Russia's ports freeze over in the winter. Russia maintains the world's largest fleet of icebreakers to mitigate the effect of ice.
* **Warm water:** When a port is accessible year-round it is called a warm water port.
   * E.g. Russia's intervention in Syria and its annexation of Crimea are partially explained by its need to secure access to warm water ports.
* **Shallow water:** Shallow water cannot be entered into by larger ships and make it harder for submarines to hide.
* **Small Islands:** Nations take an important interest in strategically positioned islands as outposts for sensors. Islands also project the nations borders and exclusive economic zone.
   * E.g. Iceland's position between Russia and the US makes it an ideal outpost for ballistic missile warning systems.
   * E.g. E.g. France's claim on the +100 islands of French Guinea gives it an exclusive economic zone in the Pacific that is larger than that of mainland Europe. This gives France a huge claim on maritime natural resources.
* **Island nations:** Island nations rely on maritime trade for most of what they don't produce locally. This dictated the need for a navy as well as alliances that can secure maritime trade. Note: Some non-island nations can also succumb to this effect if they are surrounded by enough difficult or impassable terrain on their land borders - in effect they are 'island-like'.
   * E.g. Throughout history the UK was a great naval power because it lived in waters that it had to defend from a blockade.
   * E.g. Japan is undergoing a transition to a blue water navy to ensure its security in the face of China's naval rise. This also binds Japan's interests to those of the US - the dominant naval power in the world - on which Japan relies for support.
   * E.g. While China is not an Island, it is largely surrounded by difficult terrain and therefore reliant on maritime trade for many goods i.e. roughly 80% of China's oil is imported.
* **Maritime choke points:** These are commonly created by straits (e.g. Hormuz, Malacca, Bab El Mandeb, Gibraltar) or canals (e.g. Suez, Panama) and produce a similar effect with naval units as overland choke points cause with land units.
   * E.g. Most of China's trade comes through the Strait of Malacca, making it very vulnerable to a naval blockade.

Together these factors can explain part of the power of nations. The US is a superpower in part because it has the largest and most productive contiguous piece of arable land in the world (the Mississippi Basin). This land gives it tremendous food security, and has allowed the US to support a huge population. The Mississippi basin is interconnected by a network of navigable rivers larger than that found in the rest of world combined, and connected to much of the east coast by a large number of ports built in natural harbors. The cost effectiveness of trade over water has made the US's population very wealthy, and politically integrated - preventing the country from fracturing into different countries. It is protected by oceans on either side, deserts and mountains to the south and lakes and forests to the north. Furthermore, its two neighbors' geographies do not support large populations, ensuring the US's supremacy on its continent of North America. With its homeland secure, its military can be highly expeditionary. Since its only threat can come from overseas, defending the approach to the US (as well as its involvement in the world in general) necessitates a blue water navy, and it's wealth affords it the most powerful navy in the world.",1631206771.0

However, it has a relatively large GDP for its population and it's known that Sweden is one of the most developed countries in the world. Besides, it has been described as the most important country of the Nordic Countries, due to its population (which is the largest among these countries) and its historic relative importance.

I was wondering what countries (preferably inside Europe) can compare to Sweden in terms of international influence, power and importance. I mean, countries with not a very high level of these characteristics but with a relatively big amount of them considering its size and population.

I was thinking about the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, Greece, and possibly Portugal Romania and Finland.

The Netherlands, because it is the most important country of the ""Benelux"" and for its size, it has a relatively large importance. It has even been described as the ""Most important nation of all the small nations"".

Poland because it has the second biggest economy of the countries in the ""Slavonic"" world (after Russia) and it is one of the most developed ones.

Norway because, despite its relatively small population, it has valuable resources (such as petroleum) and it is one of the richest and well developed countries in the world.

Greece because it has traditionally been the most well developed country in the zone of the Balkans (although sometimes Greece is excluded when we talk about this region) if not the most developed, despite its profound economic crisis. Until recently, it had the biggest economy in the zone, but it was surpassed by Romania, if we include Romania (or at least parts of the Romanian territory) to be in the Balkans. Also, ancient Greek culture had an enormous impact and influence in the western civilization.

About Portugal, Finland and Romania I am not sure (for example, Romania has a relatively high GDP for its local region, but it is still not as well developed as other countries with those levels of GDP).

pimiyl,"ECOWAS, Mali, Guinea and The Gambia.",60,0.95,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/pimiyl/ecowas_mali_guinea_and_the_gambia/,6,"Hello, I have a quick question regarding the current situation in West Africa. As we know, the current coup in Guinea by Col. Mamady Doumbouya has ousted president Alpha Conde from power. Earlier this year, a coup in Mali ousted a transitional civilian president set up by the negotiation teams after the 2020 coup. Both coups were condemned by ECOWAS members as illegal transitions of power and requested immediate return to the previous arrangement under the threats of sanctions.

So my question is - are there grounds for, if it is at all possible, a repeat of an united intervention as seen in The Gambia in 2017 that replaced the longtime president Yahya Jammeh with a new administration. In my opinion, such an intervention would produce instability of such magnitude (especially in Mali) that neither country could effectively recover. The first thing that is apparent is that both Guinea and Mali are much larger than The Gambia, and would require significantly more resources and manpower to manage. Secondly, Mali already has an insurgent problem in Northern Mali that is , through all the coup problems, still being worked on by France after the first suspension of cooperation. 

So, do you think that these interventions would out of ECOWAS' depth? Was The Gambia's problem manageable due to it's sheer small size? What would an unpunished coup precedent mean for ECOWAS?",1630879962.0
phc4bm,The Lions legacy,165,0.91,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/phc4bm/the_lions_legacy/,29,"Recently intense fighting has been reported in and around Bazarak ([Panjshir resistance statement](https://twitter.com/TOLOnews/status/1433832297011326983)). Bazarak is the birthplace of Ahmad Shah Massoud, Afghan folk hero, who held Panjshir Valley against the Soviets for almost ten years. Later he led the fight against the Taliban and was nicknamed The Lion of Panjshir, but was ultimately assassinated in 2001. Panjshir is the only province in Afghanistan where the Taliban face meaningful resistance. Rumors say that Panjshir militias have refused unconditional surrender but have offered to lay down arms under certain conditions, which the Taliban did not accept.

*Update Sep 5:* Some hours after this post the Taliban announced complete capture of Panjshir but had to rescind later on. Outlets of both sides claim they came out ahead. The situation remains in flux.

With Panjshir seemingly about to fall *\[edit, Sep 5: in the near future\]* the grace period seems to be coming to an end and the Taliban will have established control. On September 1st Reuters reported that ""Pakistan planned to send security and intelligence officials, \[...\], to Kabul [to help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-frets-over-security-threats-neighbouring-afghanistan-2021-09-01/)."" With Pakistani support for the Taliban being an open secret for a while it comes as no surprise that Pakistan would be the first to move. Pakistan is also worried about ISIS-K gaining more prominence and wants to stabilize the situation at its border where on August 29 [two Pakistani soldiers were killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/militant-fire-across-afghan-border-kills-two-pakistan-soldiers-says-army-2021-08-29/).

*Update Sep 5:* On September 4th Faiz Hameed, head of the Pakistani ISI [has arrived in Kabul](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/pakistan-intelligence-chief-lt-gen-faiz-hameed-reaches-kabul-as-taliban-set-to-announce-government/articleshow/85922187.cms), being the first senior official to do so since the return of the Taliban to power.

If this comes to pass Pakistan will make large inroads in Afghanistan, possibly raising concerns for India, but opening up Afghanistan to more international engagement. I do not think India could project meaningful support into Panjshir nor do I know if there is the political will for such a move. But could we possibly see India becoming more active at its border with Pakistan, while Pakistani focus is split or are there any other options for India to limit Pakistani influence or at least make it a costly move for Pakistan? Are there any other nations who might be concerned with Pakistan growing its influence?

With presumed Pakistani support, possibly drone or air strikes, it does not seem like any faction could render resistance against Taliban rule. With the fight against ISIS-K the Taliban can possibly create the image of being a lesser evil and translate this into favorable media coverage. Considering this do you think Pakistan is about to recognize the Taliban government and who is likely to follow suit?

*Update Sep 5:* Consensus from the comment section seems to be that 1) Panjshir is in an increasingly precarious position and is not about to receive support. 2) No external actor is willing or able to challenge Taliban control and 3) desire for stability in Afghanistan could lead to support for the Taliban by external actors",1630697471.0

This is stated in the bank's development strategy for 2022-26.  

The bank intends to increase the volume of projects in the participating countries by 2.7 times, bringing it to $ 10.9 billion. At the same time, the total amount of investments in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan will reach $ 500 million, or four times more than in 2020. At the end of 2020, the decline in the GDP growth rate of the Bank's member countries is estimated at 2.9%, the budget deficit at 1-6% of GDP.

In Armenia, financing is planned to be carried out mainly in euros and dollars, but the bank is ready to issue loans in national currency. To this end, the EDB will accumulate reserves in national currencies, wishing to bring their volume to 35% of its total liabilities by 2026.

Macroeconomic forecast allows counting on strengthening the influence of positive factors in the Armenian economy.

It should be noted that since 2009 Armenia has been a full member of the Eurasian Development Bank. The republic's contribution to the Bank's capital is 100 thousand US dollars.

The EDB intends to become the main participant in the financing of three large investment projects. About $ 1.2 billion will be allocated for this. One of these projects is related to the expansion of the road and rail corridor ""Europe ― Western China"", which will reduce the transit time of goods for Armenia as well. Another project is a unified infrastructure for the transfer of goods to the countries of the Eurasian Bank, the third is an increase in hydropower capacities.

Along with this, on August 24, information was received about the increase by the International Monetary Fund of the reserves of the participating countries, including Armenia, as an aid to the restoration of the world economy after the coronavirus. The new reserves are planned to be used to obtain convertible currency at an extremely low interest rate.",1630589786.0

pfc381,The Coming Collapse of China - 10 years later,853,0.93,geopolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/pfc381/the_coming_collapse_of_china_10_years_later/,219,"Stumbled onto [this old FP article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/12/29/the-coming-collapse-of-china-2012-edition/) by Gordon Chang and it's actually really interesting just how similar these 10 year old arguments are to the same ones being made today. 

> China outperformed other countries because it was in a three-decade upward supercycle, principally for three reasons. First, there were Deng Xiaoping’s transformational “reform and opening up” policies, first implemented in the late 1970s. Second, Deng’s era of change coincided with the end of the Cold War, which brought about the elimination of political barriers to international commerce. Third, all of this took place while China was benefiting from its “demographic dividend,” an extraordinary bulge in the workforce.

The three points are still frequently repeated when it comes to talking about the inevitable collapse of the Chinese economy.

> Hu Jintao, the current leader, is presiding over an era marked by, on balance, the reversal of reform. There has been, especially since 2008, a partial renationalization of the economy and a marked narrowing of opportunities for foreign business. For example, Beijing blocked acquisitions by foreigners, erected new barriers like the “indigenous innovation” rules, and harassed market-leading companies like Google. Strengthening “national champion” state enterprises at the expense of others, Hu has abandoned the economic paradigm that made his country successful.

Replace Hu Jintao with Xi Jinping, and 2008 with 2012, and this sentence could've been written this year - almost word for word. In the last couple of years, Hu has been ""rehabilitated"" in the eyes of the west, now seen as a reformer and liberal in comparison to Xi. I imagine that if/when the next paramount leader takes the helm in China, Xi would also undergo a similar rehabilitation. 

> China is more dependent on international commerce than almost any other nation, so trade friction — or even declining global demand — will hurt it more than others. The country, for instance, could be the biggest victim of the eurozone crisis.

This described the entire Trump logic behind starting the trade war, and it's the eurozone crisis that gave China a port in the Eastern Mediterranean at Piraeus. 

The irony is that China has grown significantly [less dependent on exports as a percentage of GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS?locations=CN) - going from the high of 36% in 2006 to just 18.5% in 2020. Among other sizable economies of the world, this is only slightly higher than Japan (17.6), India (18.1), and the United States (11.7). 

In contrast, Germany stands at a whopping 43.8, France at 28.0, and UK at 27.4. 

> The Chinese workforce will level off in about 2013, perhaps 2014, according to both Chinese and foreign demographers, but the effect is already being felt as wages rise, a trend that will eventually make the country’s factories uncompetitive. China, strangely enough, is running out of people to move to cities, work in factories, and power its economy.

This prediction has yet to pass 10 years later. 

> At the same time that China’s economy no longer benefits from these three favorable conditions, it must recover from the dislocations — asset bubbles and inflation — caused by Beijing’s excessive pump priming in 2008 and 2009

This is more or less the same argument that is being used nowadays to predict an imminent Chinese banking collapse. 

> At a time when crucial challenges mount, the Communist Party is beginning a multi-year political transition and therefore ill-prepared for the problems it faces. There are already visible splits among Party elites, and the leadership’s sluggish response in recent months — in marked contrast to its lightning-fast reaction in 2008 to economic troubles abroad — indicates that the decision-making process in Beijing is deteriorating.

Societal controls have arguably become stronger in the last 10 years, not weaker, as Chang predicted. Xi's ruthless purge of dissenting elements within the party, and the [destruction of the CIA informal networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html) within China has dramatically increased overall state stability, at least on the surface. 

It's always interesting to look at these predictions with the benefit of hindsight. What really stands out is just how *wrong* the predictions were. Granted, some of the other rosy predictions didn't come to pass - e.g. the IMF predicted China's economy would surpass the US' in size by 2016 and that has not happened. But it is still concerning that the same arguments are being used today as they were 10 years ago, when economic reality in the last 10 years has more-or-less proved otherwise.",1630435471.0

As I understand it, in the absence of the US presence, China and maybe Russia will ramp up their geopolitical objectives in the region.  To a layman like myself, seems like the Taliban will have firm control, and will be cooperative to China and Russia.

If I understand the above correctly, what does this mean for the US?  Does the US government plan to recognize Taliban sovereignty, or will they try to form a sort of Western Bloc against that region?  I highly doubt that they will attempt to antagonize the Taliban anytime soon, or even execute a sort of proxy war.  In addition, as I understand it, ISIS and the Taliban are not friendly to each other.  In a crazy way, it almost seems like the Taliban and the West share a common enemy (again) with ISIS.

Minsk (in a move similar to Turkey's last year action) is flying migrants from Middle East to Belarus, and forcing them, using military forces, towards UE's borders. This move, straight from hybrid warfare's playbook, is already causing some political and social destabilisation in Polish media dispute, causing unreasonable actions of politicans from both sides. 

The border crisis is fueled on the eve of Zapad '21, massive military manouvers in Belarus and Russia's western districts. Yesterday, news emerged about Russia mobilizing 50k reservists this month, scale unseen since the fall of USRR.

If there is a will in Moscow to test credibility of NATO in a limited capacity, for example by ""accidential"" crossing of border by some training units, through the Suwalki Gap, the timing to do this might be better then ever. USA credibility has taken a hit in Afghanistan, Poland is not received well in the West due to undemocratic actions of its government.
