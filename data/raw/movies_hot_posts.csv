It took a final destination series of coincidences and a super smart zombie to beat this, almost like a reversal of the trope where the heroes needed luck to survive.

The one that always fails is to entrench in a bunker or fortified building like a police station, eg resident evil 2. Imho, the fortifications give a false sense of security so the humans there start to make more noise and attract more zombies. 

Also i just saw abraham lincoln vs zombies, and its the first movie that had my pet strategy of fake doors. Zombies always target doors and windows, so if you nail a door to a wall, the zombies will pound on it instead of the real door.",1644522836.0

When I mean happy ending, I do not mean the *movie* having a happy ending. I mean *Godzilla specifically* does not reach the end of the film in a state of contentment or happiness except for one time. It’s quite sad.

Godzilla ends all of his films in four or five states of being. He can die at the end of a movie. Battered, he can swim off into the sea after a hard fight with visible resignation at his role in the universe. He can fall into water and disappear. He can revel in claiming his territory or in conquering something. He can come back from apparent death and scream his rage at the camera in a mock cliff-hanger. Or the movie can just end with him merely *existing* with no change having occurred in his life.

Sure, he can be polite and shake Jet Jaguar’s hand, but is he *happy*? He showed up and got into a fist fight and leaves. That’s his only value to this world and to the people that want nothing to do with him otherwise and destroy his home. 

The one exception is the ending of Destroy All Monsters (1968). The movie ends with him and his son in a state of amiable existence on his island. Even then the prospect of being a single Dad is a lonely and stressful one. The other 2 baby movies end with his body shutting down in an ice storm and being instinctively driven to look after a cuck baby respectively.

I’ve had enough. It’s been 68 years. Let the poor Dinosaur be truly happy *just once*.",1644496030.0

spdzb5,My favorite found footage horror movies,10,0.64,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/spdzb5/my_favorite_found_footage_horror_movies/,35,"I'm a huge fan of found footage horror. Here's a list of my favorites (along with ones I didn't enjoy so much). I tried to be as spoiler free as possible.

# Ones I enjoyed

**Afflicted** \- Travel blogger has a health condition where he could die at any moment. Wants to take one last amazing trip around the world.

**As Above So Below** \- Archaeologist wants to document the catacombs beneath Paris. Not for the claustrophobic.

**Bad Ben** \- Paranormal Activity if the homeowner was a curmudgeon. I want to be clear. This is a terrible movie, but it's a fun bad movie. I read it was made with a budget of $300, which is impressive.

**Blair Witch** \- A solid sequel to the original.

**The Blair Witch Project** \- One of the OG found footage horror films. Still holds up pretty well.

**The Borderlands/Final Prayer** \- The Vatican sends a priest to investigate a miracle. Had some genuinely jaw dropping moments.

**Butterfly Kisses** \- Filmmaker finds a documentary about an urban legend. He goes down a dangerously obsessive rabbit hole.

**Chronicle** \- Some of the effects don't hold up especially well, but I loved the concept. All around a solid movie.

**Cloverfield** \- One of my favorites. Way ahead of its time with all of the Easter eggs hidden around the internet.

**The Conspiracy** \- Felt very relevant given the amount of conspiracy theorists out there now. Huge moments of tension.

**Creep and Creep 2** \- A man played by Mark Duplass hires someone to document his life. Duplass is amazing in both films.

**Death of a Vlogger** \- Scottish film about a vlogger accused of faking paranormal incidents. Plays well with your expectations.

**Delivery: The Beast Within** \- Starts off like a TLC show about a couple trying to get pregnant. Gets very VERY dark.

**Found Footage 3D** \- A documentary about filmmakers making a found footage horror movie. I don't have 3D glasses so I just watched the 2D version, but it didn't take away from it at all.

**Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum** \- A Korean adaptation of Grave Encounters. Takes the original premise and makes it its own thing.

**Grave Encounters** \- A movie that posits what if the cheesy paranormal reality shows had something real happen. The first act is genuinely hilarious and there are some pretty great scares in the rest of the film. The sequel is ok.

**Hell House LLC** \- A group of friends open a haunted house in a supposedly haunted hotel. I just love the concept so much and I found it to be very entertaining. The sequels are just ok.

**Host** \- Takes place during the pandemic and the entire vantage point is from a Zoom call.

**Incident at Loch Ness** \- A documentary about a documentary that Wernor Herzog is making about the Loch Ness monster. Very funny. Found footage horror meets The Office.

**Lake Mungo** \- A chilling tale of a family mourning the death of their daughter. Very unique take on the genre.

**The Last Exorcism** \- A religious con artist performs fake exorcisms. He invites a documentary crew to film his last one.

**Paranormal Activity Series** \- These are one of my guilty pleasures. I like them all, even the not-so-good ones. 3 is my favorite.

**REC and REC****^(2)** \- Spanish documentarian follows a crew of firefighters. They investigate an incident at an apartment complex.

**Savageland** \- Told primarily through a series of disturbing photographs. Loved this take on the genre.

**Trollhunter** \- Really impressive from a production standpoint. Right up there with Cloverfield.

**The Tunnel** \- Australian movie about the tunnels under Sydney. Really enjoyed this one.

**Unfriended and Unfriended: Dark Web** \- The entire movies take place on a computer screen. It's so fun keeping track of everything that's going on on the screens.

**V/H/S and V/H/S 2** \- The idea of anthology horror where each short film is directed by a different person is so cool to me. I've heard V/H/S Viral is terrible. I saw V/H/S '94 and thought it was ok.

**The Visit** \- Kids visit their grandparents. A solid entry from M. Night Shyamalan.

**Willow Creek** \- A couple travels to Willow Creek, California to make a documentary about Bigfoot. I won't say which one, but there was one scene that left me saying, ""Damn, that was impressive.""

&#x200B;

# Ones I didn't like

**Apollo 18** \- The declassified footage of a secret moon mission. Just kind of bland all around.

**The Bay** \- A mysterious illness plagues a small town. I was excited because it seemed like appropriate viewing with the pandemic, but it was pretty average.

**Crowsnest** \- One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, boring, and aggressively stupid characters.

**Dabbe: The Possession/Dabbe: Curse of the Jinn** \- It was interesting to see a Turkish horror film. I was very intrigued by the culture and mythology. But at a 2h 25m run time, it's way too long. Could've told the same story in 90 minutes.

**The Devil's Doorway** \- Priests from the Vatican are sent to investigate a miracle. It's in the 1960s, which is an interesting concept, but they played a little fast and loose with the capabilities of the recording equipment in a way that took me out of it.

**Followed** \- YouTuber livestreams a visit to a haunted hotel. This one was just ok for me.

**The Houses October Built** \- Group of friends tries to find the scariest haunted attraction. So frustrating watching the characters make bad decision after bad decision.

**The Medium** \- Gorgeous cinematography. Feels like you're watching a real documentary for the first 10 minutes of the film. I was also excited because this one came out just last year. Unfortunately it's way too long and the characters make very questionable decisions that left me frustrated.

**M.O.M. (Mothers of Monsters)** \- Has one of the most hateable characters I've ever seen in a movie and not in a fun way.

**Noroi: The Curse** \- I was looking forward to this one because it's kind of revered in the genre. But it was way too long and not very scary.

**The Pyramid** \- Just really terrible. Also would shift from found footage to regular movie whenever it was convenient.

**The Sacrament** \- About a commune in Africa. Major inconsistencies with how the footage was captured really took me out of it.

**The Taking of Deborah Logan** \- Some good creepy vibes, but it's very inconsistent with its rules (e.g., there are very convenient jump cuts for scares along with suspenseful music).

&#x200B;

splrbp,Directors Who Are Their Own Worst Enemies?,4,0.63,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/splrbp/directors_who_are_their_own_worst_enemies/,54,"So I recently rewatched The Sixth Sense and while l think this movie remains a masterpiece a thought occurred to me afterward:

I think that M. Knight Shyamalan's problem is that more than 20 years later he's still chasing the ghost of this film.  At a certain point the world labeled him  ""twist ending guy.""  And  instead of bucking that label he's mostly leaned into it.

With only two exceptions, After Earth and Last Airbender which basically were ""work for hire""  jobs,  every project he's done since has been a variation on the same theme.  They're all horror/suspense thrillers with a big final act reveal.  Sometimes the twist ""lands"" but it seems like - more often that not lately - it doesn't.

Case in point: Old(2021).  That movie actually had a great premise and started out strong.  But the final reveal comes with a massive info dump that raises so many questions about what you've just seen that the film literally collapses under the weight of its own bullshit.

I find myself wishing he'd just do something completely different like an action film, historical drama, a comedy, or even just another suspense movie albeit one that doesn't rely on a twist.  But it's like he just can't get out of his own way.

This got me thinking.  What other directors are their own worst enemies or, at the very least, have bad habits that self-sabotage their work?",1644540799.0

My personal choice would be the movie ""The King's Speech"" and the character would be King George VI. I know this might seem like an odd choice because who can really relate to royalty. For the people who haven't heard of the movie. The plot is right here - 

 England's Prince Albert (Colin Firth) must ascend the throne as King George VI, but he has a speech impediment. Knowing that the country needs her husband to be able to communicate effectively, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) hires Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian actor and speech therapist, to help him overcome his stammer. An extraordinary friendship develops between the two men, as Logue uses unconventional means to teach the monarch how to speak with confidence.  

The reason I connect with the character so much is because we both have a stutter/stammer. This may seem like such a basic thing, but it meant so much to me. I don't ever cry during a movie but it made me do it. Just the first few minutes of the film made me. Seeing him work through all of his struggles meant so much.

spiftj,Unearthing an Obscure Classic - The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires,5,0.62,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/spiftj/unearthing_an_obscure_classic_the_legend_of_the/,5,"Last night I was graced with the opportunity to watch one of the most fascinating and fun movies I have ever encountered. It was picked by a member of our Film Club, and it was a part of the Shaw Bros Studios category.
 
If you’re familiar at all with the films of said studio, you will know they are most famous for their immense output of kung fu films (it is often argued that their film The Chinese Boxer (1970) is the first real kung fu movie). However, the eponymous studio also made romance films, comedies, and even explored the sci-fi and horror genres. It was from this smaller subsect of cinematic peculiarities that my Club member found a crimson-soaked jewel called The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires (1974).
 
Here is a small run down of the plot. A Chinese monk traveling through Transylvania circa 1800 pilgrimages to Dracula’s castle to request his help restoring the power of seven golden vampires that he serves back home in China. Dracula, who is imprisoned, takes over the monk’s body and, now free to leave the castle, heads for China. (Fun Fact: Dracula here is played by John Forbes-Robertson, who is the only actor besides Christopher Lee to ever play Dracula in a Hammer Horror.)
 
Fast forward one hundred years and Dr. Van Helsing, alongside his son, Leyland, are visiting a Chinese university, where the infamous vampire hunter is giving lectures on vampire mythology in the East. Most of the lecture attendees write him off, except for the ambiguous Hsi Tien-an (played fabulously by David Chiang, a standard Shaw Bros protagonist). Hsi divulges to the doctor that his ancestral home deep in rural China is plagued by the seven golden vampires of lore, and he requests his help defeating them.
 
Together, the Van Helsings, Hsi, Hsi’s family of martial arts experts, and a wealthy European princess yearning for adventure, set off through the bandit-ridden and vampire-haunted countryside to wage war against the golden blight.
 
Now, if you’re at all like me, then this plot comes across absurd and disastrous. And yet, the film is brilliant. And once you start thinking about it, it becomes clear why.
 
To start, this is the Shaw Bros Studio, so The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires is going to accomplish the bare minimum any Shaw production does: namely, there will be beautiful sets, immersive scenery, and of course, eye-popping martial arts. The real twist of this kung fu production, however, is the addition of the Hammer Films production studio.
 
“Hammer Horror,” as they’re called, are a collection horror films produced by the British studio. They were exceptionally popular in the 1950s and 60s, when many of the gothic novels of the 19th century were first entering the public domain, which allowed for copyright-free adaptations. By the 1970s, this style of horror was waning in popularity, largely due to the ever-growing onset of more inventive – and much scarier – horror, including an influx of stylish European films, which began to deviate from traditional gothic tones (in part normalized by Hammer studio) in favor of more modern or irreverent ones.
 
Meanwhile, on the other end of the globe, Hong Kong was experiencing a cinematic boom thanks to the efforts of the Shaw collective. The successes of their late 60s wuxia and early 70s kung fu films had established them as an international production powerhouse. By mid 70s they were branching out, and producing sometimes a dozen movies a month. Their mostly loyal cadre of directors, actors, writers, and crewmen were experiencing a collective creative renaissance; circa 1974, the studio was poised to make whatever type of movie they wanted. And they did.
 
It was Don Houghton who first contacted the Shaw Bros about his idea for the film. Houghton was a screenwriter at the time for Hammer Films. His previous works had been mostly Dracula-inspired screenplays, or episodes of popular British TV series, including Dr Who. It was through his father-in-law that he was able to arrange to meet with Run Run Shaw, and a deal was struck to produce the film. Roy Ward Baker, a British director who was well-known for his horror chops, was positioned to direct, and Houghton finalized the script and gave the film its title. Peter Cushing, a stage-turned-film actor, was another Hammer Films staple. He was cast as Dr. Van Helsing, alongside Robin Stewart playing his son. (Fun Fact: the original 1897 incarnation of Val Helsing does have a son, but he is deceased.) Julie Ege, a Norwegian actress whose ascension to the film world was spawned by a one-time Penthouse magazine profile, was cast as Vanessa Buren, the wealthy thrill-seeker who finances the vampire hunt. As previously mentioned, David Chiang plays Hsi, the capable eldest sibling of the afflicted village’s family, and he is supported by a cast of reliable martial artist-actors from the studio, notably Shih Szu, an actor whose status as a female martial arts expert was already established and continued to grow throughout the 70s.
 
The production of The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires sounds like a hectic and culture-shocking affair. The British talent was brought to Hong Kong to film either on location in the Kowloon mountains or on the vast sets of Movietown. Baker, who was admittedly attempting the Herculean task of directing a kung fu horror movie, had numerous issues and run-ins with the Shaw crews, who were populated by Indians, Koreans, and Japanese, as well as Chinese. On top of that, stylistic differences came to head between the Hammer-ites and the Shaw-ites on set, which ultimately led to esteemed “million dollar” director Chang Cheh stepping in to direct the kung fu sequences of the film, which, at a casual guess, occupies roughly half the film’s humble 90-minute runtime. (Another Fun Fact: the Chinese edition of the movie is considerably longer, since it includes much more kung fu than the Western release.)
 
Seemingly against all odds, The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires completed production and was released in 1974 to Chinese and British audiences before getting a slightly more expanded release in Europe and the United States. It should come as no surprise what happened next.
 
The film bombed. Box office revenue figures are not even available (at least insofar as I looked). Critics panned the film, and even Baker would go on to say he thought the entire production was “a failure.” Apparently the ambitious genre-studio mash-up was too much for the already expanding minds of 1970s audiences, especially American audiences.
 
But time ages everything differently, doesn’t it?
 
The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires is not, by any measure possible, a failure.
 
The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires is a once-in-a-lifetime motion picture.
 
It is a gothic horror film and a kung fu film. It is unique, and charming, and funny, and scary, and action-packed. At times it is romantic, or disgusting, or silly. At turns intense, spiritual, poetic, campy. It is a film totally untethered to the expectations of cinema at-large while simultaneously never sliding into obtuse, experimental, or uncanny territories. The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires is, in short, a miracle of a movie. All one needs to prepare themselves for this unforgettable viewing experience is an open mind and an itch for wonder. You will not know what’s coming, and that’s for the better.",1644531028.0

I can forgive most of what the creators were doing with regard to setting up the ""Dark Universe"", but the biggest letdown of this movie was the fact that it barely had anything to do with actual mummies. It could have been called ""The Sorceress"", then change every instance of mummy with sorceress in the script, and it would've been exactly the same. Better, even! Because at least then I'm not left feeling letdown by the lack of pyramids, ancient tombs, deadly traps, and basically anything remotely related to mummy and Egyptian mythology. I mean, why make a movie about mummies and never take the plot to Egypt even once during the entire runtime?

sp3v45,I watched Krull (1983). Discuss!!,20,0.6,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sp3v45/i_watched_krull_1983_discuss/,57,"Growing up in the 80s, I had HBO, Cinemax, Showtime etc… so there were plenty of films I could watch repeatedly. One of those films was Krull. Even as an 8 year-old, I knew it was no Star Wars, but it was awesome. Some scenes stuck with me over the years: the oatmeal quicksand, the cyclops getting crushed in the mountain, …even a scene of one guy doing a somersault in the mountain hallway for no apparent reason; my child-mind could tell it was one of the worst stunt performances ever lol

Anyway, I grew up and mostly forgot Krull. But then seeing the ‘glaive’ in Ready Player One really got me thinking about Krull again. Should I revisit a nice childhood memory? I have rewatched some of my childhood classics over the years, mostly animated tv shows, and have been severely disappointed that for the most part, my memories are far superior to the actual product. 

Well, I found Krull at a nice low price on Blu-ray with a cool retro video cassette packaging design and figured, what the heck, let’s watch!

Here is a list of thoughts I had while watching:

First thing I noticed is that James Horner’s score seems to borrow some melodic touches from his ‘Wrath of Khan’ soundtrack. 

Throughout the film, the sets are not bad. The castle at the beginning and the Beast’s organic mountain sets are pretty nice and fairly grand in scale, helped with some matte paintings. 

The movie is an odd mix of sci-fi and fantasy. There are some beautiful mountain locations, possibly enhanced with some matte paintings. 

Colwyn, the lead played by Ken Marshall, to whom Chris Pratt bears an uncanny resemblance,  is a bit of a whimpering mess at first. And his oddly striped vinyl pants are very out of place. 

Wow, the gang of heroes really face very little challenge along the way. Zero challenge for Colwyn to get the glaive. Zero challenge to meet the seer. Zero challenge to get the firemounts, which were conveniently nearby. Various deaths have little to no consequence for the outcome of the story. The script really seems to be a series of set pieces laid out in sequence. 

The ending is a really bad bluescreen/rear projection fight. Very anti-climactic. Just the fire of love prevailing. Retch. 

A few cool points though:

The slayer and changeling deaths are pretty cool and creepy. 

The transparent spider was really well done. Stop motion I assume. 

Seeing young Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane was cool! Easy to see why their careers went off the way they did later. 

The final narration of: “…Son shall rule the galaxy” is just the writers begging for a sequel. 

Conclusion: the film is pretty weak overall but has tons of cheesy camp factor which push it into cult classic/guilty pleasure territory. I’m glad I rewatched. It wasn’t a complete disappointment.",1644490158.0

They want to hit the beats of *setup, music stops, punchline* so badly that they'll ruin a joke to do it.  I don't know what made this the standard and maybe it works for a lot of people, but so many trailers (especially trailers for comedies) absolutely ruin jokes by cutting out all the context, ruining the timing, and cutting straight to the most outrageous moment (sometimes even using a more over-the-top line reading than the one they end up using in the movie).  It seems to make a lot of moments and movies as a whole look painfully unfunny, but when they actually come along, you go ""Oh, that was actually pretty good in the right context.""  Although it's a more expositional than comedic, look at the trailer for [The Lost City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3C5KMb3Ch0) and skip 40 seconds for some egregious editing.

The best recent examples I can think of both come from superhero TV shows, but they still work.  The [trailers for Peacemaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OODneEUWUQY) made it look very much like it was straining for an easy laugh, specifically that loud ""There's no superhero called Peacemaker"" moment at the very beginning, but it flowed much better without being edited and as a part of [a longer conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOVVXIm7u88) (1:50 for the exact moment).  Additionally, I remember there being a trailer for Hawkeye that had a [weird moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYb3B1ETlk) where Kate said ""You don't have to say 'definitely' like that"" in an awkward comedy beat, but the actual show used a completely different line reading and made it sound much more [natural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqCL_XOOM1U) (30 seconds).  These maybe aren't the most egregious examples, but I've come to just not trust trailers as good measures of comedy.  Is this because they haven't finished editing the movie at the time, because they want to present it in a certain way, or some other reason?",1644531782.0

You'd never find big budget movies nowadays that would be as violent etc. They remade Total Recall with Colin Farrell but it was really lame and they cut down all of the violence etc. They did the same thing with the Robocop remake.

I've always thought the reason for this was because movie studios knew if they toned the violence down in movies then more people(children, teenagers) could see it and they would make more money.

I liked the cinematography, this is a gorgeous film with a fascinating score that keeps you interested. The performances were great especially Benedict Cumberbatch, I enjoyed his role in the film. The first act of the film doesn't do anything for me, I was watching it and nothing was happening. I was 30 minutes into the film and I still didn't know what the film was about. I don't even know when the second act of the film starts, but I still didn't know what the hell was going on, I was lost and not interested, but I was paying attention the whole time. The cinematography and set design also a little of costume design kept me interested. The weird scenes with Benedict Cumberbatch in the pond, I didn't understand what was going on with that and it was a little disturbing. The best part about this film though is the third act towards the end. I liked the last 35 minutes of the film because the film started to show more depth to it, and Benedict Cumberbatch started to show how good of an actor he really is. The film starts to pick up, in the last 30 minutes, I just don't know why it took so long. I was waiting for something big to happen and nothing happens, but the ending is good.

sotez4,Montgomery Clift: why is he forgotten?,33,0.76,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sotez4/montgomery_clift_why_is_he_forgotten/,17,"During his lifetime Montgomery Clift was considered the equal of his method acting contemporaries Marlon Brando and James Dean and yet both have completely eclipsed him in terms of fame. They are still well known and iconic today whereas Clift is mostly forgotten by the general public. It's ironic because Clift was actually the first of the method actors to make his film debut (before Brando and Dean) and he blew audiences away with his performance in The Search.
It was a performance that felt real and believable and it was like nothing audiences had seen before. People actually thought Clift was a real soldier and they would go up to the director afterwards asking where he found a soldier who could act so good. Clift was one of only 6 actors in film history to receive a Best Actor academy award nomination for his screen debut.

He would continue to give excellent performances in A Place in the Sun and From Here to Eternity and in the 1950's was considered among the greatest film actors of his generation. Sadly Clift had personal problems and after surviving a terrible car accident those problems only got worse. He would continue to act, but by the 1960's his career wasn't going well and he died prematurely at 45 suffering a heart attack most likely brought on by years of drug and alcohol abuse. 

It's sad that he died prematurely because I feel had he lived he would have had a comeback similar to the one Marlon Brando had in the 1970's. Brando had a string of failures in the 1960's and had to audition and get studio approval to appear in The Godfather. His salary for it was only $250,000 a far cry from the one million he received ten years earlier when he did Mutiny on the Bounty. After The Godfather Brando was so popular and iconic that he would be paid millions just for small supporting roles in films.

I bring this up with Brando because I feel had Clift lived he would have thrived in the 1970's, too and been just as popular and iconic as Brando. Most of the directors that were becoming popular in the 1970's were also huge fans of Clift. 
Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese have cited Clift as one of their favorite actors and if the character was written to be older I think he would have made a great Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. I have little doubt Clift would have taken on controversial roles and not played it safe with his acting roles and since he hated the censorship of the studio era (which ended only 2 years after his death) he would have likely felt more free and liberated with his acting roles. So much for what might have been.",1644455574.0

Okay so firstly, I remembered watching this movie when I was a kid, years ago, and I remember enjoying it. The only thing I could remember was Eddie Murphey played an obese woman and that was it. That sounds pretty stupid, and I love stupid things so I'd definitely love this movie, right? Wrong! I mean I'm someone that likes really bad, stupid movies, hell I LOVE Paul Blart Mall Cop!

Now I'm not going to get into too much specifics here but let me just tell you, this is one of the worst movies I've watched. Eddie Murphey plays like 4 characters in this movie and they're all stupid and stereotypical. Stereotypical characters work well when done right, but this was just...wrong.

Please don't get me started on the story! The story is both stereotypical and nonsensical at the same time, and not in a good way!

Good, kind hearted guy is married to an evil woman and falls in love with someone else. Oh but the guy was raised by... a chinese cook that torments children? His wife is obese and evil but... she's played by a guy? Is this stuff supposed to be funny? I don't get it, what was going through their heads when making this movie?

What a shit movie.

Overall I'd give it a 2/10. Not as bad as Paul Blart 2.",1644511105.0

You have to have a very strange sense of humor to understand his work and his stuff tends to be uncomfortable. I've only seen two of his films by I enjoyed both of them: Gummo (1997) and Spring Breakers (2012). The crux of his works are watching young people aimlessly going through life wrapped up in consumer culture. His stuff is quite plotless so more structured viewers might be turned off by his stuff. Gummo has 37% with critics on Rotten Tomatoes, but 73% with audiences. 

My favorite thing about Korine's film is his use of music. He throws in these characters listening to pop music from Britney Spears to Madonna with the characters actions having nothing to do with the songs. For Korine's characters music is pointless. It's just something to hear so there doesn't have to be silence. 

I related to his work because as a kid pop culture was just something to avoid boredom and for some noise to be around. The whole feeling was eerie and nihilistic as I got older. 

I get Beavis and Butthead vibes from Korine's work, though Korine I think is more subtle.",1644477754.0

sohcii,3 Soviet adaptations of Treasure Island: how do these films differ?,13,0.72,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sohcii/3_soviet_adaptations_of_treasure_island_how_do/,5,"Having gained wide popularity in Europe almost immediately after its publication in 1883, «Treasure Island» attracted the attention of Russian publishers quite early, quickly entering the traditional circle of children's reading. The first adapted translation from the French edition of 1885 was published in Moscow in 1886, in the printing house of the brothers E. and M. Verner, as an appendix to the magazine «Around the World». The translation by O. A. Grigorieva, published in 1904, was considered the most popular before the revolution. In the USSR, the most accessible was a good translation by N. K. Chukovsky, made in the first half of the 1930s, almost simultaneously with a less accurate translation by M. A. Zenkevich. And even now Chukovsky's translation is the most popular, despite the presence of other translations. Naturally, such a popular children's novel could not escape the attention of Soviet directors, and 3 films (there is also a funny [cartoon](https://youtu.be/QKRG7PF73UA) from 1988, but it's not about it here) based on this novel were shot in the USSR at different times, and they were all different in spirit. All the films were called the same as the novel.

1. The 1937 film directed by Vladimir Vajnshtok, music by Nikita Bogoslovsky. In accordance with the party line, the motive of the national liberation movement was introduced into the film. The positive heroes seek to get treasures not out of simple human greed, but to buy weapons for the Irish freedom fighters, and the rich man Trelawney becomes a pawnbroker, a traitor and just a bad person here, because capitalists cannot be good people (in fairness, image Trelawney is also often denigrated in Western adaptations). The guy Jim was replaced by a girl Jenny, in love with Dr. Livesey, who disguised herself as a boy in the plot, and John Silver has both legs, but one has shrunk and is shorter than the second, and Ben Gunn dies here. Also, here the names of some characters are transmitted incorrectly. The film was restored twice (in 1960 and 1983): edited and re-recorded. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A](https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A)
2. The 1971 film directed by Evgeny Fridman. Music by Alexey Rybnikov. In the role of Silver — Boris Andreev, in the role of Jim — Aare Laanemets. Another film adaptation, this time with the involvement of Baltic actors. An almost perfect film adaptation — for some miserable hour and twenty-two minutes, the novel was transmitted almost verbatim! There are, however, minimal changes: navigator Billy Bones, instead of boozing like hell, led a healthy lifestyle and didn't die of a heart attack, but under the bullets of former comrades, alone defending the «Admiral Benbow» tavern; there is no Black Dog; there is no scene when Ben Gunn trolled pirates, shouting the catchphrases of Captain Flint. In all other respects, the film follows the novel as closely as possible, and the short timing does not interfere with this at all. Probably, the reason for this is the filigree, verified work of the director: not a single extra frame. There are also eight songs in the film and there is a very sinister Blind Pew. For this film, the fishing sailing-diesel schooner «Klim Voroshilov» was rebuilt into the brigantine «Hispaniola». The vessel was later used in the films «Mermaid Shoals» and «The Life and Amazing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe» (1972, directed by Stanislav Govorukhin). The ship is installed on the Yalta embankment as a restaurant, now it is one of the symbols of the resort. Disputes about which version is better — this one or Vorobyov's mini-series, which will be discussed below — break out every now and then on Russian forums of movie lovers. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI](https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI)
3. 3-serial TV movie of 1982 directed by Vladimir Vorobyov. In the role of Silver — Oleg Borisov, in the role of Jim — Fedya Stukov, previously famous for the role of Tom Sawyer in 1981 film. There are 3 versions of the film — 220 minutes, 194 minutes and 183 minutes. The initial version was 4 episodes of 55 minutes each. In the 1980s, the film was censored twice and became a three-part series. Scenes of violence, gambling, images of dead bodies, especially scary moments were removed from it, taking into account the children's audience of the film. After the first edition, the scenes disappeared: a close-up of the face of Blind Pew with a cork instead of an eye (""and now, boy, take me to the captain!""); Dr. Livesey makes bloodletting to Billy Bones, Jim holds a basin into which blood begins to drip, the doctor's conversation with Billy Bones (see in the book); Dr. Livesey talks about the personalities of the pioneer pirates (Squire's estate); squire's comment on the identity of the pirate killed by Redruth and fell off a cliff in the scene of relocation to the fort. After the second edition, the scenes disappeared: Billy Bones tells a scary story, at this time an owl flies through the room and scares the guests; Jim Hawkins' dream, where John Silver appears for the first time; a drunk Billy Bones descends the stairs and expels two guests from the table; Billy Bones sees Flint in the corner and begs Jim for rum; Blind Pugh's pursuit of Jim along the coast, Jim falls, entangled in a net, Blind Pew pulls his hands to him; Billy Bones' death (falls from the stairs, grabbing a fishing net); Jim searches Bones' body for a key, a hamster crawls along Bones' neck; Hands and O'Brien play cards ""on knives"" (Squire's arrival in Bristol); Hands and O'Brien play cards in the cabin of the ship (Squire: ""I was shut down!""); Squire Trelawny in the cabin of the Hispaniola makes a toast to Jim's health; Hunter found a skeleton under a blanket in the fort (""Dr. Livesey's reconnaissance""); Hunter's corpse torn by a bomb after storming the fort; carpenter Abraham Gray gives Jim a gun; the beginning of a card game on the Hispaniola between Israel Hands and O'Brien, when each of them holds a card in his mouth; Jim brings a bottle of brandy to Hands: ""Thank you. Cheers, Captain!""; Silver in the fort sips from a bottle: ""Do you want a drink? I'll take a sip. And then there is still so much trouble ahead""; Silver examines the black mark and asks about who gave the paper for it: ""Who gave his Bible for such blasphemy?""; Silver ask about the cut-up bible of Dick Pastor: ""Maybe it is still suitable for communion?"" — ""The Bible?"" With a torn page?"". The most famous is the last, shortest version of the film, which is why many perceive this film as a musical children's film, although, as you can see, the film was originally quite creepy, with notes of black comedy. In the late 90s, the company ""Крупный план"" released a videotape with a little-affected second version. The original version of the film is currently unavailable. Also, the film has noticeably deviated from the original source: Fedya is too small for the role of Jim, and plays some kind of tomboy pioneer instead and the involvement of a nine-year-old boy in the main role contradicts the main motive of the novel — the formation of a teenager's personality (although Jim's age is not specified in the novel, but his psychology corresponds to a boy aged 12-13 years, or in extreme cases 14-15); Silver turned from a tall, exceptionally strong man into a dry, pale, nondescript old man, similar to a physics teacher from high school (however, there is an alternative opinion that this is a brilliant non-canon: he seems homely, but in fuct he a sinister gray cardinal, taking coolness and intelligence. He boasts that Flint himself was afraid of him, in the voice of a Soviet engineer proud of being awarded a prize… But he manages to grab a pistol faster than others, and crushing the spine of a hefty sailor with a blow of a crutch is easy for him. According to the actor, such an image is an evil satire on domestic elderly experienced ""thieves in law"" who feel like the rulers of fate); Ben Gunn armed himself with a blowpipe with nerve poison and killed Silver, allegedly by accident; Billy Bones, performed by Leonid Markov, is rather an anti-villain, sincerely tired of the bloody pirate freedom and looking for a quiet and peaceful place to live, even his catchphrase about whether to leave witnesses alive (""The dead don't bite""), handed over to Captain Flint; also, the prologue (before arriving in Bristol) is stretched out for the whole 45 minutes due to the hamsters, owls and shells, quotes from other works of Stevenson and theatrically slow dialogues.

I seen this movie's poster popping up on Google 

Someday before it's release 

& I was kinda excited to see if this movie turned out to be good.....


Then after it got released I saw it's IMDb 

rating is only 6.1 & Terrible rotten tomatoes score

I skipped it 

[ Tho around the same time I watched the raid for the first time &

 I was thinking if I should watch it just for ""Iko uwais"" ever since ]


★So, I watched it 2 weeks ago and here's my review:- 

It starts with a fight & u can tell that it's lackluster

After that next 30 minutes it's just exposition & 

mark Wahlberg's being mark Wahlberg

After that Iko got captured at the u.s embassy.... In his own will

& he is carrying a self-destroying disc 

Now like u seen in other movie.... Iko refuses to give password that can encrypt the disc

He made an offer that would get him to a plane safety & he will give the password at the last moment


There was a Iko vs 2 attackers fight but it got butchered by Hollywood camera tricks

★Now.... Good part started 

When mark Wahlberg took Iko & goes for the airport.... 

There was some gunfights that are kinda hard to follow but still interesting

& It goes on for like 10/11 minutes

This part was pretty good actually


At the very end there is a plot twist which is good

But It still felt unsatisfying because a lot of reasons

★Story is overall mediocre.... Even with the twist

★Characters are forgettable & I don't know why john malkovich is in this movie because he didn't do anything memorable in here

★Shaky cam aside it had some good actions

Last 30minutes was pretty thrilling 

* Overall I think this movie isn't hot garbage...there are couple of good actions & scenes that make it at least watchable

MBJ has talked a little about the story of Creed 3, saying it’s a very personal story and it’s something close to his heart. 

My speculation is Creed 3 will take some influence from the fantastic MMA film Warrior (2011) and have Adonis Creed fight is “brother”, Jonathan Majors’ character. 

Majors’ would be playing another illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, but unlike Adonis he wasn’t adopted by Mary Anne and grew up poor.

Majors’ would have a lot of jealousy and perhaps hatred for Adonis, and would be on a similar path Adonis was on in Creed 2.

Even describing the plot is just absolutely insane. Mrs Robinson seduces a college graduate, has an affair with him, restricts him from seeing her daughter, arranges a marriage to stop Ben from seeing her daughter, and in the end gets locked inside a church while her daughter and Ben do whatever they want for the year and a half before they get divorced.

I watched the first half (up to the stripper date) last night and watched the second half today. And they are basically two completely different films. The first half is Ben and Mrs. Robinson’s story, and the second is Elaine and Ben’s story. And another thing I loved is how the characters completely changed within these two halves. Mrs. Robinson reveals her true self by forcing Elaine into a marriage and accusing Ben of being a rapist. Ben shows how awful he can be, by tormenting a girl on her first date and stalking her.

There is no protagonist. If you forced me to pick one, probably Elaine, but that’s because she ends up looking the best. Ben and especially Mrs. Robinson have shown how despicable they are, and it’s great that this movie tries to tackle this for a movie that was made 55 years ago.

Loved the first fifteen minutes due to how fast-paced it was. Loved Ben breaking into the Robinson housefor how fast-paced it was.

However, this movie does have some criticism from me, and that’s mainly due to the soundtrack. They play the same two songs THREE TIMES EACH. And they played the fair song like five minutes apart from each other, that’s just not enough room to breathe.

Overall, 10/10. I can’t wait to watch it again.",1644370348.0

I stumbled upon [the poster](https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/6HUry3KOdiOevjFE61lhi3mzQBf.jpg) to the small-budget animated film ""Gulliver Returns"" which advertises that it is ""From the team behind Moana, Zootopia and Big Hero 6"". This peaked my curiosity as the same site claimed the film is from Ukraine and Cyprus, two countries I don't often associate with Disney pictures.

So I started looking into it. ""The team"" meaning the producers? No. The writers? No. Neither the director or none of the actors had anything to do with the films either. So I started going through the list of the crew, it turns out this is the first project of almost everyone involved and there certainly isn't a team of people who had been the creative forces alongside Disney legends Clements and Musker to create Moana.

Except for one person that is, animation director [Tony Bonilla](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2254101/) who previously had worked as an animator on those films and some other big ones. I'm sure they're great at what they're doing but I can't help but wonder if part reason they were hired wasn't just so that the producer could claim the film to have come from the same ""team"".

so0wc6,Analyzing Allison's Transformation in The Breakfast Club,42,0.74,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so0wc6/analyzing_allisons_transformation_in_the/,24,"First, a little disclaimer. I do not frequent this subreddit, but I wanted to make a post about this and I thought this would be the best place for it (if it isn't, please let me know). This is going to be a long post, with some discussion of (relevant) personal experiences so buckle up. The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies, Allison is my favorite character, and I relate to her a lot so I have a lot of thoughts about this topic. This also might be all over the place, so I apologize in advance for that. 

Now let's get into the actual topic. I've seen debates about [Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club](https://youtu.be/rprB-_jyLjU?t=60), with comments about how her makeover was out of character, made her look worse, and is just another example of a girl changing herself to get a guy. I understand the frustration and where these comments are coming from, but I think that is a very surface-level analysis of this scene and a disservice to Allison's character development in the movie. 

First of all, I think the makeover serves as a physical manifestation of her growth throughout the movie. At the beginning of the movie, she appears dressed in all dark colors, is fully covered, her hair covering her eyes, and her body language is very closed off. Her character is introverted, painfully shy, quiet, a little weird, and it is implied that she has little to no friends. 

But as she gets to know the rest of the group, as she forms relationships with them and starts to be able to show who she truly is, she begins to open up to them. She tells them about her personal struggles, about how she gets no attention at home and is a compulsive liar (which are important to her character but I'm not going to get into that in this post). She also becomes louder and brighter, inserts herself into conversations, and starts to take up space. 

Considering that, the makeover makes so much sense in her journey into learning who she is and how to form healthy relationships. She trades in her black long-sleeved jacket and shirt for a white, collared, short-sleeved blouse, puts makeup on, and lifts her hair out of her eyes with a white headband. She also carries herself with new confidence, she's still hesitant right after the makeover, but if you compare her first scene to her last scene, she no longer closes off herself from others and has more open body language.

Now if you think the makeover makes her look worse, that's a personal opinion but I honestly don't think it's relevant to this discussion. The makeover is about her growth and development, she's trying new things and she's getting more in touch with her feminity. As someone who has had a similar journey as Allison's, growing up I thought using makeup and wearing ""girly"" clothes was too much like ""other girls"". I too would wear baggy and dark clothes, simultaneously trying to distance myself from other girls while also trying to blend in with the wall and take up as little space as I could. As I have become more comfortable with my femininity, I've started wearing more makeup and dresses and skirts, but I also keep parts of my old wardrobe. Just like Allison, I still enjoy parts of my old style (""Hey I like that black shit""), but I also no longer demonize anything related to femininity. Teenagehood is the best time to try new styles and figure out who you are, so Allison's makeover is just an extension of her experimentation and her willingness to try something new and stand out to others. Her style at the beginning of the movie was expertly crafted to make her unnoticeable yet different from other girls, which goes hand in hand with her initial characterization and background, and her makeover is a natural progression of her development and what she learned throughout the movie. 

Finally, the makeover also shows her relationship with the other characters in the movie. I think the dialogue between Claire and Allison in this scene especially shows Allison's growth. Allison asks Claire, ""Why are you being so nice to me?"" and Claire responds with ""Because you're letting me."" Now, this is more of my personal analysis, but this shows how Allison is learning to form relationships with others. This dialogue shows how Allison thought that others (especially the popular kids) wouldn't be nice to her, and that stopped her from forming relationships. But here Allison learns that Claire and the popular kids would show her kindness if she let herself get to know them and bond with them (at least as Claire says). I know this feeling, there's a voice in your head that is telling you that no one would ever want to be friends with you so don't even try it, which I think is probably what Allison experienced as well. 

As for Allison's relationship with Andy, I don't think she ever changed herself for him. As I've said the makeover was to display her character growth, and Andy showed interest in her long before this scene. Additionally, his reaction is not the only important one. Yes, she is obviously most nervous to show him her transformation, but she also puts weight into Claire's and Brian's reactions as well and gets confidence from their positive responses. I see the reactions of the people around her more as support and acceptance of her trying new things and becoming brighter, rather than the reason for her transformation. 

TLDR: Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club is a representation of her character growth throughout the movie, and how she learned to take up space, form close relationships, and that performing femininity isn't a curse. I adore her as a character and I think those who say this scene ruined her characterization are misguided.

Okay, I did deliver on the long post. Overall, I think the makeover is a very misunderstood scene, and Allison as a character is also very misunderstood. I'm sorry if I didn't make any sense, I just wanted to share my opinion about this. Thank you so much for reading this post, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this scene if you've made it this far!",1644370227.0

Alfred Molina's unpredictable junkie vs Thomas Jane's unstable character blended with fireworks created one of the most memorable, tension filled scenes for me.

somtml,MARRY ME - Webcomic to Movie,0,0.47,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/somtml/marry_me_webcomic_to_movie/,0,"
MARRY ME comes out on Valentines day starring who's it,  what's her face, and Sarah Silverman. I was an avid reader of the webcomic back in the 2010's so here is the whole plot/story as I remember if you want to compare the original to the movie;


Superstar Girl [forgot her name so she is now Superstar] is getting ready for her next big performance with the help of her *very*  pregnant sister - father of unborn baby is out of the picture.


Pregnant sister tells Superstar if she is mentally well - during the awards show two years ago Superstar proclaimed she would cure cancer within three to four years. Superstar snaps back saying she still has a few years left, and she is fine.


Meanwhile, a guy named Guy has been dragged along to Supestars concert by his BFF Parker. Parker is in love with Superstar and is hoping Superstar will sign her poster MARRY ME written on with bright red ink. Guy is indifferent. 


The concert starts and Superstar does her best but starts to fumble her words through some of her own songs. Pregnant sister brings up her concerns during the intermission but Superstar brushes it off saying it's nothing.


Out in the crowd, Parker realizes she hasnt gone to the bathroom in three days due to her excitement for Superstar. Shoves the poster into Guys hand, making him promise he would try to get Superstars signature when the time comes and runs off to pee.


Parker finds a spot in the bushes and begins her relief. Midway stream, Parker looks at the jumbotron and sees Guy getting  on stage with Superstar? And theres a priest? WTF! Parker is so distraught she stands up . . . And wets her pants. Whoops.


Guy is in Superstars dressing room, trying to comprehend what just happened while Pregnant Sister is freaking out over Superstar. To Superstars defense, she took the MARRY ME sign quite literal and accepted 'Guys proposal' . And who was that priest? Turns out one of fans is a priest and was at the show, so when Superstar asks if anyone could marry them the priest didnt hesitate to come up on stage. Also she just learns guys name is Guy and is like 'really? That's your name?'


Guy and Superstar hear a commotion outside to see Parker arguing with the bouncer how she is Guys BFF and that was *her sign*. Bouncer says 'you smell like piss.' Guy tells Superstar and bouncer Parker is with him and allow her to come back stage. Not after sticking her tongue out at the bouncer for doing his job.


Superstar gives Parker a pair of her own pants which makes Parkers life. Pregnant sister tells Superstar to get a hold of her lawyers to see if she is actually legally married to Guy before showing Superstar how people are talking about her stunt. People started to believe it was planned - the guys name is Guy for heavens sake! Superstar agrees to get a hold of her lawyers but needed to get away from it all - including her manager (over 100 missed calls within 20 minutes of the fiasco)


Superstar, Pregnant sister, Guy, and Parker all load up into her touring bus and head off to the airport to hop into her private jet to Africa - just in time to avoid her manager . .  .who is her DAD! Dun dun dun. 


Dad tracks his daughter's down to the airport and harasses the bus driver to let him know where his daughter's went. The bus driver lies and says Antarctica or the Artic. Some place cold. Dad takes the bait and heads off on his own private jet.


Time passes and the arrive in Africa - a village Superstar donates a bunch of her money towards. The villagers greet Superstar happily when pregnant sister goes hard core into labour, despite it being a few weeks early. Guy steps in, saying he delivered two babies before and even carries around the news paper article.  Superstar reads how he delivered his older sisters baby, twice. On a ferris wheel each time. 


That was the moment Superstar realizes Guy is a good guy, perhaps what she really needs in life.


Baby comes out and they get no longer pregnant sister to a hospital Superstar built with her money. The newborn boy is named Parker after Parker.


Dad finally tracks his daughter's down to Africa and rampages to the hospital to give Superstar a piece of his mind, and they legalities surrounding the marriage. He is also pissed off his first grandsons name is Parker.


The lawyers assemble and tell Superstar the facts. And the fact is her and Guy . . . .are not legally married! Superstars face drops. Deep down she wishes she did legally married Guy.


The six (Superstar, Guy, no longer pregnant sister, Parker, boy Parker, and Dad) fly back to America where Superstar and Guy start a new relationship together.


END.

I think that over the years Hot Rod has found its crowd for the most part since it's such a niche style of comedy that doesn't necessarily work for everyone, but I don't know that it ever had any real success. Hot Rod was made on a $25m budget, and ended up landing at a little over $14m worldwide box office - so it pretty much completely flopped. I think that if it had been made in the current streaming era and released directly to Netflix with a limited theatrical release, it could have been a huge success.

Jeremy Irons as the CEO simply dominates the screen

Simon Baker portrays his character very well. Especially ""What time is it?"" and ""What the fuck is his name again"" moments

I am truly not an SJW that bitches about content in movies and media in general. I don’t believe it should be taken out of circulation or anything because that wouldn’t solve shit and I don’t believe in doing that period.

I watched this movie a couple years ago so some of the details are a little fuzzy but let’s start going through the list of things I remember off the dome (sorry if they happen out of order):

1. The convenience store:

Asian store owner is speaking broken English and Douglas gives the whole spiel of you should learn English and gets mad when the owner doesn’t do what he wants.

The owner was being kind of a dick, but if he was a white guy none of that would have happened.

2. Construction site:

Mexican gangbangers start harassing him, he brings up speaking English again, and then beats them up.

They were the aggressors in the movie but the whole idea of an older white dude getting attacked by multiple brown people and then beating them up instead sounds like a Fox News wet dream.

3. The Nazi store:

If I remember right he goes to an army surplus store and then the owner takes him to the back and shows him all his Nazi stuff and thinks that Douglas is also a white supremacist like him. Douglas then says how he disagrees with him which is obviously supposed to portray him in a good way. It’s literally I’m not a neo-nazi or in the KKK so I’m totally fine.

I didn’t really like this movie at all. I want to make it clear that I don’t think liking it makes you racist. If you like it that’s great, just be cognizant of all the fucked up ideologies he keeps slipping in with other banal complaints about modern life.",1644496305.0

snvcoq,What is/are your favorite cinematography scene(s)?,18,0.69,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snvcoq/what_isare_your_favorite_cinematography_scenes/,34,"For me it has to be the following moments:

- The [match cut in Lawrence of Arabia](https://youtu.be/0ccB1KTzr9o).

This match cut in the beginning is one of the most impactful cuts i’ve seen in a film. The cut went from a close-up shot of something (T.E. lawrence and the match), to a wide-shot of nothing (the sun and open desert). This creates a composition contrast, but remains interlinked through the absence of a color contrast, because we went from the orange match to the orange desert.

In the first shot we see that T.E. Lawrence has power and control over the heat, because he blows out the match. In the next shot we see that the heat has the power and control, because we see a rising sun over an endless desert. This creates an emotional and physical contrast between T.E. Lawrence and his admiration for the desert.

- The [composition shots in Eyes Wide Shut](https://youtu.be/MIdNBBTBuqM)

These shots are really powerful to me and I can’t get these images out of my head. The shots visualize multiple strong emotions, while maintaining a static image. The camera doesn’t move, the people don’t move and the masks don’t have movement in the facial expressions.

This results in a minimalistic image, which causes the focus to go to the compositions of the characters and the emotions on the masks.


- The [match cut in 2001: A Space Odyssey](https://youtu.be/xkNV_wALoYc)

This match cut is also one of the best I’ve seen in a film. This cut visualizes a jump of 3 million years in just a couple seconds. In the first shot we see a bone that the man-apes used as a weapon to kill eachother. In the next shot we see a nuclear weapon in space that humans could use to kill eachother.

The motion, rotation and location between the bone and nuclear weapon don’t exactly allign during the match cut, causing it to not change smoothly. I interpret this as a visualization to show that evolution within the 3 million years isn’t a smooth process as well.",1644355636.0

Or even scenes, like the shower scene in *Psycho*, the opening scene of *Jaws*, or Darth Vader's famous line in *Empire Strikes Back*?

I don't really think superheroes can count as being iconic in and of themselves, because they were arguably iconic *before* their respective franchises, etc.  But I will concede something like the shot of all the Avengers together in New York at the end of *The Avengers* probably fits the bill, because it's something that was born entirely out of the film and is recognisable and therefore somewhat iconic for most people at this point.

I'm struggling to think of anything.

EDIT - I guess I didn't explain my logic with regards to the MCU/superheroes too well, because people keep arguing with me about them. I'm not saying those things aren't iconic, quite the opposite. But they're a given, in the same *Star Wars* is a given, or Bond is a given, etc. These things are massive existing franchises that became iconic long over 10 years ago, and as such are building upon a huge pre-existing audience or off of previously established ideas within the franchise itself.

Also, this isn't meant to be a slight on the quality or merit of these franchises, just that if we didn't rule them out the whole thread would just be people saying ""The Infinity Gaunlet"" or ""Lightsabres"" or whatever. I hope that clarifies. Sorry I wasn't clearer to begin with.",1644411109.0

In terms of the more inhuman characters of Bioshock, del Toro's work in The Shape of Water or even Pan's Labrynth should be evidence enough that he could bring something like Big Daddy to life on the silver screen. Also anyone who watches Nightmare Alley would have a hard time arguing that Cate Blanchett wouldn't be an amazing Dr Tenenbaum.

Re-watched it last night. 

I think this is an almost great B-Movie, I think the 3D part was gilding the lilly, wholly unnecessary if not distracting, the flick stands alone without it.

The stand-out here is William Fichtner, he just nails it as the Accountant. The rest of the cast is fine, Nic Cage is Nic Cage. Amber Heard doesn't add much (Rosie O'Donnell would of been more interesting), and Charlotte Ross has a hilarious set piece (where is she these days?). The writing overall is excellent, but Fichtner's performance is the stand-out here, makes the movie.

The experience of watching this film and my feelings on it since are really unlike most any other film I’ve seen the more I think about it.

I pretty much saw it cold, going in. I knew Frances Mcdormand was in it ( who I love) but that was about it.

Throughout watching the film, I’d be lying if I said I was enjoying it, yet was still completely engrossed. I think mainly not knowing the premise or anything about the film and filmmaker it left me openly worried about where the film was heading. Frances’ character felt like at any moment the hammer was going to drop and something horrific was going to happen to her. The suspense of her safety was constantly in play, and I was expecting robbery or even murder at any given moment.

However once the film played out we are given the films overall thesis, the fact that out of all of this strife and hardship that ultimately this was all Frances choice. She chooses this lifestyle and that was a little bit of a sigh of relief knowing she wants this life and not being simply submitted to it out of hardship.

What stuck with me after watching this film was how intellectually honest it managed to be. The film never felt like it was trying to manipulate me into a specific POV, nor did it stoop to cliches or tropes it so easily could have ( nice stranger who turns out to be evil, accosting teenagers and the like) the film was simply confident in its narrative and just sort of goes with it, it doesn’t force anything narratively or any message down our throats. It just IS. 

For that reason that reason the film really stuck with me. I find it so interesting and unique that I almost didn’t enjoy the film while watching it but enjoyed it so much more after the fact.",1644364138.0

smqfky,The Lord of the Rings trilogy spoiled us with its rich dialogue. No other recent blockbuster has come close,3773,0.85,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smqfky/the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy_spoiled_us_with_its/,790,"We all know that the Lord of the Rings trilogy changed blockbuster cinema: In terms of production, special effects and spectacle, it set the standard that blockbusters have followed since. Big armies lining up for battle, huge sets and fantastical vistas, and all manner of CGI monsters and creatures. 

In my opinion, however, no other blockbuster since has even approached having the same sort of elevated, beautiful dialogue we see in LOTR. Mostly taken from Tolkien, but occasionally created whole cloth by Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, the trilogy is littered with beautiful soliloquies, monologues, speeches and diatribes that go well beyond the average Hollywood film and into the realm of high art. 

No other blockbuster since has even attempted to have such elevated, poetic and descriptive prose make up it's dialogue, and that's honestly really tragic. Many of the best scripted moments in the trilogy sound like they could have come straight from a Shakespearean tragedy, and this sort of writing shows you can combine big spectacle with literate prose and still find success with the audience. 

Some examples of my favourite lines from the films:

**The Two Towers**

Gandalf: ""*The veiling shadow that glowers in the East takes shape.  Sauron will suffer no rival! From the summit of Barad-Dur his eye watches ceaslessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; Doubt ever gnaws at him. Rumour has reached him; the heir of Numenor still lives.*""

Gandalf"" *Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth! I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!*""  

Théoden: ""*What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread! If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!*""

**The Return of the King**

Saruman: ""*You have fought many wars and slain many men, Theoden King, and made peace afterwards. Can we not take council as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace?*""

Theoden: ""*We shall have peace... We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they died against the gates of the Hornberg are avenged! When you hang from a gibbit for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace.*”

Denethor: ""*You think you are wise, Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me!*"" 

Gandalf: ""*All has turned to vain ambition! He would even use his grief as a cloak!*""

Theoden: ""*Arise, arise, riders of Théoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world’s ending! Death! Death! Death! Forth Èorlingas!*""

Their costs, while very moderate for a film company, (5 million and 9 million), is actually really huge for a single person. M Night had to refinance his house or some shit to pay for The Visit.

Now those films are box office hits. They grossed 100 mil and 280 mil respectively, but as I know it, he had to find a buyer for the film, find distribution, and no doubt paramount pictures or walt disney or whatever probably took a huge chunk of the profits.

My question is, on a very, very, rough estimate, how much money would you say M Night made from The Visit and Split, given that he had to finance it all himself?

Split- costs: 9 million, box office: 280 million
The Visit- costs: 5 million, box office: 100 million.",1644411158.0

smzkqv,"Any fans of Mouse Hunt (1997) with Nathan Lane, Lee Evans & Christopher Walken?",725,0.93,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smzkqv/any_fans_of_mouse_hunt_1997_with_nathan_lane_lee/,135,"I never see this film talked about these days, which is a shame because it's really good & really funny. This was always one of my favorite 90s comedies & one of my all-time favorite comedies, always found it to be so underrated at the time & I still rewatch it every now and again. It had a great cast: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, Ernie Sabella, Vicki Lewis, Michael Jeter, William Hickey among others. And it had some really hilarious scenes: for me, my favorites were: the opening funeral scene, the chimney scene, the auction, the restaurant scene, the scene with the cat and any scene with Christopher Walken had me in tears laughing, so funny. 

The scene >!where Ernie's in the chimney, Lars lights the match & it causes an explosion because the mouse took the plug out, the explosion sends Lars back in the drawer & sends Ernie halfway across the pond, then later when he gets out, they start communicating without saying any words, that entire scene never fails to make me laugh. And when the mouse gets the better of Christopher Walken's character Caesar is great too. ""What's that? HORSE?! FIENDISH! I WON'T EAT IT!"" xD!<

And there were some nice references to >!The Lion King as well, which of course, Nathan Lane starred in, there's a cameo from Ernie Sabella, Pumbaa, he's the one that shows them Catzilla lol. Then later on in the film when Ernie (Lane) introduces himself to some at the auction, he says: ""Hakuna Matata."" !<Always thought that was a nice touch. :)

I was shocked to see that it had a 44% on Rotten Tomatoes tbh. I remember back in the day, some fans likened Lane & Evans' comedic chemistry to Laurel & Hardy, not sure if it was intentional but I liked that as a fan of Laurel & Hardy. Anyway, what did you think of this comedy? Do you find it to be underrated? What were your favorite scenes in the film? Who were your favorite characters in the film?",1644264644.0

snllqd,I loved The treasure of the sierra madre,23,0.8,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snllqd/i_loved_the_treasure_of_the_sierra_madre/,11,"I was looking for a movie to watch, and landed on the 1948 classic the treasure of the sierra madre, directed by John Huston. the movie follows Fred C Dobbs, as played by Humphrey Bogart, and his search for gold in the Mexican mountains. He is accompanied by his friend  Curtin who he made while living rough in the streets of Mexico, and they are led in the expedition by the wise old adventurer Howard, played beautifully by the Director's father, Walter Huston. The movie is only on the surface about gold, and is more a study of what wealth and greed can drive a man to do. Despite the movie having being made more than seventy years ago, it still captured my attention with the wonderful acting and clever plot. just when you feel a plotline is dragging too long they change direction and keep you intrigued with an unexpected twist.  Fred Dobbs' character, brilliantly played by Humphrey Bogart, who bragged that gold would not change him, is probably how any of us would behave if we had the great fortune of winning the lottery, and it is the other two of the team who show their true colors. All in all, a tremendous film which I heard inspired Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood. Can anyone recommend similar old movies that capture your attention like this one did?",1644330653.0

so0s3p,"Mechanical ""horror"" done well?",4,0.58,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so0s3p/mechanical_horror_done_well/,8,"This is pretty niche, but I just watched ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""Jaws"" back to back, and among other things I was struck by how well both films convey a sense of the sheer mechanical brutality of inanimate objects and how vulnerable human beings are in comparison. Ropes snapping and slicing through flesh, barrels splashing and sliding over decks and rigs, dynamite and gas cylinders, close attention to the inner workings of trains and boats and mines and oil rigs. In ""Jaws"" this ""mechanical"" horror is often more effective than the ""biological"" horror of the shark, IMO. 

I'm not sure if I'm making sense but this depiction of raw, senseless, dehumanising physical forces across the two films was really cool to compare. Things like the beach scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are similar but, y'know, that's explicitly a war film where brutality is expected. Both ""TWBB"" and ""Jaws"" are of course brutal, but in quite a different way from violent war films. Likewise, intentional ""mechanical horror"" like ""Tetsuo: Iron Man"" is tasteless by comparison. 

Any recommendations for other films (or just particular scenes) where this physical brutality of inanimate objects is conveyed particularly well?",1644369897.0

1. Why Susie painted her mouth white? I mean the symbolism. I want to know all the symbolism and the Easter eggs of the movie. 

2. What did Olga had something in her eyes before she get out? And why did she followed the voice calling her instead of getting out?

3. Why did they wear red rope like clothes for dancing and why no one in audience went out and talk anything about the Sara incident?

4. In the movie when the psychiatrist went to see the police, he said you helped me find my wife and said he'll always be grateful. But then she died long back. What is it?

5. Why did they had a fish hook kinda thing? Is it some common witch thing?

6. How did Patricia escape? Given that there is no way they would let someone out especially with all the data in diary. 

7. Where does the psychiatrist go? To that old home for something. Is that his house?  Does he not live in clinic? And who is the woman sitting in the lawn of that house?

8. What happened to Blanc? She's still alive? 

9. Is there any theory on childhood of Susie? 

10. Why give the girls nightmare?

The animation is gorgeous and I drool over it the entire time. The concepts and ideas at work are really cool and interesting. The aesthetics and design of the whole thing is great.

This is now my second time watching it start to finish. The opening is really great and I love the stuff with the biker gangs. The ending is really excellent and the final confrontation with Tetsuo, Kaneda, and Akira is really cool. It should work but it just doesn't. It feels like there is just this one missing piece  that doesn't tie it all together like it should. 

Maybe it's the characters? I'm not super in love with Tetsuo and Kaneda and their gang.

We love movies and thought it would be fun to look back on our picks once the official noms come out. Stumbled upon the word doc last week and wanted to see how our predictions were holding up so far and I thought this community might enjoy it. 

We *only* looked at the name of the film, the cast/director attached at the time, the studio, and one to two sentences about the plot. It's interesting seeing how off we were on some and how we actually weren't too wrong on some others. I also included some data from the last 27 years of Best Picture winners: RT critic score, RT audience score, and the average of those two numbers to compare to how the films are looking compared to past winners.

For those interested in the historical info from Forrest Gump to Nomadland:

The average RT critic score over the past 27 films has been **88.2%**, the audience score **86.3%**, with the average of those two numbers being **87.3%**. I used those numbers as a loose talking point when discussing how I think a movie might do in the Best Picture nom race. 

Just for shits and gigs, the lowest rated critic scored film to win Best Picture in the last 27 years was *Forrest Gump* with a rough 71% critic score. But it made up for it with a resounding 95% audience score to average out to 83%. Still decently below the average of all Best Picture winners, but still higher than some other winners (Braveheart 82%, Gladiator 82%, Crash 81%, and the Shape of Water 82%).

The lowest rated audience scored film to win Best Picture in the same time frame was *Titanic* with 69% audience score, *nice*. It landed at 89% with critics to put it at an average of 79% (if you trust the RT numbers on slightly dated films). If you believe the numbers, this is the ""worst"" Best Picture winner in the last 27 years.


# Ok now on to the post


We divided our picks into 3 categories:

* **Surely to get consideration**

* **Might get some strong looks**

* **Dark Horses**

# Surely to get consideration

* *Cantebury Glass* (New Regency) delayed to 2022: We didn't even know the plot to this one, but it had Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Robert De Niro, Timothy Olyphant, Rami Malek, and even the great Mike Myers signed on with Oscar winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Birdman, Children of Men, the Revenant, Gravity). Sounded like a Best Picture recipe to us. Unfortunately, the film has been pushed back to a 2022 release so we'll have to wait a bit to see if this one delivers.

* *The French Dispatch* (Searchlight Pictures) 74% critic, 76% audience, 75% average: Looking back on our list, we were really hot on Searchlight for some reason as this is the first of four films from the studio we would list. A Wes Anderson film with Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, and Timothee Chalamet. Seemed like it could be one to sneak in with some solid reviews and snag a nom. Unfortunately it underperformed and doesn't seem like it's in the running for a nom. I think we got a little too excited with the cast and thought Anderson may pull out the Isle of Dogs (90% critics, 87% audience) and Grand Budapest Hotel (92% critic, 86% audience) magic, but sadly it was not the case.

+ *House of Gucci* (UA) 62% critic, 83% audience, 72.5% average: lol. We got baited so hard by this one. Good director, great cast, interesting plot/setting. This film had crazy potential on paper. It would be the lowest rated critic and average score to win Best Picture if it somehow did, but I don't think it will get a nom at this point.

+ *Nightmare Alley* **Ayyy got one right!** (Searchlight) releasing in theaters 12/17: One guy in our group was a big del Toro fan and the cast was surprisingly heavy. Plot sounded just ""OK"" but it was early and there wasn't much detail out there. This one has a shot at nom, but what worries me is that we are a couple weeks out from release and have yet to see any reviews from advanced screenings. Macbeth is even further out and we are already getting glowing reviews coming in from early screenings. This film not being shown off early is a little concerning to me honestly, and I won't be shocked if it has a mild release and misses a nom.

+ *The Tragedy of Macbeth* **This one seems like the closest thing to a snub this season** (A24) 98% critic, releasing 12/25: Speaking of Macbeth, this was a no brainer back at the start of the year. Joel Coen, Denzel Washington (darling), Frances McDormand (darling), with an epic story. This was one of the easiest ones to add to the list and there as pretty much no debate among our group at all. Early reviews are crushing it. If the audience reviews are even remotely decent (82%+ range) I think this one is a lock for a Best Picture nom.

+ *West Side Story* **We got lucky and picked the right musical this year** (20th Century) releasing 12/10: Spielberg remaking an all-time classic musical in a time when musicals are the hottest they've been in several decades. Wasn't much more to say. A little worried that official reviews aren't out yet on a movie that releases in 9 days, but we'll see. There are some tweets from an early showing that are being thrown around, but early tweets are almost always promotional gumbly goo. If it lands on solid footing, it may have to compete with *In the Heights*, which had a very strong showing (but more on that later), for a Best Picture nom. At the start of the year we were confident it would be this one, but we may have it reversed.

+ *C'mon, C'mon* (A24) 95% critic, 83% audience, 89% average: We initially picked this one based on the Joaquin and A24 pairing combined with, what we thought, was an Oscar-baiting premise. Turns out we might have been right. Movie is crushing it with critics and doing solid with audiences too. It's falling in close to that ""winner"" range of scores that we've seen in the past, so I'm still expecting a nom for this one.

+ *Dune* **Not too shabby** (Warner Bros) 83% critic, 90% audience, 86.5% average: Our group had a pretty decent love of sci-fi and fantasy so we were really hoping this one lived up to the hype. It was kind of a roll of the dice when we were discussing this. It was back early in the year so there wasn't even a full trailer yet, just lots and lots of hype. We thought it would either bust or blow it wide open. Turns out it kind of landed in the middle. The audience score is really strong and is higher than that of many past winners, might not be enough though in a year with some solid candidates. It still might get a Best Picture nom (it will surely get them in other categories), but I'm not too optimistic on that. If the second one delivers on all the payoff that the first film has setup, it's possible we see a Lord of the Rings situation where the sequel ends up catching all the praise for the whole series and Dune 2 could walk away big.

+ *The Last duel* **I think the bad press and the release timing screwed this one** (20th Century) 85% critic, 81% audience, 83% average: At first glance this seemed like a no-brainer. Great cast, director, and premise. For whatever reason it just didn't pan out and now it's sitting with below average scores for a Best Picture winner and lots of bad press due to comments from the Director. I can still see it snagging a nom just because of the cast and director, but I would be utterly disappointed if it won.

# Might get some strong looks

These were our presumed 2nd tier contenders. Probably weren't going to snag a nom unless some films in the top tier goofed up (and they did). It's also the category we were off the most on.

+ *Annette* (Amazon) 71% critic, 76% audience, 73.5% average: We thought Amazon might return to their Sound of Metal and Manchester by the Sea glory, and hell if Casey Affleck could lead them to nom than surely Adam Driver could. That was the basis of our discussion. at least. We missed the mark on this one big. No nom in sight for this one sadly.

+ *Blonde* (Netflix) Delayed to 2022: A Marilyn Monroe biopic with Ana de Armas and Adrien Brody. Had *potential* on paper and it felt just like the kind of movie Netflix could release that get some real critical praise. Add in being produced by Brad Pitt and we thought we would have a winner. Sadly we won't get to know until next year as it has been delayed. 

+ *The Eyes of Tammy Faye* (Searchlight) 66% critic, 87% audience, 76.5% average: Great cast with a really interesting premise that seemed like was a perfect storm to snag a nom. Unfortunately it just didn't pan out. Audiences liked it fine, but with reviews from critics like those it's unlikely to sniff a Best Picture nom.

+ *In the Heights* **Took a gamble on West Side Story over this one** (Warner Bros) 94% critic, 94% audience, 94% average: Believe it or not this one was actually hard to place for us. On one hand Lin-Manuel Miranda is super hot right now, and on the other hand it's a musical and we thought that people might have Hamilton fatigue and not give this one its due. We were way off. Destroying critic and audience reviews, this one should have been in the highest tier and it seems maybe only West Wide Story could keep it from snagging a Best Picture nom (solely because I don't see two musicals occupying Best Picture slots in the same year).

+ *Next Goal Wins* (Searchlight) Delayed to 2022: A comedy by Taika Waititi with Michael Fassbender, Rachel House, and Armie Hammer about the American Samoa futbol team suffering the worst loss ever (31-0). Seemed like it might slip into the Jojo Rabbit niche of films and snag a nom if the cards fell just right. Now that it's delayed and with all the Armie Hammer stuff out there it might not happen (and obv not this year).

+ *Stillwater* (Focus) 74% critic, 72% audience, 73% average: Matt Damon working with Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) on a unique story seemed like the type of film to sneak in a Best Picture nom. It just didn't hit all the right boxes with fans and critics alike and likely won't be getting a nom even though there's a little room at the top.

# The Dark Horses

These were films that we thought may surprise in a big way and make a run. Actually ended up being one of our stronger categories as it stands now.

+ *The Courier* (Lionsgate) 85% critic, 95% audience, 90% average: Benedict has been everywhere, and while we didn't have it pegged as a sure thing this film is looking like it's in a really strong place for a Best Picture nom. Respectable 85% from critics and a mega missile of an 95% audience score. If there's room at the top, pencil this one in as your Dark Horse. Might be too crowded to find room, but I think Courier has better odds than others on the list.

+ *King Richard* **Always feels good when a dark horse pops off** (Warner Bros) 91% critic, 98% audience, 94.5% average: I'm a huge tennis fan and was really the only one making a case for this film early on. Couldn't justify putting it any higher at the time; we just felt the Will Smith star power wasn't quite there anymore and were hesitant on people being interested in the Williams' story with wanning interest in Serena and Venus. But man this one landed fast and hard. Smith killed it, and this one is absolutely on track for a Best Picture nom. Can't even consider this one a Dark Horse anymore.

+ *Red, White, and Water* (A24) delayed to 2022: We threw this one in as a dark horse based on Jennifer Lawrence and the plot. A US soldier suffers a traumatic brain injury while fighting in Afghanistan and struggles to adjust to life back home. Probably going to be a bust....but just maybe co- nah, in hindsight this was probably a bad pick, but at least I can't say we were wrong since it's getting delayed until 2022 >:]

+ *Respect* (UA) 67% critic, 95% audience, 81% average: This was the kind of movie that, on paper, had potential to make a run if the cards fell right. The story of Aretha Franklin starring Jennifer Hudson and Forest Whitaker. Films about music icons are big right now, so it had a path to a nom. Things just didn't pan out, and though audiences loved it, it's likely not getting a Best Picture nom.

+ *Soggy Bottom* aka *Licorice Pizza*  **Two from this category, not too shabby** (UA) 92% critic, 98% audience, 95% audience: Undergoing a name change just a couple months ago, this film hit the ground running and is now a sure bet for a Best Picture nom. Paul Thomas Anderson with a coming of age film set in the 70's. It was enough to bait me into labeling it a dark horse back in January and it seems the bet paid off. 


# Films we absolutely missed 

+ *The Power of the Dog*  **Great film, probably our biggest miss** (Netflix) 95% critic, 77% audience, 86% average: Not sure why this wasn't on our radar. Maybe it wasn't on the list we looked at or maybe the name just led us astray and kept us from looking further into it because we thought it was dog or children's movie. Regardless, this film is making waves and I won't be surprised if it gets a best picture nom.

+ *Belfast*  **Another big miss** (Focus) 87% critic, 92% audience, 89.5% average: We weren't too hyped on this one when we saw it come up at the start of the year honestly. It didn't seem that exciting but it seems like it pulled a reverse Mank (which was enjoyed by critics but loathed by audiences with a 83% critic score and 59% audience score) and is getting solid praise across the board. Probably going to snag a Best Picture nom.

+ *Coda* **Wasn't on our radar, but truly an awesome movie** (Apple) 96% critic, 93% audience, 94.5% average: Holy smokes this one came out of nowhere to us. A relatively unknown cast and a director mostly known for her writing, Coda is getting incredible reviews from all sides and is likely snagging Apple a Best Picture nom.

+ *Tick, Tick... BOOM!* **Kind of falling in snub range to me now** (Netflix) 88% critic, 95% audience, 91.5% average: This one also caught us by surprise. Andrew Garfield taking the screen by storm. Directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the third possible musical that could snag a Best Picture nom. It's a tough year to be a musical competing for Oscars. Could Netflix end up with two of the Best Picture noms?


+ **Don't Look Up - Honestly not sure this deserves a nom, but here it is. Think some other films on the list were more deserving like Macbeth and Tick, Tick, Boom!**
+ **Drive My Car - Haven't seen nor heard much about it, so not surprising we missed on it. Will check it out soon though**


+ **Honestly it's kind of funny. We guessed (in some capacity) 5 of the 10 noms a year out based solely on the names attached to the projects. Not a terrible outcome if you're a gambler. Although a 50% is a failure pretty much everywhere you go. What do you guys think?**

So yeah we missed the mark on a couple and missed several completely but overall it was fun seeing how things shaped out based on the little info we had at the start of the year. Anything catch you guys by surprise? You have big whiff like we did?",1644331990.0

It had some pretty spectacular setpieces and long takes but that only represents a pretty small portion of the movie.

Like this isnt even a very long movie and it really really genuinely felt like it could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.

Pretty weak characterization and lots of cheesy dialogue. Like the dialogue was unintentionally funny and made me laugh out loud numerous times. And theres one part where one of the main guys grabs some barbed wire and cuts his hand. But there was no good reason for him to grab the wire, and it was just a stupid way of injecting some conflict/drama into the story. At least thats how I recall that scene.

 Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called ""Wayne's World"" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of ""Wayne's World""—and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast—as well as the wild pop-culture references—make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie.

I can't deny how much I like this movie and I praise it for Whannell's directing style especially with his use of colors and darkness in Invisible Man. I know Whannell is probably known better for horror movies such as Insidious and Saw, but I was surprised to learn that Upgrade was getting a TV series and that he was directing a reboot for Escape from New York. I'm currently wondering when is Upgrade's TV show gonna air because I'm curious to see what direction Whannell goes in for this.

As a Whannell fan, I've been wondering if he would do some more action movies like James Wan. I would love to see him work with franchises such as Jump Street, Jason Bourne, Fast and Furious. Although I wonder if this could limit his creativity in contrast to Wan's considering the fact Wan not only worked and co created Insidious and Saw with him, but also helmed Furious 7 and Aquaman. Regardless of franchise or independent work, I was just wondering how do most of you feel about Whannell as an action director especially concerning Upgrade?

It seems there are many actors who were considered great and highly acclaimed at one time, but for whatever reason aren't as well remembered as some of their contemporaries. Two actors that come to mind are Paul Muni and Robert Donat. Both actors were similar to Daniel Day-Lewis due to the fact that both were academy award winning actors known for disappearing into their roles and considered the greatest actors from their time period. Both did not have a large filmography. Muni only did 23 films and Donat did only 20 films. 

Another example from later on was Montgomery Clift a great actor (with only 17 films) who seems to have suffered a similar fate since both Marlon Brando and James Dean (despite only starring in 3 films) appear more well known today than him. Clift was also considered the first true method actor to appear in films so it's kind of sad that actors who followed in his footsteps have eclipsed him.

 Both Muni and Donat are rarely mentioned or talked about even among classic film fans especially compared to their contemporaries like James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney. One would think their reputation and carefulness with selecting film roles would have been enough to keep their legacies thriving, but that didn't seem to be the case. One wonders if Day-Lewis will suffer a similar fate in the future.",1644311419.0

I finally went and watched House of Gucci yesterday with a couple of friends.

Full background: I’m Italian, born and raised in northern Italy in the late 80s, then moved to Germany 10 years ago.

I don’t know if it was nostalgia but I LOVED the movie. From the very beginning when the waiter drops 5000 Lire of change to the accents and the constant switching between Italian and English.

The language: it doesn’t make any sense, I get it. But it’s so entertaining. Someone said that the accent is not correct. What do they mean? It’s a complete fantasy, of course no Italian would speak like that. Because they’d speak Italian! But it’s immensely entertaining. Especially coming from older great starts like Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons. Even Jared Leto, I loved every instant where he’s on screen.

Adam driver and lady Gaga are so good at what they’re doing that I completely fell into the love story and forgot that >!shes gonna kill him!<.

In the end Ridley Scott is a 84 years old director that makes movies like no other. And I deeply enjoy them (I loved The Last Duel as well)

Agatha Christie is most renowned for her stories that explored the souls and passions of people however the retelling spends too much time and emphasis on evidence.

I thoroughly enjoy the movie and think it's very well done, but I struggle with my enjoyment of the source material (which I equally, if not more, enjoy) and this telling on the focus of evidence vs motive. I struggle because the message is different, when focused on evidence it is merely a mystery, however when focused on the people it is a story played out that can be experienced, no reader thinks themselves Poirot, but they find a different character among the suspects. In the movie they connect with only the sleuth (Poirot) trying to solve the murder.

Being the first sequel (or requel) in 10 years I figured something was going to tie from the original and cap it off. 

That something was Stu from the first film and boy did Scream 5 set that up only to not do it. Stu returning fits with the original scrapped sequel idea of him having new killers under him while jailed and it fits with what a long returning sequel or end film would do. Instead it looks like we are just getting Scream 6.

5 did so much stuff you would do in a last film except having the last final big moment. Meta statement on original returning, Billy's daughter and the hallucinations, Stu's house being the last location, the death of a legacy character, and Gales refusal to write anymore about the crimes. Dewey dieing to Stu or atleast because of Stu is way better and Gale possibly stopping future killers with not sensationalizing it is a great way to put an end on the series and yet its not the end.

All we needed was Stu to be mentoring the two psychos, face off with Sydney, and die with others not being written about. Great ending! And I really thought he was gonna pop out until the very end.

If six is our end (which it basically has to be) I feel like they wasted so much good end game stuff. 

The only avenue I see left is to dive into the idea of a series getting old and no one caring anymore, which could act as an end. But it of course needs old Sydney and Stu.

There’s a lot of characters, scenes move back and forth in time and while there’s some exposition it’s limited. If you’re not paying attention it’s easy to get lost. It’s not a flashy film, it reveals itself slowly over time. It’s funny to think that technically this and a Bond movie would be both considered spy films, because it’s so far from the theatrics of those films. No gadgets, no campy villain, no countdown timer to a bomb about to explode. It feels like what real spy craft would be like. Slow, methodical and low key. 

All of the above is also why it gets better with multiple viewings. The direction is really well considered and confident. The connections between the characters get clearer with multiple viewings. Of course the performances are sublime which is no surprise given the cast.

So I was shocked to see it didn’t get a best picture nomination. Even in a year which had the longer nomination list. This is absolutely an Oscar worthy film IMO and I hope it continues to gain more regard over time.

so2zrc,My Idea For A Scifi Trilogy,0,0.33,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so2zrc/my_idea_for_a_scifi_trilogy/,8,"I dream of becoming a filmmaker and focus on practical effects, and Star Wars is a huge inspiration for me to want to make films. If I made my own space opera film, it would be a small group of space mercenaries flying around in a Millennium Falcon inspired freighter. They would be known as The Marauders. This franchise would also have a big toyline featured many action figures, vehicles, and a few playsets. The titles of these films would be:

The Marauders 

The Mauraders: Shadows of Warfare 

The Marauders: Unifying Force

The Maruaders members would consist of a flame thrower specialist named Kyle Savo, a talented teenage engineer and medic named Emily Veronis, an elite sniper named Bryce Kiness, a heavy weapons expert named Amadeus Xizor.

Kyle Savo worked for the evil Zeta Empire and was a flame trooper that went rogue (kinda like Finn from the sequels). He steals an experimental suit of advanced armor with a built in heat beam canon. He is a psychopath that loves jazz, much like Io Flemming from Gundam Thunderbolt.

Emily Veronis was an orphaned child who had her planet conquered and she was tortured and experimented on by the Zeta Empire. They eventually tampered with her genetic make up with a highly intelligent alien species, which caused her mutate and gain some physical characteristics of that species as well as some new abilities, most notably super intelligence. She used this to her advantage to escape and stop the mutation from spreading. With her intelligence she crafts many advanced and complex technologies and is immensely knowledgeable with medicine and machinery. She is agile, however she is physically weak. She also struggles with self acceptance after what she has experienced. 

Bryce Kiness is the leader of the group and captain of the the freighter. He is doesn't like to go guns and blazes when he isn't  flying his ship, and has a calm and humble personality. He is a former bounty hunter for the Republic but quit after realizing after all fo the horrible atrocities they have committed.

Amadeus Xizor worked with Bryce as a bounty hunter and copilot. He is a trigger happy individual and gets angry very easily. However deep inside he really cares for his allies.

As for the politics, the galaxy's core government is a republic similiar to Star Wars. Decades before the events of the Maruaders Trilogy, the Zeta Empire waged war in hopes of conquering the entire galaxy. The empire was defeated, but they were given a decent amount of the galaxy to rule for themselves. A few years before the events of the first Mauraders movie the Republic gets more and more paranoid of the empire that they start committing violent atrocities to their planets in order to maintain control.

Meanwhile, the Empire has been preparing for another war in their area and started to rely on Red Abyss, a criminal organization with the most advanced technology in the galaxy, lead by the crim lord Kannos Zenith. Seeing how the galaxy's republic is in turmoil they use this chance to strike with sheer force, capturing some planets in the process. There are no good guys or bad guys in the story, just two horribly corrupt governments. The Maruaders are hired for the Republic but as they go through and adventures, they see that both sides are corrupt, they realize war is a gray area. 

Towards the end of the trilogy, The Marauders find out that Red Abyss is giving supplies to the Republic as well, and at this point Red Abyss becomes so powerful that they betray both the Zeta Empire and the Republic with their incredible weapons and technology far more advanced than the Zeta Empire or the Republic. The two governments make the difficult decision to join forces and take out this greater evil in a final battle on the Red Abyss's home planet, with The Maruader leading the operation. As the fleets of the Zeta Empire, Republic, and Red Abyss rip each other to shreds, The Mauraiders raid the Red Abyss headquarters and have an intense final battle with the Kannos who is armed to the teeth to take on the heroes.

After the battle, the war comes to a close, and the Zeta Empire and Republic merge into a Galactic Federation in order to maintain peace. The Maruaders decide to live together aboard their freighter, and together they become ambassadors of the Federation.

I think there are about 7 puppies(not exactly sure about the number).

One detail I remember is that during the film the dogs can speak our language( well i am sure they go woof woof and  they are just voiced in our language.I am not sure if that made any sense)

In the beginning when they all meet at their usual hang out place,one of the puppy wanders off chasing something(i guess).Then these other puppies see him and go after him.

There also some bad guys who try to steal these puppies in between 

Also it is not an animated film

I am not even sure if this is an English film as I watched it dubbed in my native language(telugu)

Why?

First off, why wouldn't he say, ""She is alive"" if he is implying that Eloise will see her, or that ""She the one who killed"", based on the fact that he views that house as ""hell"", which I'm assuming has to do with the possibility that he investigated the murders/disappearance of the men.

More importantly, why would he imply Alex killed Sandy? Eloise can see ghosts, but I felt like it's such a stretch to include the ghost of Sandy, who is a metaphor for the countless ""deaths"" she endured, let alone that the detective (who the only show them speaking once), also understands the metaphorical deaths of Sandy?

The entire movie is based on th facts that she can see/become ghost/travel in time (I actually don't know) and the ghost she sees, isn't actually dead (also, why the false vision when everything else was real?).

Personally, I would have had it so the viewer thought they were seeing the ghost of Sandys life up until her ""death"", where Eloise would wake up and be to afraid to sleep in the house to see the end of the murder. Eventually she would return, which would then reveal that Sandy was alive and was actually seeing through the eyes of Jack, who wants revenge for his murder.

Don't get me wrong, Wag the Dog is a great movie, and he doesn't really ruin the movie at all (especially given he's only in it for about 5 minutes), it's just...

I don't know...

His casting felt a little off to me? Like the character was written as a more ""smooth, charismatic figure"" yet he was still doing his abrasive shtick? Like he sounded less like he was genuinely excited about all the marketing opportunities the fake war could bring and more like he was pretending to be excited but was about to strangle DeNiro and Hoffman?

I don't know, it felt more like a character Robert Downey Jr. or Eddie Murphy should be playing than Denis Leary.

It didn't really matter, though, because everyone else was cast well, especially Willie Nelson in the same scene.

Its a story of Evil ( Crowe ) and Good ( Bale ) journey together to earn redemption.

Both sons are chasing their fathers through out the movie. Following their foot steps. 

Both have different views of their father. Prince loves Evil and doesn’t question his guidance. The young boy thinks of his father as a loser but is devoted. 

Prince starts the film in this pure white outfit and by the end its bloody and filthy. Being murdered by his leader Evil. Showing his white clothes turn dark is an awesome way to explain blind devotion leads to corrupting of purity. While the young boy who questioned his fathers ways witnesses his father die a hero and redeems his view of him. 

Good and Evil form a bond as well. Good learns from Evil there is no right or wrong only success or failure. Evil leans from Good hope exists and by helping Good complete his mission Evil can redeem himself. Both are seeking inner peace through redemption.

Still, we started thinking of all the musicals we know, and we couldn't find a single one that had a credible, sound, and interesting plot, despite most of them being pretty enjoyable.

I think that they should give a digital copy (or a big discount for the physical/digital) when it's out of the ""billboard""  for everyone who has watched on the cinema. It won't affect the physicial media revenue as it's a different business focused on collectors and so on.

"" Where going to eat and enjoy this as a family, so dig in""

I saw movies which are racist or sexist or homophobic - but I think this is the first time that a film manages to be excellent in all of these categories.

Seriously, this movie tries it's very best to show a world with as many ways to put people into  categories as possible. ""Fag"" and ""faggot"" are common language, there are supposed-to-be-funny rants about a chinese exchange student who is ALWAYS introduced with a loud gong sound when shown (like wtf). Stupid Molly Ringwald is all whining about not getting laid but at the same is right on a bitch to a guy who wants the same, and we are supposed to identify with her? Sure, 16 years olds mostly just want to get laid but this movie cherishes this superficial way of thinking instead of saying like ""Look how stupid we were as teens"". Hell, it even ends with a passed out girl who is traded by his boyfriend against a pair of underwear so the horny ""geek"" can sleep-creep (aka rape) her - that's seriously how it is!

I can't even believe I'm writing a rant post - especially after Ringwald herself spoke out against the film ([https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink)).

And that John Hughes may be one of the great filmmakers - but also made some real pieces of shit.

Has anyone had the opportunity to watch When Harry Met Sally on Amazon Prime? If you haven't, I really wouldn't bother. 

That's not a mark against When Harry Met Sally, either. This is truly one of the best films of all time. But for whatever reason, most probably licencing, the soundtrack to this film is altered on Amazon Prime. This may be the case on other streaming services, too. 

The most egregious case of this is the absence of Frank Sinatra's 'It Had To Be You' at the film's most pivotal moment between Harry and Sally. In its place is a jazz number, which might be enjoyable were it not for its terrible misuse here. This, please beware of spoilers here, is the famous scene of Harry confessing his love for Sally. 

I am totally struck by how much of an effect this change has when viewing with the knowledge of the original song. I'd be interested to see a person's emotional reaction to the scene whose first time seeing it is via Amazon, yet so far when recommending to friends I've been sure to steer them clear of the Amazon version. 

Why this change has been made, I do not know. Licencing seems the obvious answer, yet this confuses more; with the greatest of respect, the music of Frank Sinatra is widely heard in films ranging from the fantastic to the mediocre, high budget to low budget. Why one of the greatest films of all time, which arguably has the greatest use of Sinatra's music in all of cinema, would have to change its soundtrack in this way is beyond me. More baffling still is the completely uninspiring replacement. After looking it up I've seen very little commentary on this change, and certainly none from director Rob Reiner himself. I imagine, and have to believe, Reiner had no input on this decision. 

Anyways, has anyone else noticed this? Furthermore, does anyone know of any similar examples of soundtrack changes which completely alter the emotional impact of a scene/film?",1644265672.0

And it is also a zombie movie way out of the ordinary; it is set in Africa, something you don't see every day. But if you have read David Wellington's ""Monster"" trilogy, then you will love this movie.

Let me say that the African setting was really a nice breath of fresh air in the zombie genre. It worked so well, because it was miles after miles of savanna and badlands. No big skyscrapers here, no high-tech underground facilities, no narrow and winding dark alleys. A couple of villages though, so it was cool.

However, one thing that puzzled me in ""The Dead"" was the amount of zombies that were shambling about in the savanna. I would have assumed that there wouldn't be that many walking around in the middle of nowhere. Near the villages, yes, but in the middle of the savanna, no! And oddly enough every time the two main characters in the movie stopped somewhere, there were suddenly (and always!) a group of zombies shambling in to attack them. That was so stupid. But I guess it was the simplest way to work in a heap of zombies into the story.

Basically the story revolves around two people only. But it works out well enough, despite the movie moving ahead at a fairly slow speed. But that was not a bad thing, because the movie was far from boring. Just don't expect speed, action and lots of adrenalin, though.

The cast in ""The Dead"" was nice and they did good jobs with their roles. And the two lead roles were well cast.

One thing that could have improved the movie for me, was if the zombies had glazed over milky eyes instead of those weird white eyes; it just didn't really make them have that classic zombie/dead person look. But hey, it was a minor thing. It is just me that pays attention to the small details.

All in all, ""The Dead"" was really a great movie and it was really nice to see this type of approach to the zombie genre. So thumbs up for the movie makers. And if you are a zombie aficionado like me, then you definitely want to check out ""The Dead"".",1644276111.0

I was very surprised by the low scores the movie received on Rotten Tomatoes and Audience scores. (56% and 78% respectively)  I love satire.  It’s one of my favorite types of movies and books , and I love when juxtaposition is utilized.    Some writers say: “wow them in the end” and this movie really hit home in its last line: “We Had Everything”.    Which is so true of today: we have smart phone (well smart everything). Families can be who they want.  We have freedom to choose our paths in life.  And the movie taught us to look at the smaller thing we take for granted— Albeit an old lesson but it’s one we tend to forget and need reminders for.  And this movie did just that.  “We had coffee” .  It was kinda a perfect way to end that scene and the movie overall. .  It was warm and heartfelt; the line was delivered perfectly by our lead.  Which is why I’m dumbfounded by the low scores.    Why do you think the movie wasn’t received well by critics and the general population.

There's been major influence going back and forward in time as some factions in the story do count with plate armour and longswords while others don't and I'm aware that that kind of equipment came later, more around the 15th to 16th century .

**What I'm looking for is inspiration both narrative and cultural, apart from set and costume design.**

I don't mind watching things that are a few hundred years off since it can still provide ideas for apparel design and architecture. The XIV cen. focus is only for getting an idea of what the culture was like.

Right now my list of what I intend to watch to take screenshots of and study includes

The Man in the Iron Mask (both 1998 and 1977, late 1600s France, still going to check it out for the castles and dungeons)

A Knight's Tale (2001, I know, still going to watch it)

Black Death (2010)

Excalibur (1981, this one likely is far in the past of the time period I'm interested in, if I'm not mistaken, though, but a quick glance through showed that it has plate armour even though the legend of Arthur places him around cen. VI? It's based on a XVI century play so maybe that's why) 

Henry V (1944 and 1989, also a bit modern in setting)

Joan of Arc (1948, The Trial of 1962, The Messenger 1999, the other 1999 one, The Passion of 1928, Joan the Maid 1 & 2 1994)

Kingdom of Heaven (director's cut 2005)

Outlaw King (2018)

Pope Joan (2009, a few centuries prior to the main focus I have)

Rob Roy (1995, I know this one is 1700s Ireland but there might be something in there)

Robin Hood (1991, 2010, Prince of Thieves 1991, The Adventures of 1938)

snbk6q,Was Revenge of the Nerds (1984) intentionally made with discrimination parallels in mind?,0,0.48,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snbk6q/was_revenge_of_the_nerds_1984_intentionally_made/,20,"It might seem obvious, Revenge of the Nerds is a movie about a specific group of people (the Nerds), standing up to their bullies/persecutors (the Jocks, et. al).


However, I am unable to find if there was directorial intention with using the Lambda Lambda Lambda Fraternity (a mostly Black American fraternity) as the segue in which the Nerds would eventually rise to stand up against their persecution.


We can even see in Gilbert and Lewis’s speech at the end of the film parallels being made between the hardships of Black Americans during the Civil Rights Movement and now the Nerds nearly 20 years later, and the African Americans are there to defend the Nerds because they are very much aware of the actual difficulty of persecution.


To summarize, I want to know if you think that this was an intentional directorial consideration to acknowledge real systemic issues in America, or if this just happens to be a compelling coincidence. It would be impressive if it was an intentional move, especially in an otherwise raunchy comedy classic.


Note: This post is not meant to compare to or minimize the hardships experienced by those in the Civil Rights Movement and those who still experience racial injustice today. It is primarily to discuss whether or not it was a directorial decision to use this film to parallel that hardship.",1644296159.0

Obviously the writing is on point, but for me there was an ""aha"" moment about halfway through the film that ties back into the title of the movie (I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but think of ""Moonfall"" as two words instead of one). Really smart stuff there, I enjoy when a director trusts his audience to connect the dots on their own.

I loved the symbolism in the film as well. It's subtle, but you can really see how Roland wanted to create an allegory for our modern times when our heroes are dodging asteroids in their Mercedes SUV (Who among us hasn't been there these last two years)

Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are in top form here with their back and forth banter. Just top notch banter. Can't say enough good things about their banter. I know its early in the year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar nod for one or both of them.

It feels anticlimactic and kills the momentum entirely. I remember seeing Psycho on Netflix and they didn’t even let them pulling the car out of the lake before already recommending me the sequel. It’s such a small thing, but it frustrates me every time. 

I get that streaming services are usually not made for old films, but cmon, am I the only one who is bothered by this? I mean, with superhero films they always wait till the last credit scene before starting with the recommendations, so why not do the same thing with old films? Just wait five seconds more and the ending will be much more satisfying. I hope at least *one* streaming service will fix that someday. Until then I’ll just have to rely on physical media. 

Rant over.


Edit: Wow, didn’t expect this to get so much attention. I initially intended this post to be a rant about how old movies are made unwatchable by the autoplay interruption, but it seems like many people have issues with autoplay for all kinds of movies and shows. I didn’t even think about modern movies with proper end credits while writing this post (maybe I’ve just gotten used to it), but I agree, it can be just as irritating as with the case I made. I’m very happy to (if unintentionally) shine some light on this whole issue. 😃",1644103321.0

Have also done online searches but it's all just ""we don't know where or when yet"". It's meant to be out in a week and a half...surely someone knows something by now?

As old as Batfleck is he proved every hater wrong when he did one of the best superhero fight scenes in film. Another one is the chase scene in Terminator 3. While its nowhere near as good as T2 it's still pretty solid. The whole thing with Arnold hanging onto the crane and the sheer intensity of Kristina Loken makes that scene pretty well done.,1644265009.0
smzakw,Recent 80s style child abduction crime movie? Help,1,0.54,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smzakw/recent_80s_style_child_abduction_crime_movie_help/,4,"Half a year ago I watched a trailer on youtube for what looked like a new crime drama. 

The movie was set in the 80s, so comparable in the style to ""it"" and ""stranger things"". What little I could gather from the trailer it seemed to be about the investigation into a child kidnapper. The/one kidnapping was shown in the trailer and if I remember correctly showed a boy on a bike who saw a man drop a box of things (maybe toys) onto the sidewalk. He stopped to help the man pick up the things which is when he was kidnapped. The kidnapper was dressed in black, was driving a black van and I believe also had some black balloons. 

thats what I can remember - it was over pretty quickly and by now quite a while ago.

I never found out what that movie was but as someone who loves crime dramas and 80s nostalgia it seemed like a movie for me.

Best Director: Id love Julia Ducournau getting in, but since she likely won't at all, I am hoping Spielberg makes it and a possible nomination for Del Toro and Coen would be nice but not happening at all.

Best Actor: I'd love if Rex, Phoenix, Cage, and Dinklage made it but none are happening now.

Best Actress: where to begin here? was Praying Stewart, Haim, and Reineve would all make it but only one likely will, in a very awesome world we'd see Comer, Rousseau, and Thompson all contending as well as Cruz.

Best Supporting Actor: hoping Cooper, Faist, Affleck, Leto, and Pacino much more over Hinds are five but most likely the last two might be our alone contenders, in a perfect awesome world would love to maybe have a Lindon nomination.

Best Supporting actress: won't happen but possibly Moreno sneaking and Debose or Negga win.",1644277136.0
