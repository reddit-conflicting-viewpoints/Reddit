t7bjyw,Willem Dafoe's performance in The Lighthouse is the most entertaining performance I have seen in ages.,Discussion,9862,0.95,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t7bjyw/willem_dafoes_performance_in_the_lighthouse_is/,517,"The Lighthouse is a weird film and Dafoe's character is even weirder. But does Dafoe do a stupendous job in selling his character. From the sailor speak to his accent to delivering lengthy monologues seamlessly and displaying an artillery of expressions, Dafoe hits each scene perfectly.

Robert Pattinson is not far behind as he does a great job too. It's just that Dafoe's character is more interesting and Dafoe just takes it many notches up. Even in some serious scene I was smiling as to how entertaining the character was.

I think it was a snub for Dafoe, deserved a supporting act nomination for that performance.",1646493422.0

Flâneur types!",Recommendation,36,0.78,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t798t3/films_with_characters_that_are_alone_but_not/,32,"I'm looking for films where characters are more loners in the world, but it ain't a bad thing. They're happy with themselves and love spending time alone. These open-minded people get along with others well in general but ultimately they are their own best friend and the fact that they can be happy alone like that, is simply magical.

Kinda hard to pinpoint this exact sorta feeling I want but some flâneur action would be great! Characters that loves spending their time experiencing the world through their lens and meeting people, but at the end of the day, love to wind down with a glass of wine alone. Or maybe end the night tearing up (happy tears) over how beautiful the Tokyo city skyline is... alone.

Not looking for a depressing film about loneliness. There is a key difference here. I'm looking for something more inspirational and beautiful. It's beautiful when people are in touch with themselves on such a deep level like that.

These loners love (but not limited to) nature, views, city skylines, neon lights, intimate bars, exploring off the beaten path areas, sunrises, sunsets, connecting with real souls, dining alone etc.

I dunno if the vibe I'm going for will make sense to y'all, but hopefully it does. You know those independent people you meet that are adventurous and are just happy doing their own thing? That!

The movie has so much more going for it than its basic premise and sci-fi future setting - that's what makes it work so incredibly well. At its heart it is a noir detective thriller and the way it weaves that with science fiction is perfect. It doesn't rely on the precognition as a gimmick - but instead makes it central to more individual, personal questions about individual choice vs predeterminism.

At times Spielberg can be a little heavy handed with fatherhood themes (e.g. War of the Worlds) but here, again, it marries perfectly with the plot and feels more authentic.

I was going to say Anton Chigurh but I find him more intriguing than scary. There isn't a single moment Frank Booth is on screen in *Blue Velvet* where it doesn't feel like he's about to strangle someone. He's the human manifestation of a pipe bomb ready to blow at any second, and I think that's hammered home by how the slightest provocation or questioning of his authority is enough to make him fly off the handle. He's the second most depraved character I've ever seen in a film.

Lou Bloom is a fucking monster, maybe even worse than Booth was. He acts like a conehead or some other humanoid alien from a comedy film, in the way that he has absolutely no understanding of human conventions and societal standards. There's a scene towards the beginning of the movie where that one guy says ""i'm not hiring a thief"" and Lou Bloom gives him this confused look, as if he genuinely didn't understand that that's how the world works. Everything he says to anyone feels rehearsed and riddled with ulterior motives.

Sometimes PG-13 may even be benefited to the film, Like those murdering scene that it would just be a gory fest if it was Rated-R, But because it was a PG-13 film so they have to make sure people know what happaned there without using real footage like using Shadow, Noises or Blood, I think those are much more creative solution than just showing a gore fest",1646454150.0

t7gykq,[Official] $120 Million-Plus Domestic Box Office Opening for ‘The Batman’,News,2,0.56,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t7gykq/official_120_millionplus_domestic_box_office/,13,"[(The Wrap)](https://www.thewrap.com/the-batman-120-million-plus-box-office-opening/)
Warner Bros. earns only the second $100 million-plus opening since theaters reopened and the studio’s first since September 2017

“The Batman” has proved to be exactly the box office jolt that Warner Bros. and movie theaters hoped it would be, earning $57 million from 4,417 locations on opening day as estimates project a domestic opening weekend of over $120 million. 

Not only does that put “The Batman” alongside “Spider-Man: No Way Home” as just the second film since the pandemic began to open to over $100 million, that also makes it the first Warner Bros. release in over four years to top that mark. The last title from the Burbank studio to do so was “It” was a $123 million opening back in September 2017, though “Joker” came close with $96 million in October 2019. 

The month ahead for “The Batman” is looking very bright considering that no major blockbusters will be coming out until Sony’s “Morbius” on April 1, leaving it plenty of room to leg out. The film will have incredibly strong word-of-mouth to fuel those legs — 85% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, 4.5/5 on Postrak and an A- on CinemaScore — along with its theatrically exclusive status after Warner Bros. spent all of last year releasing films in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously.

With “The Batman” taking approximately 80% of all estimated box office revenue this weekend, holdover totals for all other films are small. But Sony’s “Uncharted” is holding decently in its third weekend given the competition with an estimated $12.4 million total. That will make the Playstation adaptation the fourth Sony film to gross over $100 million in North America since this past October. 

MGM/FilmNation’s “Dog” is in third with an estimated $6.5 million in its third weekend, giving the low-budget comedy a domestic total of $40 million. “Spider-Man: No Way Home” stays in the top 5 with $4.7 million in its 12th weekend, with 20th Century’s “Death on the Nile” in fifth with $2.85 million in its fourth weekend.

If you haven't seen it, please, stop reading and start looking in your agenda for a time where you're going to have 4 free hours in a day, and seek this movie out.

It follows a 13-year-old boy in 1960s Taiwan called Zhan Zheng(nickname Si'r)as he gets in trouble with his best friend in school and gets somewhat involved in a gang war, so the film is way, way more than that but i BEG YOU to read no further about this film and watch it as soon as you can.

Now, for those who've already seen it.

This movie is the biggest, longest, most painful time-bomb ever.
Much like its protagonist, it doesn't reveal its true intentions right until the last moments. It ticks, for a very long time, and when it explodes, it hits harder than anything, ever.

A Brighter Summer Day resembles that feeling of wanting to shout something out in the air--but not being able to, to reserve your profound necessity to cry, a feeling which i'm sure a lot of people will have felt.

Unfortunately, i don't think you can grasp the entirety of this movie on a single watch--which is not the film's fault, on the contrary, it's such a dense film that tackles such complex things with such patience, the viewer is just intellectually inferior to Edward Yang, and it's hard to understand every one of the things he's trying to say.

By the way, Edward Yang, he really was a genius. Like, really. This is the first film from him that i watch and, it's true, he was a huge, huge loss. Every single one of his films has gone to the top of my watchlist.",1646486002.0

*See also:* [*Thriller film*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film)

Featuring guns, explosions, elaborate, and apocalypse set pieces, this movie type first developed in the 1970s in such films as [*Dirty Harry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry) and [*The French Connection*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_(film))*,* and became the exemplar of the Hollywood mega-blockbuster in the 1980s in such works as [*Die Hard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard) and [*Lethal Weapon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Weapon). These films often feature a race against the clock, lots of violence, and a clear—often flamboyantly evil—antagonist. Though they may involve elements of crime or mystery films, those aspects take a back seat to the action. Other significant works include [*Hard Boiled*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Boiled), [*Point Break*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Break_(1991_film)), [*The Warriors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(film)), [*Bullitt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullitt), [*The Seven-Ups*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven-Ups), [*Cobra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_(1986_film)), [*Taken*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(film)), and [*John Wick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick).[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film#cite_note-49)

A subgenre of the action film, [martial arts films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts_films) contain numerous [hand-to-hand combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-to-hand_combat) scenes between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value and are often the method of storytelling, character expression, and development. Martial arts films contain many characters who are [martial artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_artists). These roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors usually fervently train in preparation for their roles. Another method of going around this issue is that the action director may rely more on stylized action or filmmaking tricks. Examples include [Hong Kong action films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_action_films) such as the [*Police Story*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Story_(film_series)) franchise, [*Kung Fu Hustle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Hustle), [*Fearless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(2006_film)), [*Fist of Legend*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fist_of_Legend), [*Drunken Master*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_Master), [*Enter the Dragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Dragon), [*Shanghai Noon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Noon), [*Iron Monkey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Monkey_(1993_film)), [*Flash Point*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Point_(film)), and [*Shaolin Soccer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Soccer), as well as [*The Karate Kid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Karate_Kid_(1984_film)), [*A Force of One*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Force_of_One), [*Ninja Assassin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Assassin), [*Ong-Bak*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong-Bak:_Muay_Thai_Warrior), [*The Octagon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Octagon_(film)), [*Kill Bill*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Bill), [*Bloodsport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodsport_(film)), [*Lone Wolf McQuade*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_McQuade), [*Mortal Kombat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(1995_film)), [*Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1990_film)), [*The Raid: Redemption*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raid:_Redemption), [*Champion of Death*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_of_Death), [*Karate Bearfighter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_Bearfighter), [*Doberman Cop*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doberman_Cop), [*Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgo_13:_Assignment_Kowloon), [*Big Trouble in Little China*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China), [*Charlie's Angels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie%27s_Angels_(franchise)), and [*The Street Fighter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Street_Fighter) series.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film#cite_note-52)

My pick is when Keanu Reeves character meets Dracula in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). When I rewatch the movie, I always feel bad for Gary Oldman. His Dracula was really creepy and he had to deal with a completely wooden performance by Keanu Reeves and the worst English accent I have seen in a movie.

In the beginning I used to force him to watch movies with me hoping he would eventually love and we will watch more movies together but apart from watching harry Potter series and one two romantic movies(when Harry met Sally, four weddings and a funeral) he doesn't watch anything now. 

I don't force him anymore, if he doesn't want to why should I make an effort. But sometimes now and then I try to ask him, he says no straightway, which kinda makes me sad. 

I mean I love watching alone, like I watched zodiac, taxi driver, Ghostbusters afterlife, big sick, Lord of the rings, tenet, but sometimes I do get lonely. Watching those movies with someone, talking about them is a feeling I want to experience. 

I just wanted to share my feelings. It's fine if he didn't watch it, I will not say anything to him anymore about watching movies together.

I found it HORRIFICALLY SCARY. Like I couldn't even grasp the satirical aspect of it, it was just pure nightmarish horror. I watched the whole thing straight through, and it really felt like ""my first horror movie"". It didn't really affect my sleep per se, but the themes were adult enough that it was on my mind for like a week afterward. I just thought it was menacing and mean spirited, and the violence and imagery haunted my virgin 7 year old brain.

NOW... I just recently rewatched Gremlins for the first time since then (I'm 33 years old so its been about 25 years). and ya know what.... it isn't that scary. It's certainly dark and grotesque, but there's an element of ""kids movie"" to it. It's like a diet horror movie. And there's a very thick layer of humor/campiness and satire over it. It's still scary and dark, but I think maybe the datedness of the effects and the camera stylings and the editing make it less scary with age. It's just remarkable how much the human brain grows in that period to the point where abject horror could turn into nostalgia.

Anyway, I still enjoyed the movie. But one flaw I found is that they didnt develop the Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold characters. Especially the latter. He just felt phoned-in.

As for Gremlins 2... I also watched that in second grade and thought it was an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF CRAP. I thought it was cheesy, low-budget and had way crappier production aesthetics. I didn't get the jokes, and I thought it was like bland/diet gremlins. So... I also rewatched that this past week after 25 years and...I liked it quite a bit more than I had before. It's really a good piece of fun fluff. I now see how it is thumbing its nose at the genre. The second half of it was pretty good once it devolved into madness, and I enjoyed Hulk breaking the 4th wall, etc. Thats when it got good for me. The first half I thought was bland as sin. Anyway, I know everyone says G2 is the superior film but I disagree, its missing the ATMOSPHERE and SINISTER VIBES of the first one. The comedy of G2 is cute and all, but it just doesnt have the same gravitas.

In sum: Upon viewing each film 25 years later, I enjoyed G1 less and G2 more than I had before. Ultimately, G1 is the superior film

This is one of my all time favorite movies.  And given that the Ukraine is on most peoples brains, I thought I’d share.  

First it’s at least semi-autobiographical.  Based on the authors search for his Ukrainian Jewish roots.  It’s a quirky and beautifully shot film.  Superb acting and some uniquely hilarious moments and dialogue.  There is also sadness and history.  

It’s basically the story of a young Jewish man who travels to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandpa from the Nazis.  That’s all I really want to tell you.

If you do watch this movie.  Keep in mind the current story flying around of the old Ukrainians ladies giving Russian soldiers sunflower seeds.  There will be a sunflower scene in this movie.  And after hearing these stories, it made me think of this movie and the context of that scene.  There seems to be a historical basis for this idea.  It’s also what made me think to post this movie here.

t7g9td,The Dark Knight - Shakespearean Tragedy,Discussion,0,0.33,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t7g9td/the_dark_knight_shakespearean_tragedy/,0,"Shakespeare has so much influence even today in the modern art form called movies. A lot of movies can be identified if they fall into this by checking if they tick the below conditions.

The 10 characteristics of a Shakespearean Tragedy are

1. A tragic hero

Harvey Dent was supposed to be the knight in shining Armor and the poster boy for Gotham City in it's fight against crime but ends up becoming a killer towards the end.

2. A dichotomy of good and evil

Harvey Dent was a good person and his descent into his alter ego, Two-face due to his split personality disorder turns him evil. We don't even need joker and Batman as an example in this case.

3. A tragic waste

Gordon and Batman had high hopes on him at the beginning of the movie and in the end joker turns him to the dark side. It was a tragic waste even though they both managed to cover it up.

4. Hamartia (the hero’s tragic flaw)

Harvey was called two-face even when he was in internal affairs. He couldn't put the greater good of the city before his mission for revenge. Despite everyone idolizing him, he was a very flawed person.

5. Issues of fate or fortune

The fate and fortune always determines the outcome. In this case, it was losing Rachel that spiralled him into a cold blooded killer.

6. Greed

Harvey Dent wasn't a selfless person in the beginning, he was obsessed with becoming the Messiah figure of Gotham, he wanted to lock away every criminals and win everything.

7. Foul revenge

Harvey's final revenge was supposed to be Gordon's son which doesn't go as planned.

8. Supernatural elements

Let's just assume the joker is far from a normal human person as he executes every plan with inhumane perfection. And, Batman again is a symbol here.

9. Internal and external pressures

Joker's undue influence, his internal split personality disorder and the quest for revenge, everything can be regarded as pressures.

10. The paradox of life

In the end, it didn't even matter if he got his revenge, he threw it all away because of his misplaced priorities.

In this way, I believe The Dark Knight movie was more about Harvey Dent's fall than it was about Batman or Joker.

Obviously secondary marvel characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, Falcon would be wiped out immediately. 

Even main characters like Star Lord and Captain America would be no match in my opinion.

So far this is still relatively fresh but movie studios with multiple ip's are really going home with this.

Ten or twenty years ago it was epic set battles spurned by the success of lord of the rings. While the spectacle was novel at the beginning, it really started to get stale when EVERY movie had to have a big epic lord of the rings battle scene. (Alice in wonderland anyone??)

Often I feel like I've put in enough time that I feel compelled to finish it. And I can usually find the good in even the worse of movies. I love crappy horror movies. Movies like Hatchet, where you can almost pick out the profession actors from those who seem to be random people they found and asked to read the dialogue. Some low budget movies are great fun and you can forgive them their problems because you know they were doing the best with what they had.

However, recently I've seen a couple of horror movies that were so shockingly shite that I couldn't bring myself to finish watching them. ""Truth or Dare"" and ""Countdown"". Both had budgets in the millions. Both look great. Well shot, well directed... I guess. The actors were all fine. But the scripts... fuck me sideways they were a load of absolute wank. For each of them I watched about an hour and then just gave up. For both I ended up just reading the plot synopsis afterwards to check what I was ""missing"" and in neither case did I feel the need to go back to finish the movie.

&#x200B;

* **Terminator** \- The terminator is a sci-fi action  film by James Cameron,It gains positive review and was a box office hit ,its superior sequel Judgement day is renowned for its  unique special effects and storytelling and won numerous awards cementing Arnold Schwarzenegger as the popular movie star. The franchise should have stopped there, but Hollywood studios begins to milk the franchise and end up with sequels that didn't receive the same success the original and Judgement day received, like Rise of the machines,Salvation and Genisys as they receive mixed and negative reviews even the recent one Dark fate didn't help despite positive reception,Hollywood studios should have left the franchise alone after Judgement day since this is where the story ends. And they could have at least give it a hard reboot instead.
* **The Crow** \- A movie based on the comic book The crow was an dark superhero film starring Brandon Lee,It was supposed to be his breakout role but sadly because of an accident gunshot during rehearsal Brandon died, but despite the tragedy the film has become a success and a cult classic which spawned sequels but never receive the  success the original did,There was going  to be a reboot directed by Corin Hardy and starring  Jason Momoa  in the lead role but because of Production delays and numerous problems the film was scrapped and Momoa and Hardy left the project, but recently the producer of the reboot is about to revive it again this time with a new director,actors and crew though I think it's better that Hollywood should leave the franchise alone as it might be cursed 
* **Highlander**\- A cult classic film about immortals battling each other to claim the 'prize' ,Despite that it gain mixed reviews ,It becomes a box office hit and a cult classic,  especially its unique soundtrack by the Queens. However, recent sequels receive negative reviews and didn't gain success like the original. And there's going to be a reboot starring Henry Cavil and if it's greenlit, it will probably be terrible , and I think as the quote of the original goes ""*There can be only one*."" 
* **Predator** \- This is a science fiction horror action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger ,It receives mixed reviews and became box office hits and spawned recent sequels that didn't became huge box office hits. And now,  there is a prequel that is about to be released on Hulu. 
* **The Amityville horrors** \- This horror movie from 1979 was based on a novel based on a true crime case involving a family and a supernatural haunted house and it gained negative reviews, Despite that ,It gained a cult following and spawned numerous sequels ever since. Hollywood should have just given up on the critically panned franchise and leave it abandoned,forever. 
* **Texas chainsaw massacre**\- A horror film from 1974 which is considered controversial  and groundbreaking because of its realism and violent scary content ,However recent sequels and reboots didn't receive the same success the original received even the recent 2022 film released by Netflix failed to capture the spirit of the original ,Hollywood should have just given up with the franchise for many years. 
* **Jaws** \- The 1975 thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg is known for its  death defying  scenes and suspense that it  earned a top spot in pop culture including its sequel Jaws 2 which has a unique tagline ""*Just when you thought it was safe  to go back in the water...*"" However, the third film Jaws 3 (a.k.a. Jaws 3-D) didn't receive the same success the original two films received despite being  a box office hit, and the fourth one, Jaws the revenge is considered the worst film ever made and this is when Hollywood decided to never make another Jaws film ever again.Especially that Spielberg who directed the  first movie prevent them, which is why this is the only franchise that Hollywood has given up on. 
* **Home Alone** \-The last one in the list is the 1990 comedy family film Home Alone,where a kid has to defend his home by himself from two  burglars,It gains positive reviews , a box office hit and is considered a Christmas holiday classic. A sequel in 1992 has also become a box office hit in 1992 despite mixed reviews ,However recent sequels starting from Home alone 3 did not receive the similar success the original film received including the recent one released on Disney+ called Home Sweet Home Alone which is critically panned.

I do not remember a lot about it except for the ending. All I really remember is that a couple, who were both demons, had come to the human realm to birth a child. I do not know why. However, the demons fell in love with their child, wanting to protect it and love it and raise it. Some evil force came to them and tried to either kill or banish them but an angel or God intervened and stopped the evil force and saved the couple and the child, allowing them to live a normal human life with their child.

For context, I’m an American Born Indian. I grew up with Bollywood movies and musicals but stopped when I just didn’t have the time to be watching movies that much anymore. Lately, I’ve been getting into movies; joining this subreddit, meeting people on letterboxd, etc; and I started watching some Bollywood movies that I always wanted to see when I was little but my parents said I couldn’t watch at that age.  I essentially forgot how these movies were like. 

Going from Hollywood cinema to Bollywood is such a big change. You never get these elegant spaces all rented out so the lead actor and their love interest can swoon for each other in an empty banquet hall. You never get a hundred people all dancing to some crazy choreo in PRACTICAL shots! West Side Story was amazing but so much of it was CGI and green screen, so seeing all that effort in broad daylight is insane. 

The drone shots, the overhead shots, how often they show the beauties of India. It’s so well documented. 

And these movies are all one offs! They condense in what Hollywood would expand into a trilogy consisting of 2 hours each into a 3 hour movie that combines 2-3 stories into one big movie, while arguably building on the characters so well. 

I truly think we take these movies for granted. It’s easy for non-Indians to dismiss movies from other countries. And it’s also easy for Indians to dismiss how much work was put into these movies, my mom’s completely unfazed it’s as if she’s watching a CW show or a sitcom, something that she can just turn on for noise. 

We need to show Bollywood movies so much more love. (Plus the music is banger too)",1646441208.0

It’s soooo dumb! But it’s suppose to be smart, right? That’s what irks me, it’s one of the movies where they don’t want us to question any of the absolutely idiotic things going on in the plot like they are totally normal things that characters would do. And before anyone says “ugh nobody can enjoy movies anymore” or “don’t take it so seriously”…just no. I like dumb  and fun movies just fine. This was insultingly dumb. 

The opening scene with the aliens first invading was pretty dope. Wish there was more of that. But wait, didn’t the first movie say the aliens landed in Mexico or something? Instead they are now crash landing in their space ships (?) in main characters backyard in rural America. Gotcha. Main character immediately realizes that aliens are attracted to sound, that’s pretty cool. Why military so useless when this information so easily obtained? The aliens don’t seem to be some zerg based swarm of creatures since whenever a character makes a noise deemed loud enough by the plot (opening doors and squeaky hatches is fine) only one shows up. 

Why are these people barefoot walking on rocks? Is it much quieter to walk barefoot? Well, the plots tells us apparently not, since Emily blunts husbands friend that we are introduced to is wearing the god damn heaviest boots I have ever seen. So that was dumb. 

And okay so the people on the island are playing a song on repeat as some sort of a SECRET RIDDLE? Why tf don’t they just play a  recording of a message that says, “hey, come to this island where there is shelter at this location we are safe because the aliens can’t swim”. Wait what!? The aliens can’t fcking SWIM!? So like what’s going on at any of the island nations of the world? Australia just chillin? Not only can’t they swim but they look like they die almost instantly in water, flailing around like a giraffe in a bathtub. So a year after alien invasion, where are the damn battleships around every coast of the country, why aren’t they broadcasting messages everywhere, dropping notes from planes telling people where to go. Are we expected to honestly believe they abandoned the entire country? Don’t we control the skies? These aliens ain’t flying planes. They’re obviously dumb as shit since one of them dives into the water thinking it’s a seal. 

And then we get to the boat harbor zombie (?)  “other people in apocalypse movie bad scene” which was foreshadowed so dumbly by Emily blunts husbands friend. I get it, these people are waiting by the boats to kidnap and possibly eat travelers. But why do they look like zombies? It’s only been a year. And when the aliens came, why didn’t they jump in the water? Guess they missed the message that aliens can’t swim. Also there was like 15 fully functional boats. That one guy explained how once boats proved to be op people started hollering and stampeding toward them the aliens showed up and killed everyone. I don’t buy it. Was this a coordinated attack across the country? Doesn’t seem like it since these aliens have shown no motive or means of attacking earth but the hatred of sound (but apparently not from loud flocks of crows;so dumb). If rural America is under attack, that means the coast people around the world have plenty of time to get to their boats. Which brings me to the previous point, where the hell are the military. 

Oh, I missed the part when Emily blunt leaves to get medicine the teenage boy puts the baby in a coffin and WONDERS AROUND AIMLESSLY, obviously luring in an alien. He couldn’t wait?! What was he gonna do? See if he could spot Emily blunt approaching with his binos and then do nothing? Dumb.

They get to the island and the people are chillin. That’s cool. So we went on this quest to deliver this weapon to help save the world, why are we dilly daddling? Get on with it. Oh snap, alien shows up. What do people do? IMMEDIATELY START RUNNING AND SCREAMING? Like what, you are a survivor colony and you do that one thing that you know you’re not suppose to do. So half of them die in like 3 minutes. 

Ps, why don’t they throw rocks or any other objects to trick the aliens away from them? I’m probably forgetting some dumb things. This movie insulted my intelligence, which is hard to do since I’m fairly dumb already. 

Okay I guess rant over, it’s been fun. 2/10. Great acting and beautifully shot movie though. Just soooooo dumb and utterly pointless movie that didn’t need a sequel. Cash grabbing nonsense.",1646459975.0

I remember playing it first with my uncle (who has since passed away).  It was a nice bonding time for us and I have since played the HD remake a bunch when it came out.

I enjoyed a lot of the other games too, but the first is always best for me.

With regards to the movies, The first 2 are ok movies (The  Paul Anderson  ones) although honestly they have little to nothing to do with the games beyond just the title, but as the movies went on they just got....well worse and worse.  They just went from being ok movies to horrible b-roll type movies.  The last one is still the only movie I ever left early and asked the theatre for my money back lol.

When I saw the pictures for Welcome to Racoon city that were released my thoughts were that they honestly felt like a bunch of college kids cosplaying in some random boiler room.  Then I saw some trailers, and I thought...I will give it a shot. Well I finally ended up watching it.

They looked good and honestly had similar personalities to those that I remember from the games.   (I don't recall Claire having this deep hatred for Umbrella.....her story was she was just trying to find her brother...but I may just not remember it from the games.

\-Neal McDonough is great in pretty much whatever.  So....was happy to see him there.

\*\*\*Cons\*\*\*

\-Every other Character not named above.

\-First...Richard Aiken was Bravo team no Alpha.  Why they used him and not Barry or Joseph I have no idea.  Certainly given how quickly he goes out they could have used the same actor and just named him Joseph Frost and they would have been true to source.

\-Probably the biggest miss, Albert Wesker.  This guy (from the game) was cool, calm, ice in his veins.  Nothing shook him.  He was the leader of STARS Alpha team and the movie plays him off as someone who is goofing off and honestly just not all that......well...watch to see but he seems just meh.  AND...(and this I will admit is just being nitpicky....but still) his hair.  Wesker is always portrayed as having blond hair that is slicked back.  Would that have been too hard??  Also they just...kinda omitted the entire ""He was working for Umbrella"" part which made the betrayal just...meh.  And his death.....was soo...just....bad.  Gets shot by Jill thats it.  (More on this below).

\-Jill Valentine - meh.  I don't recall her being so....aggressive in the original game.  She always seemed calculating, like, she could take care of herself, but didn't seem as assertive as Chris was in the games.  So at the beginning when she is throwing stuff at leon and taking food.....I dont know.  Just didn't feel like the Jill from the games.  (The Jill from the previous movies didn't either thou lol)

\-Leon Kennedy - If Wesker was the worse character screw up...this one has to be a very close second place.  Leon was a rookie cop....and that is about all they got right.  Why he seemed so.....incapable through the entire movie (Even going as far as not knowing how to load a shotgun).  In the games he felt like he could hold his own and helped Claire as much as she helped him.  In this movie he felt more like a damsel in distress the whole time.

\-Trying to fit two games worth of story into one movie.  I think Hollywood has shown that converting a game to a movie is NOT easy.  There have been only a few GOOD adaptations.  The first Mortal Kombat comes to mind, but there are by FAR more horrible ones.  So why you would choose to combine two games is just beyond me.  Which leads to my next one....

\-Pacing-  Because there were two stories to go through, neither location (Mansion or the Police Station) really gets any focus.  The locations were almost a character of their own in the games, the police station is hardly even in the movie.  The Mansion is, but you really only get maybe 20 minutes...if that.  And really the ""fan service"" moments from the above pro section, you get the opening room with the staircase and then you get the piano room.  Other than that, there are a few hallway shots and one very dark scene that I believe is supposed to be the dining room and that's it.

\-No Tyrant - That moment in the games where the Tyrant kills Wesker was HUGE...was awesome, but due to having two games in one movie they elected to go with Birkin and the G-Virus instead of Tyrant....which...just meh.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I had the realization that he wasn't going to be in the movie. It would be like making the third story and leaving out Nemesis.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - It's better than the other  Paul Anderson movies, but not by much.  Feels like the set designers had played the games but the writers/director did not.",1646411969.0

For me I cannot believe that there has not been a new version of a D&D (Dngeons & Dragons) movie! With how successful LOTR was and Game of Thrones as well it amazes me that they have never been able to make an actual good D&D movie! There is decades of content to pull from, decades of stories, rich well developed characters and worlds to choose from as well one of the largest fan bases of any game/franchise there is! Plus D&D has had a huge resurgence of popularity among actors in the media with tons of them taking every opportunity to talk about how they played D&D as a kid and that they continue to play it as an adult.

Hitman: He's getting his mob together tomorrow night. Whisky Nick's.

2: Trimagasi in The Platform

My favorite scene (spoilers)

Goreng: I brought a book. Don Quixote. What did you bring?

Trimagasi: Obvio. El Samurai Plus.


3: Anton Chigurh in No Country For Old Men (yes I'm a big fan of the Coens)

Carson Wells: You don't have to do this. I could make it worth your while. Take you to an ATM with 14 grand in it. Everyone just walks away.

Anton Chigurh: An ATM

Later

Anton: People always say the same thing.

Carla Jean: What do they say?

Anton: They say ""You don't have to do this.""

4: Sergeant Zim (""actually that's Private now"") in Starship Troopers (one could argue this falls into the action category but meh)

Ace: I don't understand. Who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway? All you have to do is push a button.

Zim grabs a knife: Put your hand on that wall, trooper.

So, the Major challenges the accent of the british officer. That being said, Von Hammersmarck vouches for him, he provides a good enough story about the skiing torch scene, and he sits down and they play the card game.

it's arguable, that Hellstrom only fully realised they werent German, with the three finger action for the glasses (even if he suspected they were enemies all the way through). Even if he suspected it, this was his confirmation that they were the enemy. 

However, at this point, he'd already agreed with them that he was intruding and had agreed to leave. That's why he asked eric for the best scotch, before he left them to it. He even glares at Hicox when he shows the three fingers, which confirms to him they are agents.

But then, for a totally stupid and pointless reason, he then calls him out and admitted Hixcox had ""given himself away"".

Even if he knew this, why didn't he just go along with it, drink the scotch, apologise for intruding and leave before getting reinforcements. 

His only assistance could come from the other table, who are all drunk and can't see whats going on. He's surrounded by 4 enemy agents, yet he decides to confirm to them that he knows they are enemy, by revealing he has his gun pointed at Hicox under the table. 

Even if he was worried about being ambused outside by Aldo (who he didnt even know was there), he would have been better returning to his booth before preparing his pistol and then challenging them with some actual cover, rather than when he's sat down and surrounded by 4 of them. 

I just feel like the writing at this point could have been better, because it makes zero sense for the Major to reveal he knows they are agents. He's clearly an intelligent character, shown in the way he deals with Shoshanna in front of Goebbels earlier on, so for him to suddenly call out Hicox and the others makes no sense, when he at last had a chance to get up and leave, keeping up the appearance that he bought their story.

Was it enjoyable, or did the lack of context make it confusing for you?

I watched Alien 3 before the first two (back in the early 90s before Alien was such an archetype in our media), and I found it way less impactful simply because the Alien was not as scary. I think a gripe that many miss with that film is that it relies on shorthand experience from the previous two films to actually make the Alien scary. If you didn't see everything that the Alien was capable of, they didn't show you a reason to be scared, and you were just kind of like ""okay, this dog thing must be deadly, oh look, it is killing a dude I think."" 

Separately, I also saw Terminator 2 before Terminator, and Cameron did a great job making it a self-contained film. The T1000 is an eerie/creepy villain without seeing the first film. 

Finally, I also saw Predator 2 before Predator 1, and I actually think the experience was better because the Predator is scary as fuck and seems more unstoppable without seeing how Arnie took it down in Predator 1, Predator 1 is a way better movie, but it is almost a scarier series if you watch the second one first.",1646414486.0

We have the Lionsgate film (people making fun of it for the cheap animation and bad voice acting), we have the Disney+ film, and then we have the Gullimero Del Toro film on Netflix.






What’s funny is that each film is drastically different from each other. We have the Lionsgate film being fully animated, we have the Disney+ film that is fully live action, and then we have the Gullimero Del Toro film which is stop motion animation. 







The film I’m looking forward to the most would be Gullimero Del Toro’s project. He’s been working on this for years and years, I have a feeling the stop motion animation will be something beautiful (especially when we haven’t had any yet), and then it’s also a twist to the Pinocchio story as well. I have a feeling this is going to be the next Squid Game or Endgame where everyone and their mom is talking about it.

I can't help but roll my eyes every time I see somebody list Scary Movie in the two unfunny hacks' filmography. I've seen people list Scary Movie with Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc., but omit the sequels on the basis of ""they weren't really involved with those"", though SM1 gets inclusion based on the fact that they're ""2 of the 6 writers"". I've even seen people use their (farced, I'll get to that in a sec) Scary Movie ""credits"" in their favor, saying ""they're not *completely* awful (or at least not the worst), they made Scary Movie!"" Fact is, **they didn't actually write Scary Movie 1, either.** [The Wayanses October 12, 2012 podcast (The Champs) has the whole story at 1:09:00.](https://allthingscomedy.com/podcast/the-champs/shawn-marlon-wayans/page/4)

Basically, they told one of their PR managers they were making a spoof of Scream, at the time titled  *Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell On Friday The 13th*. 3 months later, that manager left the company and gave their idea to Seltzberg. Desperate to get a spoof project made after selling 40 unproduced scripts (*gee, I wonder why*), they then quickly rushed out a Scream spoof of their own. It even had a similar (working?) title to the one written by the Wayans Bros. (somehow, I don't think that's any coincidence), *Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween.* Not wanting competition from a similar movie, the Weinsteins bought the script from them.

Then when production began on what would become Scary Movie, these two hacks claim the Wayanses ripped off *their* idea (that they only knew about from a tip from their ex-PR manager) and the WGA forced them to include them in the credits. They were then able to market every single movie they've made on the backs of ""from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie"".

So yeah, if you've ever wondered why *every single one* of their movies after Scary Movie was such a massive letdown from Scary Movie (I don't know if that says more about them or SM1 tbh), **it's because they never did Scary Movie.** These two hacks have never made anything close to a decent film ever. Their whole rise to fame was they stole one from the Wayanses and the WGA forced them to credit the two on a movie they had 0 involvement with. That's literally the only reason they're even listed in the credits of that movie. Even the [IMDb Trivia page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175142/trivia?item=tr3451168) says nothing from their script was used because Keenen Ivory Wayans (the director) read it and said it was steaming hot garbage-**just like every other movie they made!**",1646273607.0

Finally checked it out last night and I enjoyed but feel similar to him when it comes to the ending. He’s basically said that he feels like he didn’t get the last act right.

I feel like there are two concepts that I would have been okay with: either CRS is actually a scheme to get rich people’s money and drain them and the only way to get out of it is to recruit someone else (the way Sean Penn did in the beginning) or he actually does shoot his brother while he tried to surprise him. After the brother gets shot it gets way too over the top and you start looking back and saying: “wait, really?”. If my friends and family basically pranked me so hard that drove me to suicide, know damn well I wouldn’t be all cheery about it.

And yes, I’ve read the many essays on this film arguing for the ending and how it was necessary for him to go through all of that but, he actually didn’t? Also, I understand that with a movie like this one you suspend disbelief but when he talks to the private investigator and fires his gun, are we supposed to think that was a trick too?

I have scoured this sub looking for somebody to call Jackman's character out and I have seen people condemn him in the comments or as a footnote in the post, but nobody is coming right out and saying it.

His character's choices are 100% immoral and the point of the movie is definitely to show that, while police work is slow and often does not yield the deserved justice, vigilantism is an extremely slippery slope. Jackman thought without a question of a doubt that he had the right guy, but he didn't. Even if he did, the torture tactics are beyond what any rational human should be okay with.

I have seen countless people on this sub say that he was justified even going as far as to say that Dano should have confessed (completely missing that Dano genuinely didn't know what happened to the girls or have the capability to share that). People are projecting this dark fantasy to make pedophiles violently pay for their crimes that they're making up Dano's character's involvement in the crime to justify Jackman's actions that represent this violent fantasy they have of torturing a pedophile.

Stumbling onto Dano ends up leading to Gyllenhaal saving the day, but some viewers seem to think this makes Jackman's actions okay since it plays a part in his daughter being saved. The movie is so nuanced and the open-ended conclusion seems to be to let the viewer decide if Jackman deserved his fate or not. Hate his guts? He dies buried alive. He doesn't? He gets rescued. Regardless of which ending, Jackman is punished for his crime which is the fitting ending.",1646422807.0

t5z0d3,Soapbox: Tremors 2 is one of my favorite sequels,Recommendation,2,0.54,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t5z0d3/soapbox_tremors_2_is_one_of_my_favorite_sequels/,11,"This is a weird one, but I stand by it lol.

Tremors is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a classic monster movie with great acting, scripting, special effects, and comedy. It deserve to be placed alongside other horror comedy classics as one of the greats...I love it.

That being said, I think I like its sequel just as much.

Tremors 2, imo, is a criminally underrated film. It has so much going for it but gets almost no recognition from any film enthusiasts, at least that I can find. A search for it on youtube barley comes up with any meaningful coverage of it as a film; just clips and behind the scenes footage.

The premise is creative and a great follow-up to the first film. Instead of making a desperate stand against the Graboids as everyone gets picked off, the heroes are on a mission to specifically hunt down/exterminate them after another community has started suffering the same fate as Perfection did in the first one. It's great to see our protagonists on the upper hand against the monsters for the first half of the film, and really allows the twist, that the Graboids have evolved into a new form more agile above ground form, to carry a lot of impact. And the conclusion is just as exciting and bombastic as the first one.

I think it excels because of just how tight and well written the script is. There is so much set up and payoff layered through the whole thing. Characters have legitimate and relatable motivation as to why they are putting themselves into the situation they're in. No time is wasted in progressing the plot; it's brisk movie. And that is helped by the comedy. IDK if I'd say it's as funny as the first one...it may be. But there are so many great jokes in this movie. My favorite, is from Burt, the gun nut doomsday prepper, realizing he is completely unprepared for the situation he's found himself in. He just has this exasperation that is so well conveyed; his performance is golden here. 

Actually, that can be said of all the performances...most if not all these actors are unknowns, but they give really strong performances. The range they have to show, going from abject terror to their great comedic timing just really elevates everything even higher than where it already was. IDK how Fred Ward isn't a more well known name, because he is just a wonderful actor. (Sidenote, looked him up and he started his career off in Italy as a mime...fun stuff haha)

And this movie is legitimately creepy...I wouldn't say it's a terrifying film or anything, but it does a fantastic job of just building this eerie atmosphere of isolation, even more so than the first one. There is this one sequence in particular, all at night, in the pitch black, no one around except our heroes, out in the middle of nowhere. It really captures the anxiety of being stuck in a horrible situation with no recourse, especially knowing there are little man eating monsters running around trying to gobble our characters up. 

Rounding the whole thing out are the effects...now this was made near the birthing of CGI as an industry tool, so there is some CG, and it does look mostly bad...but because it was so early, the CG is minimal...most of the effects are all still practical, and they look basically just as good as the first movie...which is amazing cause this one had like a 12mil dollar budget. The monsters, explosion effects, set design...everything just looks so good for such a low budget movie. The new creatures in particular are inventive, fun, and most importantly scary.

I don't know why this movie didn't get a theatrical release, at least in the US. Tremors wasn't a huge hit, but it made money, and this was a worthy successor to it. From what I can tell, when the studio realized that Kevin Bacon wasn't returning, they pulled a ton of funding out of the production and just stopped caring about it. A lot of the team came onto this one at severly cut rates, if not pro-bono because they were so determined to get it made! Such a cool story. 

All in all, this movie deserves A LOT more credit...its such a good film, a wonderful sequel, and it is criminally underrated....if not just under viewed entirely. I will stand by this 'til the end of my days damnit! I highly recommend checking this one out...and if you haven't seen the first one, watch that one before hand. As a duo of movies, they are just so fun and deserve all the love in the world! The remaining sequels range from fun schlock to absolute garbage, basically in order of their release. But don't let the current state of the franchise turn you off the second one...it's a gem.

Also, just want to add, they were going to make a Kevin Bacon lead Tremors revival TV series a few years back that legit looked really good...then they cancelled it. Still salty about that one lol. Trailer is on youtube for it, check it out",1646334275.0

It's set in winter, maybe late 80s-early 90s time period. I recorded it around 2007-2009. It's about a teenager who was homeschooled but begins public school. He makes this relationship with one of his teachers and convinces the teacher to let the kids read Shakespeare instead of some book about snowboarding. The family has a sauna at home and they have parties where the teenager gives his mom's friends massages. The teacher is gay and has hook ups in some random public bathroom, the kid finds out and tries to sleep with his teacher but the teacher turns him down. The mom was cheating on her husband with a neighbour. 

I know it's not much to go on but none of my Googling has given me any answers.

t5vhp2,Episodic sequels vs Serialised sequels,Discussion,0,0.5,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/t5vhp2/episodic_sequels_vs_serialised_sequels/,3,"So in general I think there are usually two types of sequels that are made after the original movie is successful enough to warrant another part. 

The first is the episodic one where even though the characters or the setting or the premise will be same, the movie can be watched as a standalone piece of work and doesn't need the viewer to have necessarily watched the original movie. I am thinking of something like the Indiana Jones orignal trilogy or Die Hard 2. Sure the viewer might miss a few references or jokes here and there, but they could still fundamentally enjoy the movie, appreciate the majority of it without needing to see the original one.

The Serialised sequel on the other hand is highly dependent on the viewer having watched the previous part. The plotlines and the character arcs directly continue from the previous part and a viewer trying to watch a Serialised sequel will most likely be quite lost and would unlikely be able to enjoy the movie that much. I am thinking of something like The Godfather trilogy, the original Star Wars trilogy or the Lord of The Rings trilogy. 

The reason I am fascinated between these two types of sequels is because of what it says about movies as a medium. Conventional wisdom about film has been that it must exist as an island, as its own individual piece of storytelling which isn't reliant on further or previous parts to be able to work. Indeed i think the reason why franchise movies have seemed so tiring is because it feels that instead of a movie being a one and a done thing, we always will have more and more of sequels/ spinoffs etc. this ensuring that the story will never end and the characters we have been following will never reach the end of their arcs. 

Episodic sequels are able to get around some of those complaints since those could exist as islands of their own without being reliant much on other parts. Yet by being episodic, there is also a contradiction of the characters never being allowed to have a permanent change and having to revert back to status quo in order to ensure that another movie can be made.

Serialised sequels obviously face the problem that they can't exist as islands. You can't watch The Godfather Part 2 or Empire Strikes Back or Return of the King as standalone piece of art because a lot of their power is derived from following up on the original parts. But they also allow for a more permanent shift in characters arcs and conclusions to plot lines than episodic sequels. It is also why when an attempt is made to continue further their storylines like Godfather Part 3 or the sequel Trilogy there is a further backlash from critics and fans because they feel that Godfather Part 2 or Return of the Jedi had provided ample closure to the story and there wasn't any need to return to this world or these characters.

One further thing that needs to be acknowledged in regards to this conversation is MCU movies since they technically allow for both episodic sequels and serialised sequels. I do think that the mix and matching of both these types of sequels have been one of the reasons why the franchise has been so successful in the 2010s although with more of them being made, it will undoubtedly become harder and harder to keep up with the Serialised sequels. MCU needs both of these sequels and either of them decreasing in quantity will create long terms problems for it.",1646325128.0

Okay to be serious for a second, I re-watched JURASSIC PARK yesterday and found myself in awe at how perfect the opening is. The first four scenes expertly set up the film's story and characters, with payoffs that will obviously come later on. I know this isn't shocking for a film to do, nor is it that JP did it in some special way, but it's just such expert storytelling: 

**Scene 1: The Raptor Attacks**
- I love that Spielberg, Koepp, and Crichton pretty much say that everything about Jurassic Park is a bad idea with this scene. Everything is tense, everyone is on high alert, as a velociraptor is teased, not totally shown. Immediately we're wary about what's happening here, and sure enough, someone is killed by the raptor, setting the stage for the dinos to wreak havoc later on. 

**Scene 2: The Lawyer Arrives** 
- I love how immediately following the dino attack, we're not introduced to anyone related to the victim, but a lawyer sent on behalf of Jurassic Park's investors to investigate the safety of the park. However, it's obvious that he doesn't care about park safety, nor those who are coming to the park. He only cares about the money. While he says he's there for safety concerns, his face says another story, as he stares in awe of the amber that was just discovered. Immediately you know, this guy is not only bad news, but he won't be the one to shut this place down due to safety hazards. 

**Scene 3: Alan and Ellie**
- What a perfect sequence. The intro to Alan and Ellie is done perfectly, showcasing that they're not in this job for the money, but because they clearly have love and passion for dinosaurs. I love that you instantly recognize that Alan is the hard one and Ellie is the softer one. Everything about Alan is shown in two moments: the way he compares dinos to birds and reptiles, who also schooling a kid on raptors (showcasing his dislike for them), perfectly setting up the final battle against the raptors and how he grows to care for Tim and Lex... PURE C I N E M A!

Also love Hammond's introduction, as the ""spare no expense"" philosophy is on full display. Hammond flies himself out to recruit Alan and Elie, showing his naivety by landing so close to the fossil (not even realizing the damage he could've done), but immediately comes across as warm and caring in his interaction with Alan and Elie. Right away, it's clear that not only does this guy not think that far ahead, but you'll still root for him, as he genuinely cares for his inventions, dinos, and park-goers. 

**Scene 4: Nedry and Dodgson**
- The only time where exposition is necessary, yet it's done in a playful way that you never feel you're being talked at. The final scene sets up our villain, Dennis Nedry, who's clearly been treated unfairly by Hammond. Simple and effective, Nedry is shown to be a weasel who can be bought easily. This scene does the most in terms of setting up the plot, but again, it never feels like you're just being told something. Nedry works in his grievences with Hammond while Dodgson is explaining his tool to help Nedry steel the embryos. Great writing here. 

All in all, like I said, nothing about this opening is groundbreaking. I just love how Crichton, and eventually Dave Koepp, sets up everything about this movie in 4 scenes that span something like 10 minutes. Everything you need to know about what will happen in JURASSIC PARK is shown. One of the many, many reasons why i consider JP to be my favourite movie of all time.",1646236245.0

Edit: [https://web.archive.org/web/20220224052105/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/](https://web.archive.org/web/20220224052105/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/)

Here, I can see two Tarkovsky movies. It's from 24/02/2022. Come and see is still on the list. It's just Tarkovsky I guess?",1646317366.0

A lot of Marvel movies are longer than 2 hours, the Transformers movies are incredibly long. Same goes for films like Batman v. Superman, Fast & Furious, the Nolan Batman movies and most new Blockbusters. I blame the LOTR trilogy for going that long. Obviously a good movie can make you forget the lenght of the movie, I just wish a lot of Blockbusters would keep it tighter and save pacing issues.",1646269864.0

I was struck by how much of a descendant I feel *Boonme* is of *Tokyo Story*. I knew about Ozu and enjoy contemplative and slow/beautiful films (*Three Times, Another Year, Winter's Sleep -* etc) I just have to work myself up to  the mood, because I'm also perfectly happy to see the new Spiderman, or any ole' sci fi flick at all.  But I feel such a strong relationship between these two. I am wondering if anyone else does.

Each approaches the fundamental question of parting and takes a very unaffected and modest approach to its lead characters speaking about the possibility of time and nature and the reality of their life where they are.

Anyhow, if you're a keen fan of either of these and haven't seen the other, let me encourage you!

Specifically, it hit me when:

**SPOILERS**

...by the time we get to the Buddhist funeral in *Tokyo Story* I though of how fluidly some of the reflections in *Boonme* would fit seamlessly over, really, any scene here. And how much the final sequence with similar Buddhist imagery matched with quiet, unaffected scene-setting seems to pair.

after reading this it makes me realize that mainstream live action  Hollywood is truly full of shit for the next couple of years or worse another decade from now. 

Honestly I feel bad for veteran and most importantly up and coming writers, producers, and directors. Seeing a major studio like Fox get embarrassingly fucked over is heartbreaking. It's a big fuck you to anyone who cared about or works in the Hollywood movie industry and making a wide variety of movies and treating them equally.

But at this point I feel like this is where Steamers (Netflix, Amazon, and soon to be Appletv+) and indie distributors (A24, Bleeker Street, Neon and sometimes IFC and Magnoila) are going to come in. I feel like in the next couple of years this is where they are going to reach a peak as far as filmmaking and creativity goes. More movies that are riskier, different, or alternative are going to those companies and are probably going to better than most major studio films in the next couple of years.

I honestly can't wait to see what the streamers and indies have to offer. Sure not all of them are going to be winners and some might be just filler crap. But hey at least they made something that you know won't get greenlight at a major like Warner Bros. or Sony because whoever runs them are washed up pussies and think audiences are stupid and greenlight whatever unwanted remake, rehashed IP or CGI effect nonsense.

Anyone who decides to direct a movie for Live action Disney and the lobotomized version of 20th Century Fox from now on are honestly fucking sellouts to me who just needs a quick fat paycheck.",1646367511.0

Most times when we watch the film, we end up muting it or fast forwarding through the song. The other day she suggested that I replace the song with The Police's song *Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic*, which would change the feel of scenes, something more upbeat and less dreary. I jumped into Adobde Premiere and made it happen. Here are the results!

And they take hundreds of millions of years to collide, right? Well, what if for half the year, they all collide to be a super continent. Then the other half, they all go back to normal. I'm not an expert on things like this, but the continents could split to become part of another, creating tension between the countries from pieces breaking off.

I mean, imagine something like the Mongolian Empire at its peak, 9 million square miles. But then, it starts to break apart as the years go on, into other countries.

I would really like to see where this goes. I would like to see how society has adapted to this, with earthquakes very often. Each country could prepare for the 6 months, for their 1 opening to the rest of the world each year.

How would you guys like to see this? I know I would.

* Interstellar (2014)
* ~~Titanic (1997)~~
* Gravity (2013)
* Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)

So near the beginning of the movie, Oto is caught cheating but it never shows the man’s face… for half of the movie, I assumed that man was Takatsuki since he was (I think) seen with her before this occurred in the film and it reinforced the thought that it was probably Takatsuki that Oto cheated with

Then this was even further reinforced when Takatsuki sticks out among the participants but it also could just be because he simply worked with Oto of course. But then, Takatsuki is always causing trouble and things that Kafuku says to him seem to imply that he’s talking about his wild behavior that led to him cheating?? Like when they’re at the bar, Kafuku seems visibly irritated with him most of the time as if he holds a grudge against him.

also I’m kind of confused why he seemed unaffected by when the police got to the theater and he just went with them like it’s nothing even though he’s going to be in jail for a very long time

So I guess his character as a whole stumped me a bit",1646319914.0
