Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it

They push divisions and anti government rhetoric, and have become a significant threat to the existing power structure. 

Now imagine the response of these groups globally if our governments decided that their actions constitute a threat and fall under terrorism laws and acted accordingly. Perhaps the Gov arrests people in these groups, invades and shuts down churches and psuedo religious groups that push these ideas, cracks down on militias, arrests or expels the politicians that support them ect.

spo5yv,hwgflew,t3_spo5yv,"I have an unvaccinated brother that moved back to my parents after a fight with his girlfriend.  This is a problem, obviously, but especially so because we have a baby popping out soon.  Him being there means I can no longer have them come over and meet the baby or help in any way.  So I say if you want to come over, the brother has to move back to his girlfriends for three weeks since they have made up and are still together.

No big deal, right?  He makes plenty of money, and he was only back home temporarily to find a new place.  All  I am asking is instead of being there, he takes his laptop and sleeps next to a beautiful woman willing to touch his bathing suit area for three weeks.

All to keep a helpless newborn baby safe.

Mom agrees and she tells me it's all taken care of.  No problems at all.  Then dad calls and informs me she's full of shit, he hasn't left at all, and does not plan to.

I confront her over the phone for lying and literally putting a newborn at risk of death rather than inconvenience my brother for three weeks at his girlfriend's place.  She says I'm forcing her to choose between her two sons (we don't get along considering his shitty selfish behavior like being an anti-vaxxer).  She says she won't ""kick him out on the street"".

I point out the ""street"" here is a very pretty woman's bed.

She doesn't care, she won't do it and I am selfish for demanding that my newborn not be around the unvaxxed during a pandemic, and she is justified for lying.  She is only sorry she got caught.

To say I blew up on her would be a severe understatement.  It was the hardest I've ever dug into another person in my entire life.  My voice has been sore for three days.  I regret nothing.

One day I was on the internet and some website required me to enter an email to see whatever it was that I was looking at. I didn’t want to put in my email address, and it dawned on me that I should put in (let’s call him Todd) Todd’s work email address instead of my own. I got a giggle assuming he’d get an email or two from this particular website. Then it dawned on me that I should use his email for EVERYTHING. So I did just that. Anywhere there was an input for an email I put his work email address. Hell, even a pen-and-paper newsletter signup sheet at a coffee shop. Boom, down went his work email. For weeks I did this. Anywhere and everywhere. Eventually I slowed down and it kind of waned until it slipped out of my mind. 
A year or two went by and one day Todd and I are busy doing our day to day things, very normal day. He pipes up over the cubicle wall asking if I ever get emails that start with “[advertisement]” in the subject line. I said, “maybe once or twice a year, why?” And he goes “god I get all these emails…like this one about refurbished printers” something about refurbished printers set off a flag in my brain… “oh my god,” I thought “that was me!!!” Doing my best to keep a straight face, I asked him how many of these emails did he get a day. EIGHTY OR NINETY. EVERY DAY. I could hear the frustration in his voice as he would click through his inbox and delete delete delete delete delete emails one by one for like 5-10 minutes a day. Now, why he didn’t just set up a rule to move them automatically? Why he didn’t contact IT and get a different email address? Why he didn’t sort them alphabetically and shift-click and delete them in one go? I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t know those were options. Either way, my guy spent hours and hours over the course of a couple years tidying up his email inbox constantly. And every so often I’d hear a frustrated groan or sigh and just know he was deleting more fucking emails. And every time I’d chuckle to myself. Fast forward he puts in his notice. On his last day, as he’s about to pack his belongings I said “hey I have one last thing for you” and I told him everything.

GotG was also a lot of fun and looked amazing.  The voices are distracting in how different they are from the MCU Guardians...it's like they're the Kmart brand Guardians.  The gameplay itself is fun, and once you get past the ""wrongness"" of the voices, the characters and dialogue are really entertaining.  Mantis steals the show.  My biggest complaint is that there's no replayability to it.  Once you beat it, there's really no reason to go back and play it again.

if you glimpsed the future
and were frightened by what you saw,
what would you do with that information?
You'd go to...
The politicians?
Captains of industry?
And how would you convince them?
Data?
Facts?
Good luck.
The only facts they won't challenge
are the ones that keep the wheels greased
and the dollars rolling in.
But what if...
What if there was a way of skipping the middle man...
and putting the critical news directly into everyone's head?
The probability of widespread annihilation kept going up.
The only way to stop it...
was to show it.
To scare people straight.
'Cause what reasonable human being
wouldn't be galvanized
by the potential destruction of everything they've ever known or loved?
To save civilization...
I would show its collapse.
But how do you think this vision was received?
How do you think people responded
to the prospect of imminent doom?
They gobbled it up
like a chocolate ecclair.
They didn't fear their demise.
They repackaged it.
It could be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.
The entire world
whole heartedly embraced the apocalypse!
and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.
Meanwhile...
your earth was crumbling, all around you.
You've got simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starvation!
Explain that one.
Bees and butterflies start to disappear...
The glaciers melt...
Algae blooms...
All around you.
The coal mine canaries are dropping dead
and you won't take the hint!
In every moment,
there is the possibility of a better future...
but you people won't believe it.
And because you wont believe it
you won't do what is necessary to make it a reality.
So you dwell on this ""Oh terrible future""
you resign yourselves to it.
For one reason:
Because that future
doesn't ask anything of you...
Today!
So, yes...
We saw the iceberg.
We warned the Titanic.
But you all just steered forward anyway.
Full steam ahead.
Why?
Because you want to sink.
You gave up.

I have this disease, and I’m one of the most severe cases – I can eat about 10 foods, total.

spnsnk,hwgd2db,t3_spnsnk,"Vivien Leigh (she played Scarlett O'Hara in *Gone With The Wind)* had been sexually abused when young. Years later, she performed in the play *A Streetcar Named Desire*, which involved her character getting raped every night by Marlon Brando's character. She was reliving her own sexual assaults, which led her to have a nervous breakdown.

When filming *The Shining*, the director decided to have the cast [be abusive to the female lead (Shelley Duvall) to help her to act more terrified and abused as her character becomes more terrified and abused.](https://www.slashfilm.com/726299/how-the-shining-changed-shelley-duvall-forever/) The treatment had a negative impact on her mental health permanently.  During the shoot, she started crying all day, and her hair started falling out. Now, she's seriously mentally ill (not all from the movie, probably also from other stuff).

On the set of the movie The Twilight Zone, the director (John Landis) was super passionate to get a certain shot with a helicopter and was careless about the safety issues.

spnpfw,hwgd2tv,t3_spnpfw,"So it seems my answer is going to differ from most:
Lust for me is general attraction,  mainly physical but not always, that is somewhat like a first or general impression; it isnt necessarily wanting to fuck, Moreso just wanting to get to know them on a personal level, it's more of a drive more or less. Lust can range from something as wholesome as liking their smile to picking up on their intelligence and liking it. It isn't always a ""you're fuckable thing"" (though it still can be) , but rather a drive 

Love is the stage after lust. After some time, a connection is formed and love is when you compliment/complete your partner and vise versa. But love is also the will to grow and change with the one you love, through thick and thin. Love is grown from trust and bonds.

For me, the perfect relationship is a balance of the two, but it can change from person to person",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644547317.0

spnj6e,hwgeqs5,t3_spnj6e,"Ok, this is going to sound weird, but I feel like I only recently, in my mid 30s, learned what real heartbreak is. I've had girls I thought I loved dump me, girlfriends dump me, and crushes tell me to take a hike. All of it was awful. There was heartache and sadness. But I think a lot of that was the sting of rejection. Parents split when I was a tween. Dad waved bye-bye and we haven't talked since. Maybe I have issues because that but it wasn't heartbreak. 

Oddly, the thing that broke me was my cat dying 1.5 years ago. I had him for 14 years. He was on my desk while I worked. I went to the bathroom and when I came back he had gotten up, walked across the room, then collapsed. He died in my arms a few minutes later as I frantically dialed vets. No warning. No symptoms.

My life had been totally upturned before that. Wife and I moved across the country for an incredible job opportunity mid 2019, we had a kid 6 months later, then when our kid was about a month old we went into covid lockdown. We decided to move back east when long term WFH was announced.

 So now in 2 years I lost a community of coworkers I had for 10 years. Had 2 stressful cross country moves 1 of which happened during peak covid  (my wife, our newborn, our cat had to live in a tiny af SUV because it was all that was available). My wife was struggling with the transition to being a mom because we didn't have family available to give us any support and I had a new boss who was such a dick at what was supposed to be a great job so even that was going badly.

Anyway, through all this and some other shit my cat was there. I took care of him and we had a routine. He trusted me. When he went I was just abso-fucking-lutely gutted. I've never cried like that before. Days of crying. It was like the last part of my life as I knew it was gone. I replay that 15 minutes in my head all the time. Can't talk about it or even write down the details because almost 2 years on and I still have to compartmentalize everything.

I've never known a sense of loss like this. It changed me for sure. The experience has made me more empathetic. The emotion is more intense and raw than anything I've ever experienced. Anyway, this is way longer than I expected it to be. Thanks for reading.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644548071.0

spngff,hwgb70h,t3_spngff,"Find an instrument you at least enjoy the idea of maybe one day being kind of good at playing. Find a very, very beginner book of basics (usually called a  “primer”). For every instrument there is generally going to be a book (or a hundred books) that will teach you the parts of the instrument, hand positions, & little exercises you can do to learn scales. Doing the scales will help you learn the notes it makes at each individual place where you hands can change what sound it makes. You don’t have to learn the technical names of those notes, but it would definitely make things easier on you if you have trouble distinguishing notes by the sounds of them. Once you have scales down you can learn things like chords. Once you have some scales & some chords down, you can learn how to make all those things work together to make songs.

You can also use the internet for these things & there are probably thousands of YouTube videos that will explain things just as well as any book would.

Finding an instrument teacher could be helpful. I don’t know how much they cost these days but my great aunt taught me some piano & I had a couple guitar teachers. Great aunt taught me for free & the teachers taught me for like $17 per session (but this was way back in the late 90s, early 2000s). Teachers can be found online or in person. Find someone with a lot of happy student reviews.

If you're hypoaroused, and you're too exhausted to think or reshift your mind; reshift your body.
Roll around on the floor like a maniac. Do jumping jacks. Run down the street. Scream into the night. Whatever restarts things.

When you are able; reach out. Co regulate with another human. Call a helpline or textline.

You reaching out to us is brave; you want to be here and you're seeking help.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644546328.0

Almost all of our systems are unconscious, even the sensory systems are mostly unconscious. We can focus our awareness on them and control them and even build a habit, like practicing breathing through your nose for example instead of your mouth, you consciously focus on it if you want to change, than it becomes automatic.

Newspapers really screwed themselves by not making subscriptions necessary to access on the internet. Obviously plenty of people would’ve found ways to get around paywalls, but even an honor-system attempt to get people to pay on a subscription model from the get go would’ve kept revenue in their pockets.

Then with lots of places choosing to advertise their businesses maybe once in the Sunday paper but every single day online, newspapers lost more revenue.

So a lot of them went from being able to afford very ethical & credible writers, & quality investigative journalists to basically only being able to afford less experienced (& thus less ethical) to zero experienced writers

Once the trends in writing in print changes, the trends in what gets read on the radio or read from the news desk teleprompters changes too.

I don’t follow any specific journalists or publications, I keep more of a “trust but verify” mindset about national events & issues, as well as politicized local events & issues.

The fact that we have heavy metals on our planet literally means that we are made out of the remains of a star that went through it's entire existence and died before our star was even born. Add to that that so far the record for life as we know it existing on planets that meet the criteria to support it is 1 out of 1.   


It's the height of hubris to think that in a universe with so many stars that we don't have words to for numbers that large (just billions of billions, or maybe billions of billions of billions) that we're the only rock special enough for life to form. 

&#x200B;

Since we've known enough to realize that the stars were other suns far away from us, we've assumed that those other suns would have their own planets, and that some of those planets would be rocky, like our inner planets, and some would be gas giants. Why did we assume that? Because we looked around and said ""Well,  the same mechanism that made all this stuff probably did the same thing lots of other places.   


And it turns out we were right. No we have telescopes finding new planets all the time. We've even been able to detect atmospheres on planets orbiting other stars. But we are a long way from being able to see life with the technology we have.   


Still, we can apply that same logic - given similar conditions, the same mechanisms that gave rise to life on Earth very likely created life on other planets, and there are a shit ton of other planets out there. It may only be 1 star in a million that has life around it currently, and maybe of those with life only 1 in a million has what we would call intelligent life currently. So out of the whole Galaxy that would give us one or two worlds with intelligent life. But there are hundreds of billions, if not trillions of Galaxies in the universe.

Suddenly the block pushes down onto Wendels exposed head. Wendel screams as he sees it slide down, down and down and down, the soft wet slurps and squelches it makes off the slime cannot be heard as the little boy begs and screams and pleads and waits. His lips become wet with manic froth as he pleads and promises for his freedom. He promises obedience. He promises loyalty. The block comes down and down and down. The little boy's  words become squeaky with desperation. He promises slavery, he promises anything! He promises blowjobs.  
  
But now only a thick, meaty squelching begins as the block begins to transform Wendel's pretty little preteen head into nothing but wet sludge.  
  
Wendel's body thrashes and flails in puny, spastic panic as the block pushes and pushes with dominance, dominance, steady unstoppable dominance. Below his hips his fit naked legs jig violently like he's doing a crazy dance, with the occasional wet squeak when his shiny latex fetish ankletop platform boots spack up against each other. The stiff latex shirt responds to the spastic flailing of his arms with a wild squeaky cacophony like freestyle jazz. Lower and lower goes the block. Squelch, squelch. At least the rubbery screech of pert latex helps drown out the slow, horrible wet slurp of meat being turned to pulp! Thrash, thrash. Squeak, squeak.  
  
Somehow in the midst of all the body-thrashing and manic squeaking and pulped head-meat, Wendel's arms suddenly defy their spastic panic. They jerk violently upward towards the block, the sudden movement provoking a loud squeaky cheer from the stiff unyielding shirt. Wendel thrashed and flailed at the block with all the unpulped brain he had left, the latex worked up into a rubbery frenzy! He   
thrashed and thrashed, squeaksqueaksqueak, thrashed and flailed, squeak, squeak. The block pushed deeper, deeper, deeper in into Wendel's precious brain-meat. Wendel's flailing became more and more spastic. Push. Push. Squelch. Squelch. No more thrash. Not enough brain left to thrash. Push. Push. Squelch. Squelch.  
  
The block pushes, it pushes, yes slowly but firmly it pushes, push, push, push until Wendel has been turned slowly, gently, into a vegetable.   
  
Push. Push. Squelch. Squelch. No more thrash. Not enough brain left to thrash. Push. Push. Squelch. Squelch. Wendel is becoming less squeaky as the twitches and jerks of his pert little body begin to calm.  
  
Hands claw and spack weakly against the smooth, slippery sides of the block in spastic, lobotomised defiance. So much spunk. So much willpower. Push. Push. Squelch. Squelch.  
  
The high neckline of the shirt is slowly and squeakily being bent downward where the adam's apple would be if Wendel was more than twelve-years-old. The block sinks further, bending the neckline right back with a long, wet squeak, curving right back and down like it was pledging obedience to Wendel's new head. Push. Push. Wendel has almost been fully processed! There is but one thing more for his prcess to be complete. Push, push, PUSH-  
  
As the block finally touched the floor, Wendel's hands flopped obediently, daintily to his sides. The only sounds are delicate rubbery squeaks as Wendel's pert little body twitches softly, jiggles softly, the gentle dance of fit young processed boyhood. Now that Wendel's cute, fetish preteen body has been purified, his pretty little rag-doll body shall be given a new brain, a wonderful brain of slimes and fluids and juices, and it shall think nought but obedience!  
  
The little boy's body shall be used to pleasure special gentlemen who enjoy the tight, pert, fresh young intimacy of boys who have not yet become pubescent. In their realm, it is forbidden to poke their erect penises inside a preteen boy. That is why we have begun the practice of abducting fit, pert little underage boys and removing the most disobedient part of their body. When the boy has been cleansed of the brain and head, they are nothing but love-dolls made of pert, tight, smooth, pink boyhood.  
  
  
Cocks will twitch and leak at the thought of the fit little underage boy-bod beneith the pile of pulped head-meat. Once his body has been cleaned of the sludge beneith the block, Wendel will begin his new, correct destiny as a kinky underage fetish-doll. The leather shirt shall be sealed over the top of his neck. Where his pretty little loli-boy face was, a leather mask shalt be attached to the shirt at the top of the neck, shiny and stiff with a big smile upon the front like those masks from the theature. Since Wendel is a Fetish-Doll, his body shall be unwashed. His tight little chocolate lips may even be left soiled. Fetish-Boys are always smelly.

spmeo9,hwgd858,t3_spmeo9,"I once pitched my tent in a Walmart parking lot.

A few years ago, I loaded a bunch of camping gear onto my bicycle and spent the better part of the next seven months riding 5,300 miles (8,500 km) around much of the US. For a few years before I left on this trip, my father had been living in a small camper van traveling around the country. Because of his experiences, I knew that Walmart is super chill about RVs parking for the night in their lots, at least at 24 hour stores.

One day as I was biking across Wyoming, I stopped at a Walmart in the early evening to resupply on food for the coming days. As I was packing my food into the bags on my bike, I noticed a few RVs pulling in for the night. So I decided I would just camp there for the night, mainly just because I wanted to see if I could get away with doing so in a tent.

I set up my tent in a parking space off to one side of the parking lot, in the general area where most RVs were setting up. At one point during the night, it sounded like people were drag racing up and down the aisle just feet from my head. A little later, a small group of what sounded like teenagers threw pebbles at my tent until I yelled at them to fuck off. I got maybe an hour of sleep that night. But nobody from Walmart kicked me out or even scolded me for it, so I considered the experiment a success and then promised myself to never do that again.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644547384.0

spm95n,hwgdb37,t3_spm95n,"I interned for a zoo and there was this one old lady who would come in every single day (all day) and just watch one of the exhibits. I'm going to keep it vague since the exhibit in question is a pretty rare zoo animal. She would come in on her electric scooter and film videos of the animals and talk in the background (or directly tell guests) saying blatantly false statements about their habits and daily routines. 

For example, the particular animals in that exhibit sway side to side, which she claims is a response to stress. When, in fact, this was *originally* a stress response that started in the circuses which eventually spread to zoos because some of those circus animals would take that habit with them. The habit is continued because the public perceives this as a stress response and, to get them to stop, zookeepers have to give them treats or a distraction to stop it. This essentially trains the animal to sway side to side for treats, so the animals at that particular exhibit would always go and sway by the door of their barn around dinnertime because they associate it with being fed. None of these animals were ever in the circus but one came from a situation in which they encountered an abused circus animal, and the habit was picked up. The animals show no other signs of distress while doing this behavior.

This is a known phenomenon. The zookeepers have explained this behavior many times and backed it up with peer reviewed research, but this woman does not listen. She's photoshopped photos of the barn and exhibit to make them look darker than they really are. She's made completely false claims about the animals attacking each other. She once told somebody that one of the animals was standing by the barn door because the zookeepers ""commanded"" her to prevent the other animal from attacking her. Firstly, those animals don't know a ""stay"" command. Secondly, it was 10 minutes before dinnertime and this very elderly animal has arthritis. Of course she's hanging out by the door waiting for dinner instead of frolicking way out in the yard. She's suggested moving these animals to a sanctuary that the zoo actually has a close relationship and, funnily enough, that sanctuary has come out and said that nothing is wrong and that transporting members of this species that are this elderly would cause more harm than good and potentially kill them. This species does not cope well with relocation (hence why circuses are so bad for them), especially in old age.

Anyway, she sued the zoo. This has gone to trial multiple times and went to the state Supreme Court, and she has lost every single time because there is concrete evidence against everything she's saying. World-class experts have come in to evaluate the situation and they have all said the same thing: there is nothing wrong. Still, it has cost the city a lot of money in lawyers.

I wish this woman would focus her activism on places that *don't* religiously follow AZA regulation. This zoo follows every rule exactly, even when no one is looking. When the barns were closed to the public due to COVID I *still* followed every regulation that we followed before COVID. They don't even allow *cobwebs* to be in the barns above stalls. These zookeepers keep up to date on the latest scientific literature and are always trying new methods of enrichment for the animals. There are factory farms, circuses, and non-AZA zoos that operate at a *much* lower standard. Would love to see her go after those Tiger King people.

In many ways, the zoo appreciates her. She means well. She is a helpful reminder to provide the best care possible and essentially ""keeps them on their toes."" This situation has led to a lot of good discussion about animal behavior and how it spreads even when the original cause is no longer there.

People are usually in final stages of hiv. I have never had a autoimmune disease.  I carried this virus for 1 half years before I could convince the prison system I was dying. 
   So I faked a panic attack and went septic and was rushed to a Memphis tn hospital were I was flown to Vanderbilt medical. In Nashville TN. I had a spinal tap and my infectious disease doctor told me I have meningitis and their is only one treatment that could possibly work. Well they tried the treatment and i flat lines 1 min into treatment and I found out I was highly allergic to the only treatment know to man. So they moved me to icu agian and gave me insane amounts of benadryl while introducing the treatment in small amounts for 2 weeks and after 2 weeks I was able to receive the gull treatment but i still couldn't sit up I had to have my spine drained everyday and after that my head felt like it was exploding all day and all night.  So my neurologist placed a shunt bi lateral shunt in my spine and it went into my stomach.  I caught bacterial meningitis in the shunt had to have it removed and I still couldn't sit up. Wo they tried the other side and in process kinked my intestines and had to remove that one as well after I started puking up bile. So Dr Lee placed a vp shunt in my head which runs down my chest into my belly. And after just 30 mins after surgery I could sit up again. I was in prison through all this. I had on shackles the entire time. I got a bill from hospital at prison hospital for over 1 mil and I made parole the following week. I ended up getting the treatment for meningitis and now i have hydrocephalus which is were my spinal fluid stopped communicating with my spine so fluid would build up around my brain.  I couldn't see I seen double and sometimes was blind and I got home and hit my head wrong and bow I have 20 25 vision no headaches but i have a seizure disorder called comprehensive seizures and short term memory lose but I am Here.

around a decade ago a friend of mine set me up with a girl so i talked with her a bit through texts and calls and she seemed ok so we decided to go on the date.

we set the date on a saturday at around 4pm somewhere around 1 hour away from me and 5 minutes away from her (found this out later). 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet up she asked me to meet at 5:30 pm because something came up (i was already on my way there) of which i agreed and since i didnt wanna go back home and wait for another bus (it was winter and really cold) i decided to go to the mall and window shop.

after what seemed like forever of me waiting there and going through every shop i go to the restaurant and told her 10 minutes before that i was on my way there and she replied ok.

i waited for like 10 minutes and asked her when shes coming she called and told me to wait a bit that shes on her way. at this time i was already freezing my ass off since there was nowhere to go inside in the area and it was really really cold.

after waiting another 20 minutes because she kept texting me to wait a bit more she sends me a text and tells me that she cant come and that shes sorry. i said just ""ok, no problem"" but i was really angry and went back home.

afterwards she kept insisting and bugging me for another date of which i agree after awhile and i basically got stood up in the same way with less waiting on my end because i was done with it.

shes kept apologizing afterwards and wanted to make it up to me but i rejected going out with her anymore. about a week after this my friend tells me to go out for some drinks which i agreed too. she basically convinced my friend to take me out and instead of him seeing me it would be her. so when i walked in the restaurant where we were supposed to go for drinks (it had a bar) i was greeted by her.

during the date she basically apologized once about everything and acted as if everything was fine which kinda triggered me since i wanted to leave since i saw it was her there and not my friend but she kinda made a scene and i was too uncomfortable to think straight. 

during the ""date"" she slipped and said that the reason she cancelled both times was because she got back together with her ex.

Utter and complete bullshit.

In reality, Bligh was notably *easy* on his men for the day, and there is no record he ever ordered a flogging. He was known to allow men on watch in bad weather to come and warm up inside his own cabin. He and Fletcher Christian had been long-time BFFs before the Bounty.

The mutiny happened because after long, hard months at sea, the Bounty had a five-month layover in the tropical paradise of Tahiti, where many men in the crew began to live ashore with native women, and military discipline started to come unglued.

Bligh had to enforce increasingly-harsh restrictions, because the natives were eager for any sort of trade, and to get a little native tail, sailors were actually pulling nails out of the ship for trade. He came down hard on Christian because it was his job to keep the crew in line and he was failing at it.

So Christian and about half the crew mutinied, and set Bligh and 18 followers adrift in a small, dangerously-overloaded boat. In one of the most mind-boggling feats of survival seamanship in history, Bligh managed to navigate the boat some 3,500 miles to safety.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644541548.0

Our society has handed so dramatically over recent years that view that we’re completely mainstream and acceptable even ten years ago are now shouted down as bigotry (for example the idea the women are adult human females is seen as transphobic today, at least in some parts of the western world while ten years ago no one even questioned it). Hell, even right now there are some people who look on others in their own society as backwards bigots (e.g. vegans and meat eaters, progressive parents and people who circumcise their sons or smack their children). 

It’s inevitable, especially in the current political climate, that there is going to be a certain amount of glossing over these kinds of attitudes and behaviours that have become unpalatable or even completely unacceptable today which I think is a shame. This adds to the general ignorance of the population at large but also detracts from the true value of these people.

Instead, we became the last class in the school before it closed. With each semester, there were fewer and fewer people, no new ones, and it felt lonelier and lonelier. A lot of classes got cut, so we actually had to take some classes at another campus pretty far away. It was annoying.

Some people tried to transfer out, but other schools already knew the reason they were doing that was to get out of the situation, not because they actually liked the school they were attempting to go to, so other schools were less open to transfers than you'd think.

We tried to file a class action, but due to the difficulty certifying a class, and coming up with a good way to calculate damages, the suit didn't take off. On top of that, the school continued to charge full tuition and knew we had to pay because we couldn't leave. I graduated and never looked back.

splryt,hwgdue7,t1_hwg3hr2,"We were allowed to basically do whatever we wanted so long as it wasn’t illegal or in some other way a major problem to the school. There were fairly strict expectations about uniform, attendance, out of bounds areas etc that most people were held to. I was almost never told off (despite blatantly flouting rules) except by teachers who did not know who I was. I was regularly skipping 2/3 days a week at one point. I didn’t go to school on time for almost two years straight. I always took short cuts through areas that were out of bounds for safety reasons. And so on. 

Now to a certain extent a bit of leniency would have been good (not for the reason that they gave it - being that they were desperate to keep us at that school instead of us going to the competition if we weren’t happy - but because being ‘gifted’ results in a lot of problems and additional needs, being given freedom helped with that but didn’t actually address my problems). But allowing certain students to do whatever they want while coming down hard on others really isn’t a reasonable thing to do, if your uniform rules don’t really matter then don’t have them, if it’s fine for people to be late then stop telling them to do otherwise. 

To be honest I’m mostly glad I was treated that way, it was pleasant, but it’s only exacerbated some of my issues that stem from being different and I’m not certain it was necessarily good for me. It might have been unpleasant at the time but I might be a bit happier in my life now (albeit not necessarily doing well on objective measures as I am) if I had learn to play by the rules at least a little bit.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644547665.0

You want to unfuck your shit, and really fix your life instead of surviving on a bunch of fucking happy pills, there's only one way. Start doing things that you'll respect yourself for. 

First, you need to figure out what you're going to do to serve yourself, then the people around you, then the world, and why. I can't answer that for you, but I can give you my example. I serve myself with knowledge, good food, and exercise because I want to be healthy and able to serve my family for as long as I can. I serve my family with my time and what little wisdom I have, because I want to give my wife and kids better opportunities than I ever had. And I serve the world by helping a small business run, and providing the best gun parts I can possibly build, because I believe that the world's liberty and prosperity goes hand in hand with economic freedom and capacity for individual violence, but that's another subject.

Look at people you respect. Heroes, athletes, strong businessmen, soldiers, bodybuilders, whatever. I don't know who you look up to, figure it out. Then start asking yourself what they had to do to get there. What you can take from their path and apply to your own. *Then start fucking doing it.*

Look, I don't know your situation. This shit I just laid out involves changing your habits and goals. It may involve changing your environment and your social group. You might have to walk away from your family, and that's a rough fucking road. I've done it. But where are you going to be in ten years if you just maintain the status quo? And where might you be if you start doing those things that make you uncomfortable?

I remember watching a science fiction movie that stuck with me. In it there were people that were hanging out and playing pool. The movie then kind of subverts it with people playing with holograms and stuff like that. The point they were driving home is that people are going to be people no matter what time what period.

So I had the job of taking a female friend back home from a night of drinking. She was the literal definition of ""white girl wasted"" that night. So we get to her house and I walk her inside to her bedroom. So now as I'm trying to put my friend into her bed she falls to her knees and face plants into my crotch. In my head I'm like ""Fuck! I hope no one sees this."" and to my surprise the next thing I hear is ""So that's how it is..."" I look over to the door way and see my friend's sister just standing there looking back at me with her arms crossed and hip shifted. Then I'm like ""It's not what it looks like"" the next thing I hear is ""I know. I'm just fucking with you."" That gave me some sort of relief but the awkwardness level of the situation was through the roof in this moment. But yeah I end up putting my friend to bed with the help of her sister. Then saw my way out of the house. So that's my story.

It was like one of those old Tom and Jerry cartoons were Tom catches the entire cabinet of dishes, balancing them on his toes and shit, except we didn't catch most of it and ended up covered in dust and cleaning supplies.

So I took off my shirt and pants and threw them in the washer, and my roommate did the same, then we used the laundry sink to wash off any remaining mess from our skin.

We walked out of the laundry room in our underwear and glistening like we had just worked up a good sweat, to find my girlfriend walking in from work and looking at us like she just caught us in the middle of something.

That place is a paradise whilst still being (relatively) close to the city. People dump on this city all the time ""Sydney is crowded. Sydney is dirty. Sydney is full of traffic. Sydney is too expensive"" but something tells me none of these things are an issue in for the average northern and eastern coastal suburbs resident unless they're *really* stretching their budget to live there. It's a totally different lifestyle and I just wish I were rich enough to be in on it. Everyone else on my end seems to be happy here, or at least not as agitated over it as I am and don't really give it any thought. But for years now I've always wanted to jump ship from the south-west to the northeast. I mean the quality of living here is still good compared to 90% of the rest of the world but I'm just tired of unbearable summers in a land-locked, heat-sink suburb with nowhere to swim other than a *kinda* tacky public pool, trashy people mouthing off in public on a regular basis, unkempt houses and yards on every street, frequent vandalism, not enough trees and the people who are in the ""nicer"" parts here doing well for themselves thinking they're hot-shit when they'd be *dwarfed* by the insane amounts of wealth and success in the north and eastern parts so they should probably get over themselves since as I always say to anyone willing to listen to my rant ""if they were that rich they wouldn't be living *here*"". Sydney's south-west sucks. I'm only here because I can't afford there and my house here will at least be an investment for the future but shopping for a place in the northern beaches is gonna be one of my first moves if I ever win Powerball which is probably the only way I'll ever get to.

If I were to ever look overseas and again - if money wasn't such a big hurdle I'd probably pick somewhere in coastal SoCal which offers a very similar lifestyle to what I want out of north Sydney.

What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin, as I said
And worse
They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!
Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums of war!
They're savages! Savages!
Dirty redskin devils!
Now we sound the drums of war!
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed
Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside
I wonder if they even bleed
They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!
Killers at the core
They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted
We must sound the drums of war
They're savages! Savages!
First we deal with this one
Then we sound the drums of war
Savages! Savages!
Let's go kill a few, men!
Savages! Savages!
Now it's up to you, men!
Savages! Savages!
Barely even human!
Now we sound the drums of war!
Is there nothing I can do?
Will this really be the end?
Is it only death that waits
Just around the riverbend?
This will be the day ...
(Let's go men!)
This will be the morning ...
(Bring out the prisoner)
We will see them dying in the dust
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try
Now we make 'em pay
Eagle, help my feet to fly
Now without a warning ...
Mountain, help my heart be great
Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust
Spirits of the earth and sky ...
It's them or us
Please don't let it be to late ...
They're just a bunch of
Filthy, stinking
Savages!
Savages!
Demons!
Devils!
Kill them!
Savages!
Savages!
What are we waiting for?
Destroy their evil race
Until there's not a trace left
How loud are the drums of war
We will sound the drums of war
(Savages! Savages!)
Now, we sound the drums of war
(Savages! Savages!)
Now we see what comes
Of trying to be chums
Now we sound the drums ... of ... war!
Of course it means the drums ... of ... war!
Is the death of all I love
Carried in the drumming of war?",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1644539821.0

“The study was based on the idea that there is an overlap between the memory systems responsible for recalling speech and music and those systems responsible for actually producing speech and music,” says C. Philip Beaman, the study’s lead author and an associate professor of cognitive science at the Centre for Cognition Research and the School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading, U.K.

Then I made a sort of scalloped Taters recipe. 

Heavy whipping cream, cheeses of choice, preferably easy to melt. I use heavy whipping cream, some butter for extra flavor, fresh cracked pepper, salt to taste. 

As for cheeses I would go for cheddar, not too sharp as it is dry and doesn't give the texture you want, and feta. Heat up all that, add to your rather thickly cut potatoes, bake in oven covered.

Along with the cheddar I would use fresh shredded asiago and parmesan. Before finishing the bake, cover the potatoes with the shredded cheeses, bake until desired brownass is obtained. Then finally, top with green onions.

Salmon, bake. Remove rosemary and lemon before serving.

Veggies, a small stir fry. I love asparagus, squash, green beans, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. 

A healthy alternative to the potatoes would be to look up a cauliflower mash recipe and my god, dome right is so much tastier than smashed Taters. My roommate and I finished it in a day or two.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644540561.0

Completed it, dead frog chopped up with ruthless efficiency, and then on the back of the test… there was a final question I saw on the back of the fucking test, 20% of the final was leveraged on this shitty question.

“What does a clown look like, draw and label.”

I have no artistic skill. I can’t push out a clown on the fly. I’m about to lose 20% of my final on a fucking fluke! Boner.

I began drawing to my limited capacity. Drawing, erasing, drawing, languishing in despair against the feeling of pencil dragging against paper. Boner strengthens and strains.

I’m wearing at this time a simple designed t-shirt, flannel print cargo shorts and running shoes. Cargo shorts have a noticeable tent at this point, my mind has lost the blitzkrieg battle against anxiety and male flesh.
