PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WZTV) ‚Äî Dollywood on Tuesday announced they'll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

Piloted by Dolly Parton's operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it's an opportunity for employees to grow.

""One of The Dollywood Foundation‚Äôs key tenets is to ‚Äòlearn more.‚Äô This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation‚Äôs other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.""
The program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks & Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said. ""We care about our hosts‚Äô development and we want their future to grow because of love‚Äînot loans.""",1644420031.0

Then when they launch into the chorus Summers continues his guitar part with just a little single-note riff that repeats over and over throughout the chorus.

It's super catchy and so fun to play!

In an Instagram post today, Kanye West has demanded that Billie Eilish apologize to Travis Scott. At a concert earlier this week, Eilish stopped her show and said ‚ÄúI wait for people to be OK before I keep going‚Äù when a fan needed an inhaler. Kanye took that as shade toward Scott, who Kanye said will perform with him during his headlining Coachella 2022 set. Eilish is also a headliner at this year‚Äôs festival. He wrote:

COME ON BILLIE WE LOVE YOU PLEASE APOLOGIZE TO TRAV AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES NO ONE INTENDED THIS TO HAPPEN TRAV DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE AND WAS VERY HURT BY WHAT HAPPENED AND YES TRAV WILL BE WITH ME AT COACHELLA BUT NOW I NEED BILLIE TO APOLOGIZE BEFORE I PERFORM

In a comment on that post, viewed by Pitchfork, Eilish responded, ‚Äúliterally never said a thing about travis. was just helping a fan.‚Äù

On November 5, 10 people died at Travis Scott‚Äôs 2021 Astroworld Festival in Houston. The ages of the victims ranged from ages 9 to 27 and the deaths were ruled from compression asphyxia. Scott was heavily criticized for the festival‚Äôs lack of safety and for continuing to perform while the crowd was in panic. 

In an interview Travis was asked by Charlamagne tha God, ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs hard to tell excitement from danger, so to speak?‚Äù Scott responded, ‚ÄúYeah, of course, everything kind of just sounds the same, and, at the end of the day, you just hear music.‚Äù Travis and Live Nation were sued, and the House Oversight and Reform Committee is looking into promoter Live Nation‚Äôs role in the deadly concert.",1644543460.0

spalek,Artists/bands whose style changed so drastically one wouldn't have recognized them anymore,0,0.33,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/spalek/artistsbands_whose_style_changed_so_drastically/,11,"Best example in my opinion would be Fleetwood Mac.

They begin as one of the many bands of the British blues movement, their original singer and guitarist Peter Green also was one of the many members of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers; their sound however was a bit more dry and less mainstream and psychedelic than the one of Cream or the Jimi Hendrix Experience. A bit like early Led Zeppelin. It was in a bit of a middle of the black blues from the States of John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters and the mainstream hard rock of the Who and the Rolling Stones. Typical were songs like 'Black Magic Woman' and 'Stop Messin Around'. A huge exception was the melodic instrumental 'Albatross' which gave the blues a bit more melodic sound. Thank you, Peter Green :)

After Green left the band, Jeremy and Christine came and while the blues didn't disappear, the sound became softer, yeah, it would turn into soft rock, but not THE soft rock we'd hear later, it would rather border into folk rock. Over the years, the two Bobs - Welch and Weston - would join the band, as well as Dave Weston, who would provide vocals for one of the most unorthodox FM songs in my humble opinion: 'The Derelict'. Even then already blues rock was no longer their main sound, but it wasn't gone either, see songs like 'The City'"". Then, Walker and both Bobs left the band also. Left were only the two men who were responsible for the band to exist in the first place: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie.

And then, the era we all know began. With Lindsey and Nickie. Which also lead into the mainstream rock sound of the 1980's. Hard to find similarities between those many phases. Only the drummer and bassist have always remained the same. Now Lindsey's gone too, and former Crowded House front singer Neil Finn took his place.

Talking about that, Neil Finn also went through lots of changes. Started of in an all Kiwi band, Split Enz, at first an art rock band, but then brought post-punk into the music. Neil's older brother Brian Timothy was the vocalist, but eventually they decided to let Neil sing. And in 1980 their most well known album 'True Colors' (which I happen to own) came out and despite being very punky, the band now was shifting into a clear New Wave sound, which then would continue with Crowded House's debut album. However, even here we already had signs of the future alternative rock sound, best example being the US hit 'Something So Strong' (which sounds strongly like an R.E.M. song if y'all ask me!). And they also would eventually make journeys into funk ('Chocolate Cake')  and jazz ('Sister Madly'). And I believe it was worth it. Tim BTW also played gutiar for the 'Woodface' album.

Similarly are Jefferson Airplane, Jefferston Starship and Starship. Three bands or one? Hard to say in my opinion. The female lead singer has always remained the same. Just that the first band was a psychedelic rock band with their greatest hits 'Somebody Love' and 'White Rabbit'. A typical two hit wonder at first. But then it bordered into a new band that would remain the psychedelic rock sound in some sense, but made it more 70's ish and more melodic. And finally, Starship with Mickey Thomas as the new male voice, leading into songs like 'Sara', 'We Built This City' and 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'. Now the psychedelic influences were gone entirely, they played the typical adult oriented arena rock sound. But the female voice had never changed.

And of course, a lot more important, Genesis. Started off as a Beatles ripoff, before Steve Hackett and Phil Collins joined the band and made them prog. I sadly only own 'Selling England By The Pound', but that one is perhaps one of the more underrated prog albums. But then Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett left the band 'And Then They Were Three'. They just became your average pop rock band. Not horrible, but nothing special. Phil certainly was better on vocals solo than he was with Genesis. He made Genesis what it was from 'Nursery Cryme' on, and even the first two albums with him as a vocalist were still prog, but with Hackett's departure everything ended, and what came out was what we all heard from the Top 40 stations.

Just like Phil Collins recorded several solo albums, Mike Rutherford made his own band with Mike & the Mechanics and the two Pauls, Carrack (IMHO a strongly underrated vocalist, we also known him as the vocalist of Ace's 'How Long' and Squeeze's 'Tempted') and Young (not to be confused with the other Paul Young, ironically, Paul Carrack sang in duet with that one too) and landed a couple hits also. While Tony Banks however happened to prefer the prog sound on his solo albums, Peter Gabriel made his own pop sound different from the pop sound everyone else was making and Steve Hackett decided to experience classical. And on their final studio album... well, Ray Wilson of Stiltskin took the mic and gave them yet another 'new' sound.

Also Gary Moore, perhaps one of my favorites, comes to my mind. He first played in an own band that played bit of a jazz rock sound. Then he joined Thin Lizzy, and made his first solo album in a traditional hard rock sound. And that debute album already contained 'Parisienne Walkways' (with Phil from Thin Lizzy in the lead vocals). It was a bit of a foreshadowing, but would not define his sound of the 1980's. Instead, he'd play heavy metal, but with more influences of the stadium rock of the time, actually, in many songs he would sound like Steve Perry from Journey! (at least in my opinion, 'Empty Rooms' would be such an example) But after he released yet another hard rock/heavy metal album with 'After The War' in 89, just one year later the sound changed entirely and he now fully committed to blues rock. Not even the voice would suggest that it was the same man. In my opinion, this album gave blues rock a bit of a new sound. So far, Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler had defined the sound with their typical countryish riffs, but Gary looked at his role model BB King and decided to add some horns, which would also be a great inspiration for Joe Bonamassa, and in general, I wish there was more of that style. Guys like Jeff Healey, Stevie Ray Vaughn or Rory Gallagher were the definition for the American side of blues rock, and Gary obviously was not American, but he had little inspiration from the British or Irish side, so he developed his very own sound. It was surprisingly melodic, best example are of course 'Still Got The Blues' as well as 'Midnight Blues', 'Story of the Blues', 'Seperate Ways' and so on. However, later he would return to his hard rock style with a bit more electric sound. But his life showed that the blues was all he ever wanted :)

Let me start with the elephant in the room, Bohemian Rhapsody.
This song is an absolute masterpiece, a true stroke of genius from Freddie, Brian, John and Roger.
The guitar solo flows so well into the operatic section, and the high note at the end of that section, is truly impeccable. The reflection at the end of the song leaves a satisfying end.

I Am In Love With My Car's lyrics are quite strange but the beat and backround music is smooth and seamless.

You Are My Best Friend's lyrics are very catchy and a good song to sing along to, and the best at the beggining feels satisfying and sentimental, allowing room for happy lyrics.

1. You stay with a huge percentage of what you sell. It doesn't work with underpaid streams.
2. Bandcamp allows you to make great promotions whenever you want.
3. It has cool features like connecting with your fans, selling merch, etc
4. It has a vynil press service
5. More cool stuff

If you are interested you can watch the video I made following this link [https://youtu.be/jcZA7eJ2ljw](https://youtu.be/jcZA7eJ2ljw) or enter directly to the official Bandcamp website and read it by yourself.

**Art and Entertainment**

Music is composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious ceremony or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was available in sheet music scores such as in the classical and romantic era,¬† music lovers were buying¬† the sheet music of their favorite songs and perform them at home on the piano.

With the advent of tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the¬† 1990s,¬† music lovers could tape a¬† playlist of their favorite songs and take them on a portable cassette. ¬†People learn music from institutions or by the help of internet.

My older, tweenaged brother began listening to rock radio after he grew tired of '00s boy bands and top 40 hits. Naturally, I was going to follow my brother's musical tastes purely on the basis of exposure. Rock radio ruled my teens, exposing me to '80s hair metal, '90s grunge/post-grunge, and '90s-'00s nu-metal. Disturbed was, of course, a mainstay in those years. As middle schoolers we'd compete to see who could do the best ""OOO WA-AH-AH-AH"". I eventually found other (read: better) music, and transitioned out of this scene. By the time I left high school, I was fully immersed in albums and completely detached from the radio.

I ended my relationship with nu-metal nearly half my life ago, and it amazes me how many of these bands are still together, making the same sounds, 8+ albums in. That scene is still, evidently, raking in cash and it's not showing signs of stopping. Looking at the way culture persists since the mid-00s, this is sort of expected. The thing I wasn't expecting was that nu-metal would become so mainstream that it would become *mundane*. This leads me to the impetus behind this post:

# I heard Disturbed's cover of ""Sound of Silence"" in the grocery store the other day.

First, I need to address this particular cover of this particular song. Something that absolutely kills me is the need to make everything ""epic"" in this day and age. You take a serene, poignant, ambiguous protest song like ""Sound of Silence"" and you add distortion, a strong buildup, and David Draiman's signature vocals in some effort to make the song have more oomph, more power, to give it a new life or introduce it to a new generation. In my opinion, Disturbed's ""Sound of Silence"" is powerful in the way a 15-year-old would think it is. Perhaps the only thing I can be happy about regarding this cover is that it may introduce the original ""Sound of Silence"" to a new swath of 15-year-olds the same way seeing *Watchmen* in theaters introduced it to me.

Anyone who's listened to Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, or any MTV Unplugged concert knows that, sometimes, stripping a song down to its bare essentials brings out its beauty, and makes it more powerful. ""Sound of Silence"" is a brilliant song because of its stark instrumentation and its defiant, prophetic, and despairing lyrics. ""Sound of Silence"" is not supposed to be epic. Disturbed's cover is the definition of overdoing it when it comes to a song that's supposed to be quiet, haunting, and foreboding. 

Somehow, this cover has managed to eclipse all of Disturbed's discography. It's got more listens than ""Down with the Sickness"" on Spotify, and is within striking distance of having more listens than the original ""Sound of Silence"". Clearly this has struck a chord culturally, and it's actually impressive considering the song was released in 2015. Was it in some movie I didn't see? Was it played at sporting events? (I say this because I saw a teenager figure skating to it the other day in the Olympics.) Or was it pounded into mundanity by corporate overlords who decided it would be ripe to play in grocery stores?

Let's talk about *grocery store music*. It's important to remember that everyone inside of a grocery store is a captive audience to the corporate radio that plays there (unless they have earbuds in). Therefore, the assumption placed on this music is that it needs to be agreeable music for everyone and anyone. There's also the assumption that it will serve as appropriate background music (i.e. muzak) for your shopping. As a total music snob, I'd have to put these among the worst assumptions to be placed on a piece of music. Any artist would ask that their music be paid attention to, and even judged, regardless of the haters. But in a grocery store, you can't turn it off, and you can't turn it louder. You instead have to accept that the music will become a part of the store's predictable, expected, mundane ambiance.

I don't know how else to say this: if I deeply respect you as an artist or a band, then I most likely don't want to hear you in a store as agreeable, mundane background noise. This isn't to disparage soft rockers like John Mayer, or Tracy Chapman, or even Kenny G. They obviously didn't choose to have their music contextualized in this way. Still though, when I hear a song I like in a grocery store, I can't help but think ""You deserve better than this."" 

To wrap up, when I heard Disturbed's ""Sound of Silence"" in the grocery store a bunch of thoughts went through my head:

1. Wow, here in the year of our lord 2022, I've officially heard Disturbed in a grocery store.
2. I forgot this cover existed. I remember when Disturbed did that Genesis cover all those years ago and people were confused and ambivalent and I didn't even know it was a cover until like a year later. That's probably happening again right now.
3. ""Sound of Silence"" is such a beautiful song and this is such a shitty treatment of it.
4. Does anyone else see the irony in a song that's about people not communicating being played in a grocery store where people brush by each other avoiding eye contact? No? Just me?
5. Nu-metal has crossed the line from being the bumper music for traditionally masculine forms of content like blacksmithing videos and UFC fights, to being agreeable, grocery store-grade muzak.
6. This is a real step up in intensity from traditional grocery store soft rock. The vamp-up at the latter end of the cover is simply on a different dynamic level, and it's strange to hear it while I'm looking at toilet paper.
7. God I fucking hate this cover, and I can't turn it off.

Anyway here's 5 from me. 

The love language - S/T. This album is so fun and just good from front to back,  it's thoughtful, poppy, catchy and fun indie rock and it deserves a listen. 

Grampall Jookabox - Ropechain. I'll be honest I like their first album better but it's not attitude as approachable and this had a wider appeal, but it's pure danceable psychedelic wonder and one time I did mushrooms and listened to this in 2 drives while eating ice cream sandwiches and everything was perfect for a bit. 

Margot and the nuclear so & so's - The dust of retreat.  This album is peak Midwest sad kid dreamy indie rock. It's loud when it needs to be and sad when it needs to be,  playful and thoughtful.  They're are like 5 follow-ups and solo work but this is my favorite still. 

Dear and the headlights - Small steps heavy hooves.  They're just so hard to describe but also so flawless, it's like 90's college rock with indie folk and a dash of good humor and imagination.  I just fucking love it.

Caroline Rose - Loner. The most recent entry but so so good.  Just pure fun loving powerpop from a gal that started in country or adjacent music for a few years and then seemingly figured herself out and went all in. Memorable synth layers,  no fat and at least 3 absolute bangers.

Last month, amid a wave of artist boycotts, Spotify added content warnings to its COVID-19 content to quell anger at vaccine misinformation hosted on the platform. The tweak did little to satisfy critics, and the New York state comptroller is among them, according to a letter obtained by Reuters. 

In the letter, comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees pension funds in the state, urged Spotify to let users more easily report misinformation, and requested details on how the platform handles content rules and enforcement, according to Reuters. DiNapoli cited complaints that Joe Rogan had spread misinformation, as well as reports of racist material. 

‚ÄúAs we have seen with other technology and media companies who host or publish content, the failure to successfully moderate content on a company‚Äôs platforms can lead to various reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks,‚Äù DiNapoli wrote in the letter, sent February 2, according to Reuters.

Mine Is Yours ‚Äì Cold War Kids

Much of the content here deals with personal growth, and some of the more uplifting lyrics have me on the verge of tears:

>It feels so strange to feel good  
And when I was the fire you were wood  
So when I was petrified  
You understood  
>  
>I have been broken open  
This was not my master plan  
I was comfortable watching from the stands  
I have been broken open  
>  
>All my edges are exposed  
I was once content alone  
Now you are the one that I call home  
I've been broken open

The way they examine coming out of your shell and finally having confidence in yourself just hits so close to home.

&#x200B;

Go Farther In Lightness ‚Äì Gang of Youths

Namely ""The Heart Is a Muscle,"" an exploration of getting yourself back out there after repeatedly having your heart broken.

>There will be no years of silence in the shadow of regret  
I won't let it so betray me, though my soul got used to it  
I will look at love as more than just an instrument of pain  
And will give myself completely to the moving and the strange

>I will not play this out discreetly, it is real and unashamed

Sorry, this isn't the typical music reddit post, but we're conducting research on festivals and thought we could reach a few of you if we posted something here.

We're passionate about **improving the festival experience** (music, conference, food etc) with **digital/technology**, especially now that we can attend them again after what the world has been through.

In order to do this, we‚Äôd really, really like to hear from **festival goers** about their previous event experiences. All good, bad and ugly experiences are welcome - we want to know it all!

Thank you <3

But I have to ask: are there any albums post-2005 that you guys think sound great on vinyl? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an unwritten rule or heavy suggestion to steer away from getting modern albums on vinyl, but I was just wondering if there any you guys believe to be exceptions. The most modern vinyl I have is *AM* ( 2013) by Arctic Monkeys, and admittedly as much I love the band and several songs on the album, I wasn‚Äôt that impressed hearing them on vinyl.

Anyone know of any other modern albums you believe sound great on vinyl? Or are you more against the idea of buying them? Let me know! I‚Äôm open to pretty much any genre except country.",1644388136.0

First, I do have a large library, and I have in the past changed file information one by one and it is so very tedious, and I've nearly doubled my library in the last 5 years.  So, I'd like to use a program to find and sort the album information.  However, I own a lot of video game music, through game rips, official albums, and steam soundtrack downloads, however, most of them don't show up in any of the info searches or separates them into smaller albums, even the ones that are the official releases, like ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D Official Soundtrack"", ""Ori and the Blind Forest Original Soundtrack CD"", or any of the Witcher soundtracks.  I've tried MediaMonkey, MusicBrainz, and Windows Media Player.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a program that can do that properly, or did I get unlucky enough to have a bunch of official compilation albums that were never uploaded?

Secondly, in more recent years, I've been getting albums that include multiple formats, mostly mp3 and flac, and those track sorting programs just bundle the mp3 and flac files into one folder.  Is there any program that can physically separate the flac, mp3, and wav files into separate folders AND rename them as such?",1644373259.0

I hid under the back porch, smell of damp summer earth cool under my hands, ducking, scrunching my shoulders tight to avoid the rusty nails waiting patiently above for my back or skull to forget them. The tingling along my back and neck kept reminding me, don't stand up. Under the back porch, a place tinged with danger and smelling of earth, the air tastes faintly of mold and hollyhocks twining around the trellises that I see only the bottoms of, speckled gold by the shafts of sun slipping through high elm branches in the backyard, weaving shadows like Grandma's lace dresser doilies.

Just wanted to give her channel a shout out, as she will likely grow into a very popular channel, but she currently only has 741 subscribers.

She plays livestreams every Thursday from her home, and often plays live at Bellevue Square Mall in Washington State.

She‚Äôs incredibly talented, especially with improvisation and composition. She plays solo piano in the style of Michael Gettel, George Winston, Tom Howard, Christopher Peacock, etc., with genres ranging from soft solo piano, jazz, popular showtunes, Disney classics, modern pop, and beyond.

Her best attribute in my opinion is the peace and tranquility of her music and playing, perfect for any needed moment of calm and relaxation.

Not sure where to ask this, but I thought r/music would be ok for it.

I'm trying to buy 2x tickets for Joe Hisaishi's London concert in August, but unfortunately they are sold out through the direct sellers.

Does anyone know any other avenues to take to purchase these tickets? Reliable resellers in London?

There are sellers on Viagogo, but from everything I've read on them I'd like to stay far away from that company.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If there were slightly better vocals and slightly less problematic lyrics I think scene music would actually be considered ""good"" by the majority.

sn7qbg,An unintended side effect of canceling my Spotify subscription: an incoming wave of nostalgia at the sight of my old iTunes library.,14,0.62,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sn7qbg/an_unintended_side_effect_of_canceling_my_spotify/,13,"So, I canceled my Spotify subscription last week. No points for guessing why. Since I use an iPhone, I figured I might as well switch to the Apple Music app that came pre-installed but which I'd never touched.

Imagine my joy when I open it up and see that my entire iTunes library, which has been tied to my Apple account for nearly twenty years now but had gone increasingly unused ever since I got a car with Bluetooth connectivity (so, around 2014), is right there. I barely even needed Apple Music's selection of playlists, not when I was too busy diving back into the vast collection of music that I'd assembled over the course of my middle school, high school, and college years.

'90s/early '00s alt-rockers from Pearl Jam to Alanis Morissette to Nirvana to Garbage to Michelle Branch to Oasis! Old-school hip-hop like N.W.A, Nas, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg, OutKast, and Tupac! So much pop-punk (blink-182, Sum 41, Paramore, MCR, The All-American Rejects, Avril Lavigne), metalcore/post-hardcore (Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, A Skylit Drive, A Day to Remember), and straight metal both modern (Disturbed, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Rob Zombie) and classic (Black Sabbath, Motley Crue, Pantera, Metallica)! Celtic punk like the Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly! (A side effect of growing up Irish on the East Coast. No regrets.) Classic rock like the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, AC/DC, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, and Pat Benatar! Early '10s pop singers like Lykke Li, Lana Del Rey, Rihanna, Lorde, CHVRCHES, Charli XCX, Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding, and I swear I must have been the only 'Merican in my graduating class who'd heard of Little Mix!

(And also my regrettable enjoyment of Trapt, Kid Rock, Lostprophets, and Blood on the Dance Floor at various points. *Brrrrrr.* I didn't need to remember *everything* about my youth, Apple.)

That's before getting into my TV and movie library. Granted, given how I'd never given up physical media for movies the way I had music, the impact wasn't as grand here, but it was still something.

Either way, just looking at my Apple Music library ported over from iTunes caused so much to come flooding back. The songs I listened to on the bus to school, on ski trips, in my room as I eagerly uploaded each new CD I purchased into my iMac, as I walked to my next class or back to my car in college. It felt like dusting off an old relic of my youth and finding that a lot of it still slaps. And I can still build on it, adding the artists I've discovered since alongside my old favorites. Hell, the fact that it's organized just like iTunes used to be, whereas Spotify's library, even if it does technically offer organization by artist and album, seems designed to funnel you into playlists designed for specific moods.

I think Todd in the Shadows hit upon something recently. Spotify's playlist structure has made ""vibes"" into the paradigm of pop music in the last five to ten years, with songs meant to flow together and serve as the soundtrack to your daily life. Songs for studying, songs for driving, songs for exercising, songs for the morning, songs for the evening. Apple Music and YouTube Music have playlists too, of course, and even before streaming, radio programmers knew what an ""at-work station"" and ""morning drive time"" were and what music was supposed to go there. But nobody does the soundtrack-ification of music quite like Spotify, who have made it central to how you listen to music on their platform -- and, because of Spotify's massive market share, central to how many people listen to music today.

There's another term for that sort of music meant to serve as a soundtrack to daily life. Muzak. A company devoted to just that sort of ""mood music"" for play in public places, their name became a byword for ""elevator music"", the crap that gets piped into elevators, malls, and waiting rooms in order to get you working and shopping, music designed to be non-intrusive and just *exist* as background noise. Spotify's main legacy, I feel, has been to make muzak as big as the British Invasion was in the '60s, or grunge was in the early '90s, as artists start writing songs around the playlists in order to land a spot on them.

Sorry to turn into my grouchy old parents, but my old iTunes library made me nostalgic not just for the specific songs and artists I loved in my youth, but also for the music landscape of the 2000s. Whether the songs in your library were uploaded from CDs, purchased for $0.99 a pop as singles, or acquired through... *other* avenues, there was still a sense of ownership and personal control over the music you listened to, whether you listened to it as individual songs, as albums, or in playlists of your own creation. That feels like it's gone away in a world where Spotify serves up algorithmically-generated playlists of songs for whatever mood you desire based on your listening habits. There's still tons of great music being made if you know where to look, but these playlists seem designed to make sure that you don't. I'm hoping that the current controversy knocks Spotify down a peg not just on general principle, but so it reduces their corrosive effect on popular music.",1644285295.0
