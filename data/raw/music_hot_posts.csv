Some Ukranian Gypsy Punk Rock for the occasion.  Great band and fantastic live shows.  The Lead is named Eugene Hutz.  He was also in one of my favorite movies-Everything Is Illuminated.  Which is about a young jewish man going to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis.  I also highly recommend it, too.  Hilarious and sad.

Edit:  see a lot of comments about how they aren’t a Ukrainian band because only the front man is Ukrainian.  I think this is one of those grey areas we can debate endlessly.  It’s more a matter of opinion.  I say Ukrainian, because the founder/composer/lead singer is Ukrainian.  Most of the music seems influenced by him and at most also the Russians in the band.  Some could argue they are an American band, because they are based in New York.  Labeling things is subjective at best.  I felt this was an appropriate label.  Regardless, it doesn’t matter, the music is still awesome.  Let’s just enjoy that.  It’s why we’re here.",1646442222.0

Like the title says, I worked on this album over the past 2-3 years, doing everything myself, from writing to performance to mixing and mastering. I posted my last album here as well back in 2018, and since then I became pretty obsessed with trying to make something better, and this record is the culmination of everything I came up since then.

This album is about the loss of a loved one, a really personal album to me that I sunk a lot of time and energy into. I'd really appreciate anyone taking the time to check it out and I'm down for any feedback/critique. I don't expect that it'll be everyone's cup of tea, but I'd appreciate anyone taking the time to listen. Thanks :)

We call for support and donations to those who had been hurted by President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and are in danger.

I want to have this place for people who have vague feelings and are anxious about this situation.

Date/time: 5th of March (sat) from 12:30 to sunset Place: South exit of Shinjuku station

# Statement of the event below

I’m against war.

I typed the word in and tried to post it, but my emotion couldn’t be settled and it certainly eroded my daily life.

The anger and sadness from the evilness of war is indescribable. And no matter what words I try to describe, the feeling of helplessness still sticks around me. I’m just opening and closing my mouth in my bed.

I’m against war. Is it meaningless to say?

On 26th of February, I joined a protest against the invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s Russian troops. No, it was more like I was just standing and listening to the urgency of the speeches of the Ukraine people rather than participating .

“ I came to the protest for the first time otherwise I just crying in my home.”  A old Japanese lady who was waving a small Ukraine flag at the back of the crowd told me with her small voice. I replied I felt the same.

Is this little flag waving by the lady meaningless? I kept thinking.

Although the speech ended, my reality of living in Japan in 2022 had nowhere to go and was floating.

Some faces I knew remained at the scramble intersection in Shibuya, perhaps they had the same feelings as me.

There we had dialogue not just sharing the information.

I’ve been to some protests , but I’ve never settled here well. It isn’t easy to get consensus between different people. In the protest hosted by Ukraine people on 26th of February, there was a flyer posted on the statue of Hachiko by someone saying “Kill Putin” under the flyer of “No war”.

I closed my eyes from the contradiction. The enthusiasm is always close to danger no matter how beautiful it sounds and this is why I’ve never fit in protests.

Still, protests create new possibilities by meeting people. Going out to the city, meeting people with your own voice and feelings have huge potential that goes beyond imagination. In fact, this NO WAR 0305 action started from the day of 26th by seeing friends at the protest.

Meeting people opens up infinite new possibilities. Therefore, I believe that it is meaningful to create a place to gather, even if it is under the pandemic. There is no difference from the Zenkankakusai (The music festival that Mahito has been hosting for over 10 years) that I personally cherished.

One of my Ukraine friends complained to me, “ Everyone has sympathy for Ukraine but they don’t really take action.”

In this NO WAR 0305protest, I would like to ask you to donate to the war victims and refugee support organizations.

To take a break, I stopped writing and sat down on the bench in a park nearby. Open a can coffee and took a deep breath.

Two kids playing with a ball in front of me. When I was looking at them, my nose became muffled. The scent of spring goes through my mask.

There must be a park like this in Ukraine. The museum you went on the first date, ordinary way back from school, favorite view of the city from the bus stop and the grave where ancestors sleep quietly. Every destroyed building had its own original memories.

There must have been scenery like what I’m seeing in Ukraine.

Now people in Ukraine are suffocating on the platform of the subway, the scene keeps destroying one after another, and the seasons slowly move over.

It’s hard to believe that more than 2000 Ukraine citizens died, how many spirits and scenery are gone.

And among the 6000 Russian soldiers who reported to die, there would be people like the children playing in this park.

Where the tears from partners and friends can be dropped. People who play guitar like me are now forced to hold guns.

Imagine the song they wanted to sing.

Music evokes the scent of life which is replaced by the number of the people who have died.

Music reminds us of the temperatures of the people which have been referred to as Russia and Ukraine.

I want to have the outline of hatred of war which robbed them of being able to go out and the joy of meeting people.

The war situation changes day by day and it became more and more complicated.

People in Ukraine are gathering together to fight despite the overwhelming difference in the strength of armed forces. But is there any reason why people really have to kill people in the first place?

What is the feeling of leaving your hometown and passing through the burning houses, straddling the place of soot-painted memories?

I heard the report that Russian soldiers who were much younger than me entered the battlefield despite being told to be training.

An unthinkable domineering runs through.

A Russian friend who came to an anti-war protest here is full of Ukraine flags. A Russian friend who can’t send money to their parents in their homeland because the bank is suspended. A Russian friend in Paris whose visa is going to expire in 2weeks and will be forced to join the army soon after he goes back to Russia.

Complex divisions that can’t be easily stated are confused in front of me however, what is certain is I am AGAINST WAR. This is an overwhelming evil that hasn’t changed.

What I want is not enthusiasm but the NO WAR that arrived to you through your real feelings. And I want to acknowledge that it certainly makes sense to put it into words.

Shinjuku on 5th of March, I want ask you to bring the NO WAR placard with you. Doesn’t matter if the paintings are good or bad, respect each other’s expressions. I don’t think this anti-war protest can capture the feelings of everyone in the complex layers. On the day of the event, there will be protests organized by Ukrainians at different locations and perspectives. I think it’s healthy for each person to choose for themselves where to belong.

As with the protests that are taking place all over the world, it is meaningful for people to get together for being against the war.

The message that we care about you in a difficult position due to this invasion is connected like a morning relay all over the world and has a not-so-small meaning.

Difficult situations such as Covid-19 are still continuing. If you want this rally to run to the end, please wear a mask and not be too dense, bring your imagination. And at the protest, please listen to the staff’s guidance and do not step on the Braille block. If anyone is in trouble, help the staff or the participants. I want you to be considerate. Because everyone is the party who lives in this sad situation. This is my heartfelt request.

When the feeling of helplessness that was letting you play alone in the room begins to have a temperature, imagine people who are still living in a difficult situation at this moment.

Those who fled Ukraine and became refugees. Those imprisoned for being anti-war under Putin’s administration, those with minorities who are even more at stake in this situation, power should be used to support them.

Don’t waste our energies to sneer, scrutinize discussions and encourage division.

Act means a lot even if it feels like a small voice or small amount of donation.

Imagine what is happening now, not captured as a subject of distant country, but as a human being who lives as we do.

Everyone should  think by themselves about what can be called justice and choose what you believe.

On the 5th of March, I wonder if the old lady is going to come?

It’s a crazy period but you and I still exist.

Let’s prove we are still alive.

I've never posted on here, but I'm currently going through a major loss of a family member to suicide, and it's impacting me and my family much harder than we could have ever anticipated. Music has always been a medicine for my soul in many dark times, and I'm finding myself listening to 'Skeleton Tree' and 'Ghosteen' by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. Both those albums tackle grief in different manners, and I find them strangely comforting as I'm going through this pain; Nick Cave articulates that heartache so poetically it makes me cry.  A friend of mine also recommended I listen to 'A Crow Looked At Me' (which I have heard before) and I will probably do that, though I'm a bit hesitant to revisit it since that album was absolutely soul-crushing.

Even though the lyrics are abstract, it is quite easy to make the link between them and the Cold War ongoing at the time.

The recent passing of Ian McDonald as well as the current geopolitical situation has made this song even more relevant nowadays.  
If there are any musicians out there, would you be interested in doing a cover online ? (Recording yourself and editing all the pieces together).

The more people there are, the better it will be ! If you play any of those instruments (or any other) and are interested, please leave a comment !

Anyway, I fall in love with their music and I got curious ""hey, how did I find them?"". Since I never delete browser history, found the reference pretty easily and the reference got nothing to do with music. I was reading about Japan on a social media site that is very popular on my country. Someone wrote ""this country has amazing young musicians band.. here's an example"" and I clicked.

Another example is that I didn't know anything about EDM until a friend send me [David August's Boiler Room Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfwdJx0NDE). I didn't know about an entire music culture! What if I died without knowing what EDM is?? That's terrifying.

t704bp,The Weather Station Plateaus On How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars - Album Review,discussion,3,0.72,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/t704bp/the_weather_station_plateaus_on_how_is_it_that_i/,0,"On the cover of last year’s *Ignorance*, The Weather Station’s Tamara Lindeman was pictured cradled by foliage as lush as the production backing her. It was, foremostly, a way to illustrate her burgeoning activism and concern for the climate crisis - her muse for the album, but also a neat representation of how she had learned to become the center of attention in a full band. She stands even taller on the cover of *How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars*, Lindeman’s sixth album, catching the golden hues of sunlight on her head. This is her moment. But as Lindeman’s transformation from shuddered introvert to casually confident leader enters its final stages on this companion record, the band she’s supposed to instruct loses purpose. 

Though these hushed conditions are familiar to The Weather Station, Lindeman has since reinvented herself in fuller scenery, and in the transition away from *Ignorance*’s panoramic design details are lost. Now percussionless, these songs are largely anchored by a piano, a substitution that adds very little to Lindeman’s already tender falsetto. If anything, the monotonous throbbing of keys is an intrusion to the utopia Lindeman forges on *Endless Time*. *“We could walk out on the street and buy roses from Spain/Lemons and persimmons in December rain”*, she sings while curling her voice around the stationary melody. Elsewhere, Lindeman treats this passiveness as a way to make astute juxtapositions. It is only when the instrumental is cut on *Stars* that she condenses adoration and grief into a thesis for this double-album era, *“I swear to god this world will break my heart”*. 

Lines like these just go to show how effective her writing revisions have been. All Lindeman really needs to elicit an emotional reaction is a few syllables. *Taught* even begins with its climax, *“In another life/I might trust you/In the way I cannot in this one”*. Another two and half minutes follow that bombshell, which is, of course, delivered tranquilly, but Lindeman reveals the velvety barb early so her disappointment may stew. There’s an almost pedantic method to Lindeman’s storytelling. She blows static words up into a lucid world in a way that only Phoebe Bridgers has done better in recent years. Lindeman’s personal narrative is so closely connected to mundane symbols that it's hard not to see her as an everywoman who’s found global recognition by accident. When she opens *Marsh* with her most defeating diction, *“The year was unrelenting/We argued all the time/I obliterate your positions/And you know just how to obliterate mine”*, it feels like the album might just stop then and there.  

What is most impressive about the way Lindeman perseveres, though, is that her confidence begins to outweigh her concern. Without substantial support, Lindeman finds new ways to fill these songs, twisting her voice and dressing it with perks accordingly. The taunting call of a magpie manifests itself as the wrath of nature on *Ignorance.* It reaches out to Lindeman like a nightmare she can no longer repress, and yet, her voice roves without weight much like Joni Mitchell. On *Song*, Lindeman extends a phrase into a wordless melody that hovers atop a quivering synth mimicking the kinetic vibration of water. It is one of the few moments where the band exits auto-pilot to help build an experience so life-like you could sink into it. 

It’s reported that the album was conceived in the same window Lindeman was creating, and prioritizing *Ignorance*. You can tell. Not because it bears hand-me-down marks, it doesn’t. *How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars* could very easily survive in its own canon had it been treated with equal care to its predecessor, though. *Sleight Of Hand* meanders aimlessly like a child in the television section of an electronics store, and *To Talk About* invites the tepid vocals of keyboardist Ryan Driver into the fray to sing of the laziness of singing about love whilst singing of love. Yes, it really is that confusing. The unnurtured final product means Lindeman retreads the unspecific song structures just to meet a minimum quota for it to be considered a ‘proper’ album. 

This is the issue with *How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars*: Lindeman’s world has gotten smaller and so too has the music. No longer is she turning kempt assertions that have been pent-up for a lifetime into a harsh wake-up call to listeners. That’s too much, she’s in love for christ's sake! The generously fluid backdrop that sported a sprinkle of sax here, and a sweeping string movement there, has also been downsized to match the refurbished goals of this sister record. This was the way of The Weather Station a decade ago, but who could have guessed that it would be how Lindeman followed the biggest and bravest departure from her roots?

t6s6sg,What do you guys consider “classic rock?”,discussion,12,0.82,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/t6s6sg/what_do_you_guys_consider_classic_rock/,82,"Had a bit of a shower thought today. Random question and pointlessly long post incoming. (Sorry if this has been discussed before). 

My childhood is 90’s-early 2000’s and like many, my love of classic rock came from listening to classic rock stations that my dad always had on in the car, in the garage etc. 

I came to associate particular artists in that genre, the usual suspects… Beatles, the Stones, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, Dire Straights, AC/DC, Cheap Trick, Foreigner … usually extending up to some 80’s hair bands I.e White Snake, Def Leppard. 

That defines my conception of classic rock. But thinking back on it now that my perception of time is fucked up from getting older, I recognise that an album like “Rumours” was only 20-25 years old during my childhood listening to those songs on classic rock station. In today’s terms, that takes us back to early 2000’s era. I would never consider, for example, The Strokes, or the Killers “classic rock.” For that matter, I would never have Nirvana on my classic rock playlist because it just doesn’t fit my conception of that genre even tho they are 30+ years old. 

Do you guys conceive of “classic rock” as being defined by time frame (i.e 25+ years old), or do you consider it a particular grouping of artists from the 60’s-80’s like I do?",1646425877.0

mixing and mastering your song: • Corrective EQ
Harmonic Saturation Processing • Multi-Band
Compression • Reverb • Delay • Stereo Imaging
Autotune (if needed) • Creative FX
Also, NO PRESETS ARE USED
If anything else is requested directly I can also
implement this and if I think something is needed for
your song I'll add it too!
What I need to get started mixing & mastering your
song: •Your stems in WAV/ AIFF/MP3 •A rough demo of
your song before I can take the project.
Thanks for reading and I look forward to working with
you!",1646472370.0

t6m7md,"People you should know, but might not know: David Allan Coe",discussion,11,0.68,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/t6m7md/people_you_should_know_but_might_not_know_david/,54,"Who is he: David Allan Coe is the Outlaw Country singer/songwriter that was too outlaw for outlaws.

Why should I care?: The man is 82 and continue to tour today. In his long career he wrote some of the most offensive country music to grace air waves, and also some of the most classic and beautiful country music to grace airwaves. He lived an incredibly fascinating life but do to his controversial (to put it lightly) personality is not given the due that other outlaw country greats like Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Merle Haggard are given.

So what’s the story: Mr. Coe was born in the Deep South in 1939. Spent the majority of his young life in and out of juvenile halls and prison. Allegedly killed a man at one point. Got discovered by busking outside the grand ol opry. Wrote legendary songs that I’ll list later. Got married to multiple wives, had several children, got divorced. Wrote infamous songs. Hid from the law and government by living in caves for a few years. Got it together.  Recorded with a heavy metal band (Pantera bros). Probably did some outlaw motorcycle gang stuff in there somewhere. You could and should make a movie.

Selected Listening (The Safe): wrote “Take this Job and Shove it”,  “You never even Call me by my Name”, “Tennessee Whiskey”, “Field of Stone”, “Jack Daniels if you Please”, Long Haired Outlaw”, “If that ain’t country”, and then the list goes on and on.

Selected Listening (The Very Not Safe TRIGGER WARNING): “F*** Anita Bryant”, “C** Stains on the Pillow”, “Pick em, Lick em, and Stick em”, “Ain’t Nothing Sacred Anymore?”, “Lay Me down some Rails”

OP personal recommendations: “Spotlight”, “Revenge”, “Living on the Run”, and for my money the greatest country song of all time: “Piece of Wood and Steel”

Is the artist a “good dude”: Hmm, he’s definitely done, said, and sang things that some people will find unforgivable. This is man who was raised by the prison system of pre-segregation and Jim Crow era Deep South. Clearly was not a good dude for much of his early life. On the flip side he’s since recanted his explicit stuff-he doesn’t sell it or profit from it anymore. You can’t get it on Spotify, his website, or at a merch booth (so I’ve been told). Those albums were intentionally made to bomb because in a divorce settlement his wife won a portion of the sales (so I’ve heard). He’s generally polite in interviews. He’s denied being racist, chauventist, or homophobic. I think he would treat fans right if approached. My verdict is he’s a good guy with some deep flaws, and definitely a product of a time and place long since past. You decide for yourself.",1646409734.0

I bought 2 tickets for Silk Sonic’s Saturday (3/5) show in Vegas a while back through TM. Got called for weekend work about a month ago for that same weekend, and listed them on Stubhub as Mobile Transfer tickets (ticketmaster wouldn't allow me to sell them on their site).

Early  this week, I received them in the mail as physical tickets (which I  didn't think they would be). I knew I had to change them to physical  tickets on Stubhub, but someone purchased them yesterday (Thursday) as  the original mobile transfer tickets. Since the person bought the  tickets so close to the show, I have to sell them as mobile transfer/PDF  tickets (Stubhub won't allow me to change it to physical).

I  reached out to TM asap about switching over the tickets from physical  to Mobile Transfer. No response on their phone line, and the email line  only gets me automated responses. I call StubHub, and they tell me I  will get charged the full price if I can't provide the tickets as mobile  transfer. Stuck in a Catch-22 with these physical tickets.

Not  only will I be losing the full value of the tickets from Ticketmaster,  but will be charged an extra $300 with Stubhub. Does anyone know if  there's a way to save this situation? Or am I just screwed??",1646422102.0

The best way for me to describe the style is:

Incessant, chugging guitar, often straight 8ths or 16ths ""NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH"" is the best way to describe it. Very in your face

A sort of half singing, half speaking style, it's quite a distinct type of singing voice regardless of the band

A lot of enthusiasm, although this often unfortunately doesnt seem to be backed by talent

I've been spending the last few days reorganizing some of my MP3 catalog, and I came across some MP3 files that came into my possession in the early days of MP3 distribution. (1999, to be exact)

The songs are from a band called SOULPUSHER (all caps) and the song titles are ""Warsong"" and ""Love is Strange.""

The metadata is long since garbled by some applications I ran a decade ago to try and clean up the tags, ironically. The application tried to connect those songs to albums that exist, and so misidentified the album names and the original artists. Basically, the only information that remained intact are the band name and tracks which I took from the original file names.

The band probably was an indie band, as there is no trace of them on Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, or any other service I searched. The songs are beautiful, soulful alt-rock ballads sung by a late 90s aunjanue-ish woman accompanied by a guitar with a slow rock beat.

I know this is not a lot to go on, but I am still hoping someone out there has heard of this group, or can point me in the right direction. It's hard to believe that they have just disappeared from music history.

Harmonic Saturation Processing • Multi-Band
Compression • Reverb • Delay • Stereo Imaging
Autotune (if needed) • Creative FX
Also, NO PRESETS ARE USED
If anything else is requested directly I can also
implement this and if I think something is needed for
your song I'll add it too!
What I need to get started mixing & mastering your

Who was he: Chuck Schuldiner was the creative mind, vocalist, and guitarist for a Heavy Metal project called Death. 

Why should you care: While the first couple albums are the usual gore oriented death metal affair, they are among the first of their kind. Later albums would be more progressive musically and lyrically shifting topics from horror movie stuff to deeper questions about life and philosophy. Every album contains musicianship of the highest caliber. 

Was this artist a “good dude”: Yes, Chuck was a extremely kind soul off the stage. He was a courteous interview, easy to work with by all accounts, and an animal lover. 

Selected Listenings: If you like Cannibal Corpse, Autopsy, and Obituary. Those bands drew heavily on the first two Death albums. If you want something more thought provoking start with “Symbolic” and proceed through “The Sound of Perseverance”. If clean vocals are a must, Chuck was working on a clean project called Control Denied, but passed before he could finish it. There are a couple of recordings that were pieced together post mortem that are easily available on the internet. 

Disclaimer: if I made mistakes here I’m sure the comments section will point them out. I’ve done my best and my hope is that the artist reaches the ears of people that might have otherwise overlooked it.

Based on other’s responses to AMEX questions, my personal experience purchasing AMEX  pre-sale tickets, and Ticketmaster Q&A this is MOST likely the way you will be able to gain access:

—If asked for a code - Enter the 10 digit “customer service” number on the back of your card. You must pay with an AMEX card.

-If Ticketmaster asks if you are an AMEX cardholder - Click on “yes” and you should have access. You must pay with an AMEX card.

Some Q&A I’ve seen on posts and comments:

-Can you use any AMEX card? - Yes, any AMEX card gives you access to the pre-sale.

-Can I apply for an AMEX and instantly receive my credit card number - Yes, most AMEX cards give you instant access to your credit card number and allows you to make purchases instantly upon approval even before receiving the physical card.

-Which AMEX card should I apply for? - If you’d like to apply to the Delta AMEX Platinum card - http://refer.amex.us/JESSIMSdla?XL=MIMCP - WARNING, there is a $250 annual fee, but has great travel benefits that pay off the fee and more (if used responsibly).

If this is the first video in this series you've seen, I am posting a lesson for EVERY song on the *Police Greatest Hits compilation album*.

In this video you'll learn how to play **""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic""** as recorded by the Police on guitar.

After filming this lesson and working this song out from the recording, wow all I have to say is that I think this might be one of the greatest songs I have ever covered on my channel or online.

Now I was recently watching a Sting interview on YouTube and they got to talking about this song. Dominic James Miller, Sting's current guitar player, was in the interview and had commented that he was **never really quite sure about how to approach this song on guitar.**

If he feels that way, imagine how the rest of us feel trying to play it! I also think this might be why **no big guitar instructor on YouTube has covered it.**

In this video I'll take you through a guitar part for the entire song!

I used to use a website called FunkyReleases, part of a larger forum by a similar name, to find out both what albums were coming out in the future and what albums came out in the past.

It was great because it very clearly showed the band, album name, what genres they fell under, and their publishing label. It was incredibly useful and very easy to use.

Unfortunately, they've gone down recently, possibly permanently, since their servers are based out of Ukraine and we all know what's happening over there right now.

Anyway, I'm stuck scrambling for an alternative and I can't find anything that remotely works. The best I've seen so far are release calendars on Genius that, while comprehensive, still don't indicate what genre an artist is or what label they're releasing from.

I tend to listen to all forms of rock, if that helps. That includes everything from soft rock to hard rock to metal to industrial to punk to hardcore to... anyway, if it can fall under rock I'll probably give it a try is what I'm saying.

There are sites here and there that delve heavily into a particular rock genre, but none that really move the needle in general, which makes it difficult if, for example, I want to find post-grunge or alternative metal releases from other countries.

Does anyone have anything in particular that they use to keep track of things? I realize this is probably a lost cause; FunkyReleases was really something special, and it's bonkers to me that in today's day and age there isn't an easy resource for this kind of information.",1646321375.0
