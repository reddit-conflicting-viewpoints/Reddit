Then MTV was like, what if we had an acoustic-only concert with rock and grunge bands. It was new and cool. Plus it led to a lot of awesome songs on the best albums from the time. Acoustic usually isn't really a cool instrument, but MTV made it cool for a while.

sp5plr,hwemfjs,t1_hwdpjw2,"I came here to say this.  There are plenty of artists who should absolutely do an Unplugged performance, but many of them are older, more established artists.  What made Unplugged interesting in its heyday was that we were coming out the 80s with a synth sound and moving to an alternative ""grunge"" sound and so the artists performing, by and large, were giving a very different sounding performance of their hits.  Sure we had performances from artists who could perform acoustically in their sleep, but ""Layla"" certainly sounds different than it does on an electric guitar in its original rendition. 

The next layer of what made it so great is that the performances we consider iconic today: Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains all proved that they really did have the musical chops and ability to perform.  I don't think The Ramones would have sounded good unplugged, but that generation of talent who was inspired by punk rock DID.  

Many of today's ""relevant"" younger artists couldn't perform in this setting.  Again, there's plenty of exceptions, but who do you know today who sounds unlike anything that came before them, could play a setlist that's almost a third covers of songs few people know, and leave the remainder of their setlist devoid of their biggest hits be regarded as one of the best live performances of all time?",-1,0,1,0,-1,False,False,False,1644520664.0

Having said that, we had **THE BEST** time at Dollywood.  We went with a certain prejudiced and preconceived notion of what it would be like.   While my kids didn't understand why so many people were riding mobility scooters and were a little shocked at how much larger the people were .... yes, there are big people everywhere, but the proportion of big people to not so big people was very high.

""I live 1 1/2 hours away.  If I go home, I'm not coming back.""

They paid horribly, exploited legal loopholes to avoid overtime, and worked employees to the bone.  That job absolutely sucked.  They used to supplement the workforce with international workers they could more easily exploit in addition to the college employees like us and some of the local high school employees too.

If you do listen to it then you should really pay attention to the transitions *(oh my god the transitions are so beautiful)*, every song transitions into the next in an eargasmic way - its almost like the entire album was made on one track and then split into different songs because of how the songs flow so incredibly well into eachother.

spa6uj,hwf3wv2,t3_spa6uj,"I have two that are probably my favorite albums of all time:

The Weeknd - House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence

House of balloons is about a guy's descent into depression and him losing himself to his drugs and ruining his relationship by being unfaithful. Thursday is the same guy with a different girl. This album is much more about the girl than it is the guy (not to spoil it but thursday gets really fucked up). Echoes of Silence is him fully embracing his drug-induced party animal lifestyle until the end of the album where he's alone and feels like he can't escape the hole he's dug himself in. Even though the protagonist of these albums is absolutely the villian, it's still emotionally devastating.

Alice in chains - jar of flies

This album is about addiction. It opens with the protag doing drugs for the first time or ""eating from the apple"" as the song says. The addiction stays with him until he's very old, the song ""don't follow"" being a warning to a young person, warning that drugs will ruin their life.

Here are lyrics from ""Right Ahead, Young Sailor"" where he is talking to the captain of the ship.


Oh sweet anna did you mean to do this to me
Ive been trying hard to be rational

What a woman, what a woe that you give to me
How long can i count to a thousand

I tried drinking but the bottle is still empty
I can only hope for a fresh one

You tried loving but i guess you could not love me
How long can you count to a thousand

I could be the bigger man, bigger man.
Yeah i could be the bigger man, bigger man.
But i just want to kill a man kill a man
Really what's a bigger man?

Oh young sailor do see you what your captain sees?
Love is nothing more than an action

What an ocean, what a world, on the big blue seas
You can change it all if you want to

My good leader what a self loving web you weave
I have got a son and a daughter

My young sailor what a point that you just can't see
Don't you think that they need a father

So pull yourself together man, smaller man
And do it for a bigger man, bigger man

Arcade Fire’s “The Suburbs” is a perfect example of this (or “Neon Bible”, or “Everything Now”, or “Funeral” haha).

The only verse that's supposed to have high energy is the third, when he's singing about the performance, which is immediately countered by the last part of the verse being soft as he switches to singing about laying in bed. Listen to the original. It starts with a lonely saxophone, then the voice comes in and stays meek through the first verse and chorus. The drums don't come in until the start of the second voice and even then, they are light and Seger is careful not to ramp up the vocals too much. The mood still matches the story being told. 

Now listen to the Metallica version. The drums come in halfway through the first verse because Lars can't wait and when he starts to play, it's so loud that James has to sing over the top. It immediately raises the energy of the song, ruining the feeling of what is being told. In other words, the sound doesn't match the story. Then James starts with his patented strain / gravel in the first chorus, further ruining the mood. It doesn't make any sense to the song. 

James isn't a good vocalist and frankly they should have avoided this cover. Their covers of more obscure stuff are fantastic. I have to think they chose *Turn The Page* because they knew it would get them in the radio often.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644533035.0

soxuce,hwd4bhm,t3_soxuce,"These albums:

Deep Purple - “Machine Head” or “Made in Japan”. Jon Lord kills, and a B3 through a Marshall is a sick, sick sound. 

Emerson, Lake and Palmer, - “Trilogy” or “Brain Salad Surgery”. What can you say, Emerson is so great. 

UK - “Danger Money”. Eddie Jobson deserves more recognition, he’s a killer keyboardist, and on this album, they are a trio (Jobson, the amazing Terry Bozzio on drums and John Wetton). Their self titled album is also great, with Allan Holdsworth on guitar, but Danger Money is an organ forward album. 

Boston - “Boston” (the first album). Really good B3 playing here by Tom Scholz. 

Yes - “Fragile”, “Yessongs (live)”. Rick Wakeman, “Roundabout”, what more needs to be said?

Kansas - “Point of Know Return” - Steve Walsh is a great singer and organist. This record is really inspired, although I personally don’t like “Dust in the Wind”…

Gentle Giant - “Free Hand”. Kerry Minnear is a great keyboardist, and Gentle Giant is an amazing band. They make a lot of progressive bands look a little tame, to be honest, they can get really complex, but if you like prog and never heard them, well, you are in for a treat, and this album is a good entry point. 

Spock’s Beard - “Kindness of Strangers”, really any of their many albums. Millennial prog, with the great Ryo Okumoto on keyboards. Steve Morse was their lead Vocalist and main songwriter up to the “Snow” album (caution, very thinly veiled allegorical Jesus lyrics on that one), but their post-Morse work is also really good.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644499923.0

You can record something on your phone and still ""live in the moment"". Its super weird to imply that anyone filming something on their phone is mentally detached from reality and their only way to recall the night is through \~3 min of phone footage. Its also weird to think that people only take the video to post online for bragging rights or whatever. Cheering on artists that have ""no phone policies"" is weird for many reasons if you think for just a few minutes about what the implications of that are outside of people holding up their phone for a couple minutes.

I think this reaction is way overexaggerated. I've been to a lot of concerts in the few years before covid cancelled all live music, and never saw anyone holding up their phone for the entirety of a show. I've never seen anyone whip out the iPad to obscure anyone's view, the biggest device I saw was somebody hold up a 3DS to take a picture, but it was obviously a joke and everyone around had a good laugh about it.

Personally when I go to shows, I record maybe two or three of my favorite songs, and hold my phone at chest height or just below my eyeline (6'4"" so I'm already blocking somebodies view). Just point it in the general direction of whoever is the most interesting on stage, If I get it I get it, if not I still have the audio, which looks and sounds pretty decent on a modern phone. Even while recording I still have situational awareness for when a crowd surfer is coming my way I can help keep them up. And I am glad I took those videos, because for over a year, I didn't have anything and it was comforting to be able to go back and relive those moments.

sny5vi,hw6rhof,t3_sny5vi,"Coming from a working musician's perspective, most people don't realize how influential the audience is to the energy of the show. An audience who's parked on their phones filming is not engaged like an audience living in the moment and responding to the stage. When the band and the audience are on the same wavelength and firing on all cylinders, there is an electric energy to the room that cannot be achieved any other way. Once you experience it once (from either the audience or the stage side, but especially from the stage side), you try to get it back every show. It is live music at its absolute best.

At the end of the day, not every show (regardless of the artist) can be like that. It's a special occurrence. I've personally never had it happen in a massive stadium...an absolutely packed club where the audience is right up to the end of the stage is the best place for it. But regardless of the venue, passively watching the concert through your phone screen does not contribute to that energy. Being a good audience is an ACTIVE experience. Obviously the band has to be good for that to happen, but if you're going to see \[insert favorite popular artist here\] one would assume they will be.

I don't really need ""phone free""...there's nothing wrong with taking a picture or filming a couple clips. We all want to get some record for posterity, and/or show our friends we're at a killer show. But just parking up to film the whole song or show is a different thing entirely.

The costs could cover/pay a lot of people, more than cover licensing, and would definitely give me better memories than some bullshit blurred blown out from lighting fx shaky cam pic from 70ft in the crowd.

The issue I see isn’t peoples phones, it’s people wanting to capture that moment for themselves but it gets in the way of everyone else behind them.  This seems like a modest solution for me.  No cameras, no flashlights, no excuses.

edit; also this cuts out a good portion of the bootleg concert film market.  Sure someone will put it on the internet, but I’d rather have the physical media for myself…maybe personalized.

Breaking Benjamin is my personal favorite band (heavy and melodic with some screams here and there and great lyrics) ""Failure"" is a good place to start 

Evanescence (one of the bigger bands of the 2000's, hauntingly beautiful vocals with dark rock) you probably know their song ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Sweet Sacrifice"" is great too

Saint Asonia (a new-ish band with an excellent singer that is just overall a great band) ""Better Place"" is a good one to start with

Halestorm (another amazing singer with really fun energy filled songs) ""Freak Like Me"" is sooo addictive and the bridge blows everyone away 

Nightwish (has had 3 singers, has great storytelling lyrics and epic instrumentals) literally anything from live at Wacken 2013 is great 

Jinjer ( im not even gonna comment on the style of this band, just check out ""Pisces"" and prepare to be blown away) 

Icon For Hire (uplifting lyrics, with more pop punk instrumentals with a little pop and rap here and there) ""Make a Move"" is their biggest song, but ""Curse or Cure"" is one off their newer album that is also really good.

sp1esg,hwdr5m7,t3_sp1esg,"In general it's difficult to make a good living in music. A few people do; most lose weight. If you aspire to do this, be ready to have multiple revenue streams--performing, composing, giving lessons, playing wedding gigs, working in a music shop, waiting tables, etc.--and have a back-up plan in mind. A common suggestion for a back-up plan is to get a music education degree, so that you can teach music at a high-school level to survive while trying to establish yourself writing music. I wish I could be more upbeat, but it will be difficult to make a living in composition, especially if you're self-taught.

**Edit** Also: Be practical! If you're hard-stuck on ""art for art's sake, no compromise,"" then heaven help you. Don't turn up your nose at writing music you don't personally like, e.g., for video games, TV commercials, etc.

Also also: Learn the business side of music. Know how contracts, copyrights, and royalties work. It does you little good to write a hit song if you've sold all rights to someone else for peanuts. OTOH, if someone contracts you for work for hire, you probably got paid a flat rate and they probably own it. IANAL.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644509242.0

sose13,hwby7m1,t3_sose13,"I'd like to say that music has changed my life, but it has always been a part of my life.

When I was little, my parents listened to classical music, big band, and musicals.  When I was 10, I got my own AM radio, and started listening to rock & roll and pop music.  A couple years later my brother and I got an FM radio, and stayed up late listening to ""album rock"" radio.


Then I found out that the people who were playing the records on the radio actually did that for a living.  ""Wait...that's a job?!""  So I went to college and studied broadcasting, but really...the point of earning a degree in broadcasting was to get a job playing music on the radio.

It was 35 years from the moment I dropped the needle on that first record at the college radio station until i finally was laid off from my last radio job a few years ago.


It was jarring.  Not just to be unemployed and have to find a new job, but to find out for the first time that other people didn't have music around them at work.  The radio wasn't playing.  You couldn't listen to music at most of the jobs I've had since. If they caught you jamming out to a song on your headphones, you'd get in trouble.

The silence was deafening.  


I guess what I'm trying to say is that music never changed my life, because it was always there.  What really changed is that I realized how precious it was when I couldn't have music in my life while I was at work.  I started a new position on Monday where I can finally listen to music again.

There's no material of them in a studio before Bleach because they literally couldn't afford studio time. This was before you could record an album on a laptop. You needed to book studio time, and it was like $1000/hr plus the wages of the engineers/techs and the cost of all of the tapes.

The last studio I worked at was only $800 a day, not including an engineer or any assistant engineers, and they spent two million dollars on the building and equipment. If I did the session I charged $25 an hour, the guy above me charged $35. Clients were of course welcome to bring their own engineer, but most would choose to use one of us to assist because we knew the gear and the layout. So a full day of recording, like a 16 hour day, could easily come in under 2 grand. Also, if the studio wasn’t booked we were allowed to bring friends in to record for free, and it was up to us if we charged them for our time.

Artists have been asking for and/or demanding, depending on clout, higher and higher guarantees for shows for years. So promoters have had to find a way to not only cover that growing nut, but still make some money doing so.

Without even talking about arena and stadium acts for a minute, look at the parties involved in even a 3k cap room. Tickets are set at say $50, so it's a $150,000 show. Add $18 fees per ticket, now it's a $200k+ show. Even with TM skimming a little bit of that, the promoter basically has $50k more money to play with now. And this is without even getting into venues, promoters, and acts reselling their own tickets. Face value is often not market value once you get to a certain level of popularity. And everyone knows that, including acts' agents and management.

People hate thinking anyone besides some douchebag suit is getting their extra money, especially not their favorite artists, but why wouldn't these acts have good teams behind them figuring these things out with the douchebag suits?

sod8ux,hw8kcth,t3_sod8ux,"Having known the original Sound of Silence first and appreciating its thematic somber tone immensely, I did find Disturbed’s cover - while somber in some ways - kinda lacking in the original’s more deeply resonating approach and therein the feelings elicited from that sonic approach. 

Not to say I dislike it as much as some seem to, but it does sound flawed to me in a way where while I can appreciate aspects of the cover, as it all comes together, I don’t find it intriguing or captivating, especially in comparison to the original. I’m doubtful I can adequately describe how I feel towards both original and cover even in what detail I’ll go into, but I find the original to be like lightning in a bottle with everything coming together optimally to create something special and wondrous in tone and feeling, as opposed to Disturbed’s cover which seems for lack of a less critical word ‘contrived’ in how it seems very deliberate in its approach, but very safe and not very interesting in the specifics of its unique approach. And this is coming from someone who does appreciate bombast and other such over-the-top theatrics in rock and metal.

Though, while I doubt Disturbed would make music I’d ever be very interested in, I think I could appreciate and enjoy in passing if they made original music of theirs with a similar orchestral-backing and sometimes quiet-loud sort of template, with David’s vocals which I consider one of the more interesting and appreciable parts of the handful of Disturbed songs I’ve heard. Though a full album of orchestral quiet-loud sort of ballads would be far too one-dimensional I figure, so I would welcome more metal incorporated in a significant portion too, though my proposed idea may not be worth taking since, as I said, I doubt I would be part of the audience really engaged with this hypothetical approach from Disturbed for original music as I figure other bands I already like would hold my interest in the vein of epic kinds of rock/metal incorporating orchestral instruments/arrangements. But, I could at least appreciate them taking a crack at writing original material in this vein, and I suppose I could even like some of it here and there, but that’d definitely be a ‘I’ll know if/when it happens’ sort of deal, as while I have somewhat liked some of their music in the past, the music would have to be a lot more interesting than what I’ve heard from them to actually be listened to in full and/or more than once from me.

So I think not liking the cover much, for me, has to do with their approach just not melding with or complementing the parts of the original they kept in a way that made the original’s approach better (which I feel it wasn’t exactly trying for) or different which, while both having differences in approach as well as similarities, the cover’s approach just doesn’t do it for me. Lacking a lot of what made the original good, but not adding in an adequate replacement to live up to the original, but in a different way. Though the cover isn’t really bad in my opinion, I just feel like it falls a fair bit short of the original in how I like it.

Also, speaking of covers of songs Paul Simon has been involved in making, while I also don’t like this cover as much as the original, I do rather still like Hexvessel’s cover of “Diamonds (On the Soles of Her Shoes)” which Hexvessel just titles as “Diamonds”, but I like it’s specific psychedelic folk music approach as it’s a style I find interesting, and it’s quite different in an interesting way to me. Probably more different in sonic themes than Disturbed’s SOS is to S&G’s original, but an approach I personally like. Though still not as much as the original, but it’s a version I like enough to hear every now and then of my own accord.

i ended my wewationship wif nyu-metaw nyeawwy hawf my wife ago~ and it amazes me how many of uwu dese bands awe stiww togethew~ making teh same sounds~ 8+ awbums owo in. That scene is stiww~ evidentwy~ waking owo in cash and it's nyot showing signs of uwu stopping. Wooking at teh way cuwtuwe pewsists since teh mid-00s~ dis is sowt of uwu expected. Teh thing i wasn't expecting was that nyu-metaw wouwd become so mainstweam that it wouwd become mundane. Dis weads me uwu to teh impetus behind dis post:

i heawd distuwbed's covew of uwu ""sound of uwu siwence"" owo in teh gwocewy stowe teh othew day.
 
fiwst~ i nyeed uwu to addwess dis pawticuwaw covew of uwu dis pawticuwaw song. Something that absowutewy kiwws me is teh nyeed uwu to make evewything ""epic"" owo in dis day and age. Chu take a sewenye~ poignyant~ ambiguous pwotest song wike ""sound of uwu siwence"" and chu add distowtion~ a stwong buiwdup~ and david dwaiman's signyatuwe vocaws owo in some effowt uwu to make teh song have mowe oomph~ mowe powew~ uwu to give it a nyew wife ow intwoduce it uwu to a nyew genyewation. Owo in my opinyion~ distuwbed's ""sound of uwu siwence"" is powewfuw owo in teh way a 15-yeaw-owd wouwd think it is. Pewhaps teh onwy thing i can be happy about wegawding dis covew is that it may intwoduce teh owiginyaw ""sound of uwu siwence"" uwu to a nyew swath of uwu 15-yeaw-owds teh same way seeing watchmen owo in theatews intwoduced it uwu to me.
 
anyone who's wistened uwu to bob dywan~ simon & gawfunkew~ ow any mtv unpwugged concewt knyows that~ sometimes~ stwipping a song down uwu to its bawe essentiaws bwings out uwu its beauty~ and makes it mowe powewfuw. ""sound of uwu siwence"" is a bwiwwiant song because of uwu its stawk instwumentation and its defiant~ pwophetic~ and despaiwing wywics. ""sound of uwu siwence"" is nyot supposed uwu to be epic. Distuwbed's covew is teh definyition of uwu ovewdoing it when it comes uwu to a song that's supposed uwu to be quiet~ haunting~ and foweboding. 
 
somehow~ dis covew has manyaged uwu to ecwipse aww of uwu distuwbed's discogwaphy. It's got mowe wistens than ""down wif teh sicknyess"" on spotify~ and is within stwiking distance of uwu having mowe wistens than teh owiginyaw ""sound of uwu siwence"". Cweawwy dis has stwuck a chowd cuwtuwawwy~ and it's actuawwy impwessive considewing teh song was weweased owo in 2015. Was it owo in some movie i didn't see uwu? was it pwayed at spowting events uwu? (i say dis because i saw a teenyagew figuwe skating uwu to it teh othew day owo in teh owympics.) ow was it pounded into mundanyity by cowpowate ovewwowds who decided it wouwd be wipe uwu to pway owo in gwocewy stowes uwu?

wet's tawk about gwocewy stowe music. It's impowtant uwu to wemembew that evewyone inside of uwu a gwocewy stowe is a captive audience uwu to teh cowpowate wadio that pways dewe (unwess dey have eawbuds owo in). Dewefowe~ teh assumption pwaced on dis music is that it nyeeds uwu to be agweeabwe music fur evewyone and anyone. Dewe's awso teh assumption that it wiww sewve as owo appwopwiate backgwound music (i.e. muzak) fur ur shopping. As owo a totaw music snyob~ i'd have uwu to put dese among teh wowst assumptions uwu to be pwaced on a piece of uwu music. Any awtist wouwd ask that theiw music be paid attention uwu to~ and even judged~ wegawdwess of uwu teh hatews. But owo in a gwocewy stowe~ chu can't tuwn it off~ and chu can't tuwn it woudew. Chu instead have uwu to accept that teh music wiww become a pawt of uwu teh stowe's pwedictabwe~ expected~ mundane ambiance.
 
i don't knyow how ewse uwu to say dis: if i deepwy wespect chu as owo an awtist ow a band~ den i most wikewy don't want uwu to heaw chu owo in a stowe as owo agweeabwe~ mundane backgwound nyoise. Dis isn't uwu to dispawage soft wockews wike john mayew~ ow twacy chapman~ ow even kenny g. Dey obviouswy didn't choose uwu to have theiw music contextuawized owo in dis way. Stiww though~ when i heaw a song i wike owo in a gwocewy stowe~ i can't hewp but think ""you desewve bettew than dis."" 

uwu to wap up~ when i heawd distuwbed's ""sound of uwu siwence"" owo in teh gwocewy stowe a bunch of uwu thoughts went thwough my head:

1. Wow~ hewe owo in teh yeaw of uwu ouw wowd 2022~ i've officiawwy heawd distuwbed owo in a gwocewy stowe.
 2. I fowgot dis covew existed. I wemembew when distuwbed did that genyesis covew aww dose yeaws ago and peopwe wewe confused and ambivawent and i didn't even knyow it was a covew untiw wike a yeaw watew. That's pwobabwy happenying again wight nyow.
 3. ""sound of uwu siwence"" is such a beautifuw song and dis is such a shitty tweatment of uwu it.
 4. Does anyone ewse see teh iwony owo in a song that's about peopwe nyot communyicating being pwayed owo in a gwocewy stowe whewe peopwe bwush by each othew avoiding eye contact uwu? nyo uwu? just me uwu?
5. Nyu-metaw has cwossed teh wine fwom being teh bumpew music fur twaditionyawwy mascuwine fowms of uwu content wike bwacksmithing videos and ufc fights~ uwu to being agweeabwe~ gwocewy stowe-gwade muzak.
 6. Dis is a weaw step up owo in intensity fwom twaditionyaw gwocewy stowe soft wock. Teh vamp-up at teh wattew end of uwu teh covew is simpwy on a diffewent dynyamic wevew~ and it's stwange uwu to heaw it whiwe i'm wooking at toiwet papew.
 7. God i fluffing hate dis covew~ and i can't tuwn it off. 
 8. It'ww pwobabwy pway teh nyext time i'm hewe.

I felt the intensity in the song myself and performed it before I heard it from Disturbed.

My Dad hates the Disturbed version, and he doesn’t hate all covers- he loved Leonard Cohen for decades before he heard Jeff Buckley’s Hallelujah and loved that, too. 

The grocery store sucks no matter what, I agree about the irony of the song message playing through a grocery store speakers.  It’s even funnier to me that it’s the Disturbed version, like they predicted the irony and recorded the song for that reason lol.

I appreciate Disturbed’s version in that context — it sounds like neither the original or like most of the rest of their music. 

With that being said… I’m not a fan of their version. The obnoxiously obvious pitch correction juxtaposed with the grandiose emotional arrangement makes the whole song feel super contrived imo

It’s also annoying because David Draiman is a talented singer who surely was capable of recording a vocal track that didn’t need auto-tune. Idk, it just seems like they lazily said “eh this take is good enough” and called it a day.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644490669.0

sod8ux,hw8tiu1,t1_hw8n7ub,"Thanks, and yeah, I’m doubtful I’d seek out hearing new music from Disturbed either. Rather since in previous years I’ve heard some of their music via old-ish (10-15 years ago) pop-culture like the Guitar Hero/Rock Band video games, and I’ve been involved in some online music communities where people play songs via youtube or other sources for the group together, that in my experience with said media and groups that Disturbed’s songs I’ve heard in settings like those generally were songs that were fine by me, albeit only some songs had somewhat interesting parts, so I wanted to temper my criticism with an admission that there are aspects of their music which I can sorta understand the appeal of, albeit I don’t like it enough to prefer to listen to it over anything else I can think of when choosing what to hear is up to me.

So, while I don’t entirely understand the appeal of Disturbed’s music as fans seem to apparently get more enjoyment from it than me, I can appreciate the subjectivity involved, and even relate in how some music I really like is also seen as mundane and tired by some.

Not sure how popular this opinion is as I’ve only seen it a few times, but I’ve heard similar claims of finding this other band’s music boring and mundane. I’ll use them as an example as they’re a metal band that’s often incorporated symphonic elements, so kinda relevant in how they have some vague similarities to the cover song in this thread. The band is Therion and I think that they’ve mostly released good albums to me. (Only real dud of theirs to me (of the Therion albums I’ve heard) is the bloated Beloved Antichrist album, but I also haven’t heard the album that came between Theli and Vovin because of its reputation,) but I’ve seen others who find many of their albums boring or sub-par, even though I like the solid albeit not unique death metal of “Of Darkness”, the death metal + symphonic metal of “Beyond Sanctorum”, the more symphonic power/heavy metal approach of their later 90s and early 00s albums and so on, including last year’s album from Therion titled “Leviathan” which I recognize as not be experimentally groundbreaking, but is still a fun, epic, and largely engaging album to me. But as I’ve seen people who don’t care for them anymore or like one person who’s said they don’t see the appeal in any of Therion’s music, I can use as an example of having similar experience to those who like Disturbed and hear those who don’t. 

So I do think I can empathize in some ways with how Disturbed fans who like the cover and their other music, like something that others find uninteresting and bland. Not that I think this sort of experience is rare, but just using it more as a personal example of the subjective disconnect between those who like some music and those who may dislike it, or even not exactly dislike but just find it lacking or boring.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644425484.0

sobvsz,hw7s3qv,t3_sobvsz,"Are there any particular areas of music you mean specifically? 

The difference for me in this era of internet compared to the 90s is quantity. Back then if the artists were not signed to a label and getting commercial releases - you wouldn’t hear them. You had to get info on underground music from printed magazines or by going to record shops. 

Now many new artists get popular by themselves using the online space, way before any label eventually signs them. Also, listeners can have whichever niche music they want no matter how obscure or regional, delivered to them on a plate by simply typing some key words into a search engine. 

I think on the whole, this can only be a good thing. The argument now is that if you can’t find good music, you are just not looking hard enough. Because it’s there and accessible to all. 

My only criticism of the current internet era regarding music is the echo chamber of opinion. Artists making unoriginal, or even bad music have their large fan bases posting never being rivers of praise online, music critics are now few and far between. People are constantly having their potentially bad taste reinforced by the online community to the point where many listeners of shallow, badly written and performed music cannot handle the concept of criticism and react to it with outrage.

But it is somewhat the same in this sense; good music will live on (like the music from the 90s you listen to now) while bad music will have its 15 minutes of fame and then die off into the mists of time. There was always temporary, trend based music from all eras and much of it was quite bad. We just don’t hear it anymore.

How many new artists you hear on Spotify have a good track, you get all excited go to their page and the rest of the songs on the album are horse shit? Labels don’t give as much resources and time to newer artists for them to be able to craft a collection of amazing songs.

If you weren't alive back then, then it's hard to grasp just how much of an imprint the Cold War left on the world, and it's impossible to explore it fully here.

The 90's with My Bloody Valentine and Björk's crazy steeps ahead in creativity are almost more admireble than anything else in music I think. But I don't think that's about sound engineering.

som1w9,hwdmyls,t3_som1w9,"I consider 50s music divided between before and after Elvis. The average age of the record-buyer at the beginning of the decade was the mid-20s, but in 1956--the year of Elvis--the age kept plummeting until teenagers were buying most of the 45rpm singles. And it's been that way ever since.

My father hated Elvis (my mom loved him), and he prefers the earlier 50s with Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Patti Page, Doris Day, the Ames Brothers, Johnnie Ray, Frankie Laine, Teresa Brewer, Bing Crosby, Julie London, Dean Martin, Perry Como, Nat King Cole. I was raised on this music and still enjoy it (so does my dad!)

The latter part of the decade was mostly dominated by rock and roll artists appealing to the teenagers: Bill Haley & the Comets (who were much more popular in the UK), Elvis, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers, Ricky Nelson, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Connie Francis, Brenda Lee, Harry Belafonte, Sam Cooke, Jimmie Rodgers, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darin, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Andy Williams, Kingston Trio, Richie Valens.

And don't forget the instrumental hits, there were a lot of those in the 1950s-60s. And numerous one-hit wonders (I love one-hit wonder songs!)

Artists from the 1960s (and there's a division here, too, before and after 1964, the start of Beatlemania) with artists from the 50s still going strong in the early 60s: Ricky Nelson, Connie Francis, Brenda Lee, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darrin, Dion, The Everly Brothers, Pat Boone, Sam Cooke, The Four Seasons, Simon & Garfunkel, the Mamas and Papas, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Temptations (Motown put out fantastic music during the 1960s), Supremes, Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Barbra Streisand, Monkees, Sly & the Family Stone, Sonny & Cher, Roy Orbison, the Shirelles, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Beach Boys, Little Stevie Wonder, the Dave Clark Five, Herman's Hermits, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.

Believe it or not, a lot of these musical artists are still with us.

The soundtrack to the 1973 movie American Graffiti is an excellent way to listen to a lot of late 50s-early 60s music, that's how I was introduced. I love the music from the 1940s through the 1980s and listen to it all the time.

That is, until you get to *Barry Bonds* and *Drunk and Hot Girls*.

First off, a lot of punk and rock music is going to focus on major chords. You’re going to want to start to learn extended chords: 7ths, 9ths, 11ths. Related to that, start to work on inversions of chords. 

A lot of jazzers focus on modes, so you’re going to want to look into mode theory. Here’s a quick intro: https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/music-modes-major-and-minor/

A lot of what I’ve written is looking at “comping” or how to play melodies or to play chords to accompany a melody. 

The other thing to tackle as a jazz guitarist is soloing / improvising. This one is a giant weak spot for me, but the Berkelee site might be a great one to start at.

I’ll also add that tuning a guitar with standard tuning, then further tuning every string a half step lower, is something I have seen old blues players do to deepen the quality of their sound.

Truly the best way to experience this is to try it for yourself; on a guitar, play an open E in standard tuning, then downtime every string a half step and play E again (note that this E will not be an open E any longer and instead will be where F is normally played, when in regular, standard tuning).

Talent and promotion are a lot, but a big component is still basic luck, and timing. A song can be a big hit if its released one month, but not if it's released a month later. That sort of thing can't be predicted, except by a few specialist music producers (who are in great demand). George Martin, Timbaland, eg.

The greatest song writers in the world, (Lennon/McCartney, eg.) didn't have every song blow up.

There are a few people who can write nothing but hits, like Burt Bacharach/Hal David and Chinn & Chapman, but there seems to be a divide between people who write whole strings of great hits, and those who actually perform songs.

Metallica ranked at no. 18 on the Billboard top artists of the 90s list.   Billboard rankings are apparently also not a measure of quality.

>- Sold out Madison Square Garden

Metallica sold out MSG, not only for a concert, but for a *listening party* for one of their shitty albums, back in 1991.  Selling out MSG is apparently *also* not a measure of quality.

>- Nominated for six Grammy awards, including “Album of the Year” and “Best Rock Album.”

Metallica has been nominated 23 times for Grammys, and has actually *won* 9 of them for some fucking reason.  So Grammy awards/nominations are yet another thing that are not a measure of quality.

>Ranked as the second best-selling foreign act in the U.S. of the 2000s (behind The Beatles)

Metallica has sold 6.7 million records in Canada.  I don't know where that puts them as far as rankings for foreign acts in Canada, but it's a shit-ton of sales.  High sales in countries other than an artist's home country are not a measure of quality.

>- The eleventh best-selling music act of the decade overall

Metallica is the 34th best-selling ""music"" (I guess) act of *all time*.  Once again, sales are not a measure of quality.

> 12 juno awards

Metallica isn't even from Canada and has won a Juno award (nominated for 5). Guess what's also not a measure of quality.

>- 6 Billboard music awards

Metallica has won 3 of them, out of 3 nominations.  Need I remind you that those awards also are not a measure of quality?

I could go on and on, but the point is that if Metallica can get all those accolades, the accolades obviously don't mean shit.  If nothing else, they certainly don't equate to *good* music.

soj2au,hw94k3r,t3_soj2au,"Sgt Pepper. 

We generally think of it as a classic rock staple now. It was very controversial at the time, even panned by many critics. The Beatles took a huge chance giving up the road and becoming a studio-only band. To thrive, they had to transition from singles-based music and develop concept albums with deliberate sequencing meant to be listened to as a whole. (Rubber Soul and Revolver were deliberately sequenced, but Sgt. Pepper was the first Beatles album that blended tracks and offered a unique experience when listening to the whole thing.)

 While they weren't the first to deliberate sequence albums, and this wasn't the first concept album, both  practices were still very much on the cutting edge, and basically adoption of the album format by stars on that level led to domination of the album format in the 1970s.",4,0,0,0,4,False,False,False,1644429497.0

I have a pet peeve when people complain about there not being good music these days, because there is better music with way more musicians, and way more access to music all around the world than in any time in history, just some google searching away. Just to be clear, I'm not talking about your comment, you had good qualifiers.

Its just, hey, there are 7 billion people on the planet and I hear people in america complaining about the lack of good music but they do no searching and dont explore music from around the world and new subgenres.

So there’s this place in northern Florida called The Spirit of Suwannee that is absolutely magical. This is a venue and they hold multiple feats, but want to tell you more about the venue as a whole. What makes it so good you may ask…..??

Lineup - completely subjective, but this venue that puts on festivals year round focus on the jam scene but also bluegrass, funk, etc. 
They get the top tier and know how to properly set a lineup to curate a wonderful experience.
Another point is all the festivals I’ve been to there have two stages but only one band on at a time.
They have a more electronic fest at Halloween called hulaween and Suwannee rising is a little more Americana. Always a solid lineup though. 

Venue- outdoor. Set in a swamp in Florida complete with Spanish moss and the likes. You can (could) camp with an open fire, and the camping is around little ponds and grooves. Golf carts can be brought or rented. Keep in mind the biggest fest they throw is still less than 10k which compared to a big fest is my main reason to like it. 

You don’t have to worry about keeping up with friends really and I would easily pop back to the campsite during the middle of a set for whatever and come right back. Security was not a factor. Keep in mind I haven’t been since 2015 but this place is special in my heart. Specifically bear creek in 2013 was my favorite of all time. Everyone is super nice and there are a lot of families but they are super heady and cool.

I get it, Joe Hardcore is a shithead, I agree, but from launch to 2013 or 2014, this was the best weekend of hardcore anywhere. 

Most people there had seen most of those bands dozens of times, and it was so damn long, it should have been exhausting and boring. Perhaps it was in the grand scheme but so many bands still managed to have incredibly memorable sets at this fest. Over the years Title fight, wisdom in chains, converge, code orange kids, madball, trapped under ice, h2o, bane, youth of today, and gorilla biscuits all had sets I think about years later. I’m not a bad luck 13 fan, but I brought a buddy in his 40s who hadn’t ever been to a hardcore show one of the last years I decided to go (13 or 14). He still talks about those redbull bar tables flying around the electric factory and that dumb fucking kid getting pounced on when the cinderblock came out of his bag. 

It was like 3 months worth of great shows in one weekend, and that’s if you were lucky enough to live in one of few cities that put out great hardcore and were a stop on most notable tours.

This is a big reason why the 'classic' albums you mention are the ones people tend to go for on vinyl.

Therefore you should just look at albums that sound great on any format. And, arguably, those are probably gonna sound best of all on CD (and more so on SACD if you have the means to play it). IMO there are a few exceptions, and those tend to be bluesy stuff that benefits from a little crackle and distortion.

snm00x,hw55lpq,t3_snm00x,"Robert Johnson - He sounds exceptionally raw and might not seem spectacular but that would be because he was the first of his kind. Everything blues related you hear stemmed from that guy

Howlin’ Wolf - Iconic voice, with some iconic songs. Everybody’s fightin’ about a spoonful

Lightnin’ Hopkins - Same vein. Had such hits as Baby Please Don’t Go and Shotgun Blues

John Lee Hooker - Boom Boom might be the most recognizable blues song out there

Sonny Boy Williamson - One of the all time great harmonica players. There’s a live video on youtube where he comes walking out in the smoothest manner I’ve ever seen and introduces Lonnie Johnson who plays Another Night To Cry, completely tears the place apart. It’s sort of surreal seeing what blues performances were like in the 50’s, I’ll see if I can find the link

The 3 Kings; BB, Albert and Freddie - All blues gods, highly influential across the board

Muddy Waters - Same vein. There’s a pretty epic recording of him and Johnny Winter doing Mannish Boy, I’ll come back with this link as well. I haven’t been able to find the whole concert if it even exists (especially in that high of quality) but I’ll keep digging

Stevie Ray Vaughan - I think this choice speaks for itself. The live albums are especially incredible but my personal favorite is Carnegie Hall. Hearing Cold Shot with that sort of “loud” ambiance is exactly what the original recording needed IMO

Eric Clapton - Before you throw pitchforks at me because hating Clapton is Reddit’s favorite activity nowadays hear me out, put everything aside and just listen to the guy. The unplugged album, One More Car One More Rider, and Riding With the King (namely, with BB King) are up there with my favorite albums of all time across all genres. The man is wickedly well versed and surrounds himself with some excellent musicians

Kenny Wayne Shepherd - He and his band are fantastic live. Fun fact Chris Layton is his current drummer, who was half of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s backing band Double Trouble

Eric Johnson - He leans into a sort of jazz/blues fusion but *man* if you get the chance to see him live do so, he puts on an absolute clinic. The set from Austin City Limits is definitely worth checking out, the solo on Desert Rose slays

so1yz5,hw77yhi,t3_so1yz5,"The things I used, aside from two of the ones you named (MediaMonkey, MusicBrainz or Picard whatever one or the other was)...I have the same and basically for wanting to have them all having a decent title and furthermore, BPM because I like to fool around with Traktor Studio 3 and mix myself. Now, Traktor does have an analyze system itself, I'll run that in a sec to make a screenshot, but like other software when you do want the BPM you'll see that every now and then there are songs being either double BPM or half BPM. Not the end of the word since i can simply adjust it while playing with special buttons (x2 /2) for that. And I want to see the music keys. My Traktor [studio](https://i.imgur.com/7fvocPC.png) of some analyzed tracks. 

*I had this written for in the end, but maybe better to show right away for when the screens looks so shitty ;)*  


> Screenshot resolutions are probably way off. My normal monitor I have to redo some setting, it's not getting a signal and hard reset didn't work (I changed input from VGA to DVI and now I can't go in a menu, but that's a thing for later today cause [I had a very old one laying around](https://i.imgur.com/gF8MZc2.jpg) and was racing and gaming on my TV anyway most of the time. 






What I liked other than that, it's not free (but you can find it 'free' somewhere) is BeaTunes, especially the correction of artist names, titles, albums, titles, finding duplicates and then easily select to keep the ones with highest bitrate, the oldest file, the longer file etc. It's also useful for the smaller things like the removal of who uploaded it, small or big spelling mistakes, genre is less important to me since I know what most tracks are...let me run an example with some new stuff I needed to analyze.  

So, since it also links with Discogs, I looked for your specific titles and made some screenshots [they have hundreds collections per title](https://imgur.com/a/IpQaZiU) When you click on each individual you see they specify almost east track while in the long screenshots like this, it looks as if they just name it all the same and  of course it has duplicates, [so one of them](https://i.imgur.com/G1jKtB4.jpg) should always be right ;) to find the correct titles for you. Beatunes also has 'colors' which makes it easier for DJ-ing and making playlists of 'the same mood' type music. 
 

kay, added some random folder I had to analyze. [First started to](https://i.imgur.com/DhBaaOp.png) check them [on duplicates and errors etc](https://i.imgur.com/Y96v5zg.png), here it's what it [will scan for](https://i.imgur.com/CjpmDn1.png) when you'd select almost everything. 


What I tried last week though IS free and can ALSO do that and is called...erm...I'll get back on that in a sec but already wanted to write this before I forget. I get that it will make less sense when you read it in one go. Found it, One Tagger. It says: [""Great for DJ's"" or something](https://i.imgur.com/2ciFujx.png), but when it comes to house music, unless you look up the popular stuff, it's often hard to get good sources, in a way with you and game soundtracks too. You still need people who have added it. I was recently making a playlist of old hardcore 90s/00s and hardcore simply isn't a very popular genre worldwide for much input on these sites. 

[One Tagger on Github](https://onetagger.github.io) and it looks like this when I start 'er up. Some of the [sources it will check](https://i.imgur.com/kIUlPbp.png) even without an account there. Started it and it first checks one source and then the missing with other sources. So far [hit and miss on Beatport now](https://i.imgur.com/OrqwOLL.png).....[five mins later](https://i.imgur.com/BjhTS42.png)

On your last question, I do think I saw the option in one of the programs, I just can't find it that quick which one (maybe I uninstalled it). I never had issues with that because I normally just do Flac or MP3. What you could do is download: [""Everything""](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) which is a Windows Search tool. Whenever I look for a track and either the title or whatever is missing/faulty, but I do know the length, I can sort on that. When I do know the format, I can quickly sort on that. That way you could achieve what you want yourself within seconds per file format when they are in relatively close folders to each other. If not then it's still pretty quick to sort them on that, cut and paste them in your own folders. 

[Here, easily sorted](https://i.imgur.com/0YQNrUJ.png) No Windows Search where you can take a 3 week trip, come back and it's still searching. 


Sorry for the wall of text, but since I spotted something after I made the pic, zoom in to the right side of that pic of how my 'setup' now looks with that crappy monitor. I am energized so to speak. It's 9 in the morning though, that sucks. But have the week off, will sleep tonight. I will probably made some errors with screenshots, but I don't want to check it now.

snstzv,hw5ecw8,t3_snstzv,"The Hit Makers by Les Paul and Mary Ford is a pretty cool compilation of their biggest singles.  Les Paul invented overdubbing, the modern solid body electric guitar, and had several major hits in the early 50's with Mary Ford.  The Hit Makers is most of their biggest hits.  It basically is the 1950s equivalent of alternative because of how the overdubbing and effects on guitar create a unique sound and somebody singing in harmony with themselves was pretty revolutionary.  Also Les Paul could shred.

They tend to sound a bit samey, and only one album is all you need, but his hits are incredibly important for the history of music.  It's a shame he doesn't get talked about more.  I guess that's what happens when Rock and Roll changes pop music a few years after your big break.

 - TL;DR : artistic decisions that arguably obscure the intent of other, previous artistic decisions probably require deeper analysis as to whether they’re beneficial inclusions or not




I think there’s an argument to be made that artistic decisions made based on trends, which also counteract a song’s ability to express its artistic intent, can fairly be considered “bad.” 

Autotune was a massive trend, and for late 2000s, early 2010s pop and rnb that was trying to go for a futuristic, synthetic sound, it’s a texture that falls in line with that intent. Autotune on, say, a rustic and acoustic bluegrass ballad, feels generally out of place by comparison.

Similarly, Californication being a bittersweet mid-tempo pop-rock track prominently featuring clean guitar tones and moody vocals with sparse effects, it would probably stand that compressing the dynamic range of these sounds to a noticeable degree would undermine the intent behind most of the other creative decisions made on the song. Considering the other commenter’s reference to the popularity of a fan-made “unmastered” version, it seems like this is a generally held feeling.

I agree at the end of the day a creative decision is a creative decision and “good” and “bad” is up to interpretation, but I think it’s constructive to consider what it is about certain creative decisions that allow for impactful and compelling art.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1644384741.0

You will need an audio interface to either plug the guitar into (direct) or to plug the microphone into to mic your amplifier. 

Something like a Focusrite Solo ($120) is popular, but I don't care for Focusrite as either they make unreliable crap or I have the worst possible luck you could have with their interfaces randomly breaking while sitting untouched on my desk. I've had 3 die randomly in ~10 years. I'd spend a bit more (~$200) and get something really nice like a Motu M2 or something.

Then you will need a decent microphone. No an iPhone microphone is not good enough. I'd also avoid any expensive USB mics, as those are pretty much universally not that great and massively overpriced.

Spend the $99 to get an SM57. It's pretty much the industry standard for mic'ing guitar amps. Also you can hammer nails with it if you need to because it's practically indestructible.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644395973.0

That generic 60s love pop sound you talk about probably wouldn't have been what it was without them.

That being said, it's impossible to be an iconic band for 60 years without becoming overrated, overhyped, sort of a holy cow, so to an extent I do agree with you.

snjuol,hw6b55g,t3_snjuol,"""Which"" is a tough question with so many answers 😅
Here are a few of my personal favorite movie soundtracks:

""Singles"" - several big names of grunge, an era and genre which I personally love

""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" - Ennio Morricone's masterpiece in my opinion (I have to mention Cinema Paradiso's soundtrack which is also wonderful)

""Pulp Fiction"" - In my opinion one of the best movie and soundtrack when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's movies, I'll always love and rock to that Dick Dale surf rock intro

""Saving Private Ryan"" - So powerful and emotional that it perfectly fits the movie itself, one of the best John Williams' compositions and also one of Steven Spielberg's best movies

""Into the Wild"" - This is Eddie Vedder's at his best solo work, simply brilliant and remarkable, just as the movie and the journey it depicts

""Trainspotting"" - Another great movie and soundtrack filled with plenty of the great britpop and britrock hits of that time

And I am sure that I could remember and mention others as well, like Inception, Reservoir Dogs, Purple Rain, Baby Driver and so on, but these were the ones, an in no particular sorting criteria.

And how our fathers music taste from the 70s shapes our music taste, and shapes our nostalgia for the music our parents played when we were young

I think it's a mix of the weird anti-disco white men who are our dads now which closed them off from pretty much all r&b after the 60s and the angst which was popular in the 70s and even more so through the 90s/2000s for a lot of young men. 

Like my dad likes some Earth Wind and Fire but seems to think a lot of their music is to disco-y

Between the popularity of rock and grunge/nu-metal i think  a lot of us and our fathers paid little attention to soul/funk. And any stuff that did get popular was considered (at least to my dad) to be pop-y and substanceless and written off before given a chance. So the music my parents played, and I'm nostalgic for now mostly consists of classic rock and pop hits like Cindy Lauper

And if it wasn't rock, hip hop served a similar function with its similarly angsty music for 90s kids

then he deleted his channel several times to just come back again. he made a big show out of it. of everything. he told his professor he's nothing because he earns less than morgen.

he shows people in his music videos how he's throwing money, jumping on girls asses (haha) u no this luxurious living with him making dumb faces. also he made a track out of his own fart (he used it as a sample).

he's been in so many scandals here. he used to ride on a wheelchair for fun, argue with everybody (i am the best i am the best) and afterall making dumb lyrics in his songs. very dumb lyrics.

And access to every artist, album and song ever. I usually scan r_music and download highly recommended albums. They download to your phone in 15-20 seconds.

I see a lot of people criticising Spotify for pigeon-holing their music tastes for them and not exposing them to new music. I never had a personal assistant growing up who would solely curate music for me though, so I don't know how Spotify is somehow worse. I had to go off recommendations from friends or the staff at CD stores, and then either borrow those CDs from said friends or pay full price for them at said CD store. Compared to Spotify, it's a horrible way to find new music. 

Personally, I think the recommendations that come from streaming algorithms (TV, audio books, music, you name it) made people unsurprisingly lazy, surprisingly quickly. OP found plenty of music they love back in the day on iTunes. Great! Imagine if they were that proactive in *searching* for new music on Spotify??!",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644306392.0
