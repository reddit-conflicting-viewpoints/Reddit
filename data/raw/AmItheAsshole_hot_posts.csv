t7891w,AITA for telling my brother to go ahead and sue my husband for breaking his Hearing-Aid during a prank?,,17390,0.96,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7891w/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_go_ahead_and_sue/,2853,"

Context: My brother (23) is a college student with a hearing disability, My parents got him a 4k worth of hearing aid to be able to hear properly.


So, Last week while my husband (32) and I (26) were visiting my parents, My husband hid my brother's hearing aid as a prank and it got damaged in the process. After looking for the hearing aid for hours, My husband handed it back to my brother while laughing in his face about how freaked out he looked. He didn't know how delicate this type of device is and ended up breaking it while hiding it. My brother had a breakdown and started yelling at my husband and threatning him with court if he doesn't pay up for new hearing aid. My husband didn't think he was serious and laughed him off, I was mortified to say the least, I told my brother to do it, sue my husband if he had to. My husband side eyed me and said ""alright princesses"".


2 days ago, My husband came home and was full on panicing saying my brother is going through with his threat and is suing, I shrugged and remained calm and collected, He started yelling WTF at my reaction then, urged me to call my brother and tell him to back down but I sad no, he did this to himself and deserves no sympathy or advocating from me. He was shocked, he yelled that it was just a prank with no intentions of hurting anyone then shamed me for not taking his side, moreover, he said that my brother only felt confident in suing him after I ""encouraged"" him by telling him to go ahead and sue. We had an argument then I went upstairs and stayed in my room. he must've called my parents because he later complained about them deciding to stay out of it and let my brother sue. He then complained about how this is going to affect us both since he doesn't have that kind of money to give to my brother.


This morning he blew up at me saying me and my family are a bunch of sad, pathetic asshole who can't take a joke, and are willing to easily drag others to court and ruin their relationship with them over a couple of grands. AITA?",1646482500.0
t7dsrn,AITA for forcing my husband to wake up and watch the kids on his dayoff?,,2960,0.95,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7dsrn/aita_for_forcing_my_husband_to_wake_up_and_watch/,1163,"

Hi. First I'm gonna mention that I'm normally the one who stays with the kids ALL the time, due to being a stay at home mom. DH works full time (He's a Police Officer, have been for 5 years now) and covers night shifts. His off days are unpredictable, but I told him I needed to make an appointment with the salon to cut my hair before my sister's wedding and had only one week. I told him to let me know when he'll be available to stay with the kids but he said he doesn't know since he was swapping shifts randomly throughtout the week.

Yesterday, He came home from a nightshift at 11am and went straight to bed. I had already booked with a salon, I went to get ready then woke him up to tell him that he needed to wake up and watch the kids while I go to the salon. He refused, I kept waking him up while he kept telling me to go away. I pulled the sheets and he yelled at me to stop. I told him I was getting late for my appointment and he said that this wasn't on him and that he wasn't going to use his day off to stay awake and watch the kids. we had a fight and he ended up calling me inconsiderate and selfish because I had a goodnight sleep while he didnt, then expecting him to watch the kids on his day off. I told him those are his kids too and he needed to step up since I do this all the time. I walked out while he kept yelling at me to come back.


I returned hours later and he was right there waiting with an angry look on his face. he started arguing with me about how tired and sleep deprived he was and how selfish and awful I was to leave and force him to wake up and watch the kids on his day off over a stupid haircut. I told him it was not a big deal and he was being negative for no reason when he should be encouraging me to take care of myself. He said that I caught him off guard and ruined his day off completely, now he can't even walk without feeling dizzy and exhausted because I took away his rest time and acted selfishly.


he's been pouting since then, AITA for leaving him with the kids on his dayoff?

ETA because I just got back to this thread and saw a couple of questions...

(1) Yes, he was 100% aware that I had limited time to pay the salon a visit and even said he'd tell me when he'd be available but he never did.

(2) Yes, He did call my new haircut 'stupid' and now I feel horrible about it üòñ.

(3) I was gone for like 4 hours and he had the rest of the day to get some sleep but decided to stay awake and pick arguments with me.",1646499774.0
t7b5k8,AITA for telling my dad my mother‚Äôs homework is not my responsibility?,,4392,0.98,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7b5k8/aita_for_telling_my_dad_my_mothers_homework_is/,391,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My (me, 28F) mother (her, late 50s) started college in January and it‚Äôs been hell ever since. English is not her first language and she‚Äôs been struggling. Every single one of us minus my father have been helping her with her homework and assignments (read: doing it for her) and we‚Äôre exhausted. She forgets how to use a computer when someone is there with her but she uses one at work all the time, she‚Äôll ask us how to submit homework despite having submitted something a couple days prior and she refuses to ask the professor questions if we don‚Äôt do it for her. 

So I decided to go out this weekend and celebrate some friends‚Äô birthdays. I packed a weekend bag and made my way to my car when my dad asked me where I was going. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out‚Äù and he says ‚Äúwho‚Äôs going to help your mother with her homework?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyou guys are‚Äù (meaning he and my brother) and that was not good enough for him. Despite the fact that I already correct and help her submit all of her homework, have a job and play the role of mom/professor, I have to stay home to answer all of her questions and help her find articles and do research. I‚Äôm at my wits end and said ‚ÄúI already do everything, you don‚Äôt even help her, you stand next to her and tell her to do the wrong thing, you don‚Äôt even know how to do citations and you went to university. Am I supposed to say home and do her homework for her? I‚Äôm not responsible for her homework.‚Äù

Side note: one thing about my dad is that he loves to dismiss people and their feelings. When I was younger and struggling with school or literally anything, his response would be ‚Äúyou think you‚Äôre the only person who struggled? I ___ and I dealt with it.‚Äù So I just learned to do a lot things on my own. Like asking for help stresses me out. Yes I am in therapy for that.

He called me mean and aggressive and my mother stayed quiet. I later found out that she texted my sister and she tried chewing me out before I told her exactly what happened. A part of me feels bad because that‚Äôs my mom but another part of me is making me realize that I‚Äôm back at school and stressed out. I literally do everything + my own job, I barely get any financial or emotional support from them.

Edit: She does her work and I look over it but it‚Äôs almost never correct so it has to be redone.

Edit 2: She‚Äôs already in her field and is just going back to get a promotion, which is fair. There are no exams or tests, just assignments and group work and it‚Äôs all online. I live at home because I live in Toronto and don‚Äôt have $1mil to buy a house like many others who live in this city and get no support from their parents.",1646492251.0

Me and Sarah weren‚Äôt in a good spot. But we went ahead with the pregnancy. But our problems got worse. We fought constantly and weren‚Äôt intimate. I was the only one working and felt like I was being used. There was a lot of resentment and I ended up cheating when Chloe was 2. It wasn‚Äôt right at all. I should have just left. I was 21 and immature. 

We got split custody and ever since it‚Äôs been brutal with Sarah. She undermines me and wont consult me on decisions. Doesn‚Äôt stop her friends/family from shit talking me to Chloe. When Chloe was 11 she found out I cheated on her mom and has been a nightmare since. She would lock herself in her room and give me the silent treatment. She would basically only speak to me to ask when could she go back to her mom. This started at age 11 and went on for four years. Chloe kept saying horrible things to me. She banned me from attending her life events. The final straw was when I started dating again and she messaged a girl that I posted a picture with. Saying how I‚Äôm a cheater and a POS. 

After that I was done. I texted Sarah, congratulating her on her win. Our daughter hates me and doesn‚Äôt respect me. How I‚Äôm just done with it. I‚Äôm not taking Chloe anymore because I‚Äôm tired of being treated like crap. And if Chloe hates me then I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs best she‚Äôs around me anymore. I said I‚Äôd still pay till she‚Äôs 18 but I‚Äôm done being a punching bag. That was 2.5 years ago and I haven‚Äôt spoken to Chloe since. I‚Äôll send her a birthday card but that‚Äôs about it. 

Well about a two years ago I met Kristen (29F) and she‚Äôs amazing. We are set to get married this summer. When forming the guest list she asked about my daughter (she‚Äôs aware of the situation). I told her that we don‚Äôt have a relationship so I don‚Äôt see the need to invite her. Also it‚Äôs a special day for us and I don‚Äôt know what my daughter is capable of anymore due to Sarah. I don‚Äôt want her ruining anything or causing a scene. I thought the matter was settled. I get a call from Sarah and it‚Äôs her screaming at me. Saying Chloe was upset that she found out thru Facebook that I was engaged. I told Sarah that the relationship between us is her fault. And that she shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. Chloe got on the phone and started yelling at me. Saying I never support her anymore. I said that she banned me from her events, called me a POS everyday for 3 years so she shouldn‚Äôt be shocked that I don‚Äôt wanna be talked to like that. And that I do support her, I pay child support, I pay for her car and I pay the lions share of her private schooling. So she should watch what she says before implying that I don‚Äôt support her. The conversation started to deteriorate so I simply said ‚ÄúChloe I can‚Äôt trust that you won‚Äôt do something and this is a special day for me. So if you want to re connect then maybe another time and place‚Äù. My fianc√© is supportive. But I kinda feel like an AH. AITA?",1646500350.0

My(21M) son just turned 4 last Sunday, as usual we had a small party at my mother's house and we invited my brother's(30M) kids (8M, 6M and 5M) and my sisters (27) daughter (4) as well as some neighbors.

Usually when is one of the kids birthday's all of them blows the candles because that's how my mom used to do with us, yet ever since my kiddo turned 2 he has refused to do so. Last year when his cousins had to blow theirs he didn't participated and when his birthday came he didn't want anyone to do it with him, but all of the kids ended up throwing themselves at the cake and did it anyway. 

I kid you not, my son cried for the rest of the evening and refused to eat his cake, my sister talked to her daughter about how that wasn't right but my brother said that my son was a ""little prick"" and he had to learn how to share. We stopped talking for a monthly after that until my mother forced us to make amends.

 A week ago I told them that their kids weren't allowed to blow the candles with my son, my brother didn't liked it of course, but my SIL said that she was gonna explain it to her kids and that it was okay. Fast forward to the party, my gf comes with our kiddo's cake, we gather around the table and we sing happy birthday to my boy, when he's about to blow his goddamn candles I notice that my nephew (6) is about to do it too and I cover his mouth with my hand. My kid doesn't notice, blows them and jumps straight to his momma's arms all happy.

My nephew starts to cry and tells to my brother that ""I didn't let him do it and it's not fair"", my SIL tries to explain him something but my brother comes right at me for ""not letting his kid have fun"", I remind him that I told them my son was gonna do it alone but he says ""that's not how we do it"" and I told him ""Well that's how I do it now, if you don't like it you can leave"". My mom is telling him that I'm joking but my brother took his kids and leaves, my son is obviously confused but ends up playing with some other kids and forgetting about it.

My mom says that I'm and AH for doing it and that my son has to understand that this is our way and is forcing me to apologize, my gf and sister says that I'm right because is my son's birthday after all and I don't know what to do.

ETA: People I get it. We shouldn't be blowing candles. I'll do better next time. That wasn't the question tho.",1646461517.0

I'm generally good with people walking through it taking their dog a walk or hiking or even local kids playing there as it's a safe place and beautiful and so long as they don't cause any damage or mess with the trees I see no reason to get upset over this. 

An issue came up however tonight when I was on a walk and I saw a fire through the trees I admit I panicked thinking a dog walker had been out and tossed a cigarette or some local teenagers were setting fires for fun. I rushed out to check on it and try to put out the fire and found one of my neighbours camping with their girlfriend and friends, it was a group of five people in their mid 20s and they had a roaring campfire going. 

They got startled by me rushing up to them like that and asked me what the fuck I was doing, I asked them the same question back and told them they couldn't camp here and they'd not asked permission to do so. This led to some laughter and protests that they were doing any harm and to ""Lighten up"" I told them to put the fucking fire out and get off my land, I didn't want to risk a campfire there as it could easily get out of hand especially when the group manning it were more than a little drunk.

They ended up refusing stating they weren't going anywhere and were not doing anything wrong so I went home and called the police to get them off my property, they were made to leave and break up their camp. 

Am I maybe the asshole for this? they probably thought it was ok as i'm good with letting people use my land in general, I maybe could have handled it *better* but i'd gotten a fright seeing the fire and then how they responded....it just really got to me.",1646464017.0

Well my bf proposed that we move into together in an apartment, which I‚Äôm a bit hesitate to do so. He makes more money than me, I believe twice as much as my income monthly which is a little over $4,500. He wants to live is complete unaffordable apartment (monthly $3,000-$4,000) with me and expects me to pay 50/50 when I literally can‚Äôt afford that type of living. I explained to him that I was willing to put down 40% of my income into rent alone (comes out to be $1000), but I won‚Äôt budge from that‚Ä¶ that if he wants to live there than he will have to pay most of the rent. Or we will go for a much cheaper option, but he wants an extra room for his own hobbies.

He got upset and told me it‚Äôs unfair that men are expected to financially take care of everything, he can‚Äôt understand why I just don‚Äôt take money out of my savings to afford that rent. He‚Äôs just asking for half on rent and he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs being unreasonable.

We definitely have a major difference of income and he can‚Äôt expect me to afford everything that he can afford. That I would be willing to pitch in rent for 40% of my income, if he‚Äôs unwilling to budge from 50/50 then we‚Äôll have to find a more affordable apartment room to fit my price range. If not then I‚Äôm abandoning the idea of moving together, I‚Äôm fine with living with my roommates and occasionally crashing over at his current place. 

Am I being unreasonable?! I mean I just can afford that place with my current income!

I was born into a religion and because my mom got remarried to someone with a different religion, my mom and I converted. I was around 11 when I converted and I obviously didn't have any say in it. My name, school, city, clothes changed. I felt trapped. 

When I turned 15 i told my mother that she could do what ever she wants but if she forces anything on me, I will go live with my dad while she could be a good dumb wife to her husband. This worked out and everything stopped. I also asked her to Change my name but she said I could do it after I turn 18 because my school life will be affected so I agreed. 

My friend (I'll call her M) and I became friends when I changed schools. I made three other friends and we pretty much had a great time together. They were very supportive of me wanting to change back to my past self. M belonged to the same religion (the one I converted to). I would never really have conversations about the bullshit I had to go through because it would hurt her. She only knew that I wanted to change my name. 

It's finally Time and my school would be ending in 2 months (My school year would be from July to March but got extended to April) and I'll turn 18 in August. So everything is going by the plan. M somehow got to know about the fact that I wanted to leave due to religious trauma. My other friend blurted it out. M got mad. 

She started telling me that I'm making mistakes by changing. She tried to convince me by reading verses from her holy book and translating it. I just told her that I don't want to offend her but she needs to keep her stuff to herself. She does the same bullshit and would tell me the horrifying ways I'm going to die. She crossed the line a few days ago. She had the audacity to Call my mom and ask her to not let me do it. She told her that I'm converting back for the wrong reasons and my mom's going to go to hell if she lets me sin. My mom shut her down and told her that I'm the one who'll pay for my sins and it doesn't concern her. M calls my stepdad too.

I called up M crying. Told her that she needs to shut the fuck up before I complain about her to the school. I told her that I'll complain to the principal that she calls my parents when they don't want to have conversations with her and doesn't leave me alone. My friends tried to convince me not to complain but after some days I did because I was scared my mom will change her mind on helping me out. 

M's parents have been called to meet the principal. My friends aren't speaking to me because they believe that M's behavior didn't affect my plans but my complaint against her will have her grounded and her parents will be really strict with her. 

I understand how bad this is going to affect M but if her behavior affects my mom, my whole life will be ruined. So AITA?",1646485349.0

before we got divorced I had found his mobile phone and seen some strange messages from someone with some explicit comments about nights out and how they are looking forward to meeting up next, (name on the phone was generic alexi), I left the phone on the bed and went and spoke to a friend of mine the next day who also knew my husband and said he would find out who this Alexi was after work, turns out Alexi was a man and my husband had been having an affair with him (this was outside their workplace and they were co-workers)  
 

confronted my husband and he told me that the only reason he married me was to get his parents and family off his back and that he had been seeing other men over the years (Alexi for the last 3 and half years), he said it was a relief that he could finally tell me and that he wanted me to stay with him so his family would not cut him off along with the kids.

Kicked him out and filed for divorce, the divorce took a few months and he did fight it and tried to keep the marriage intact (this was a sham marriage from the start) at one point he told me not to tell the kids why this was happening and just tell them that our marriage was not working out, I told him they have a right to know and told them about the affairs and the reason, his parents asked me and I told the truth.

WIBTA for asking her to take it down? 

My mom wrote a book about parenting when I was about 17, with some personal narratives and advice in it-- think ""battle hymn of the tiger mother"" type of stuff. Today I went to look at its Amazon reviews out of curiosity, and found a review under my name from 2014, praising the book and the views expressed within it. I did not write this review. My mother and I have had an incredibly fraught relationship since I was a teenager, and several of the parenting ""techniques"" that this book and the review praise are part of the reason that we barely talk, including her obsession with controlling my sexuality, weight and gender presentation. 

I know this is a fake review written by her because: 

* While it's only under a first name, it's my deadname (I'm trans). This name is extremely uncommon and I have never met or heard of another person who shares the same name with the same spelling. 
* The username for the review is Name\_1 and that user has no other reviews.
* The review is basically just the blurb on the back of the book, with some compliments thrown in. It's a very transparently ""written by the author"" review.

I feel extremely uncomfortable with this review remaining up, and I'm insulted by the fact that she thought it was appropriate to just use my name to review a book praising her for her abusive behaviors, but I know that if I bring it up to my mother it will cause a MASSIVE fight as she'll immediately ask me if I really hated her parenting style that much, and I don't want to cause more tension than we already have.

I think I might be TA because: the review is from 2014 and isn't hurting anybody, I still went by my deadname back then, and I don't want to start a huge fight over something so insignificant.",1646487251.0
t7cnds,AITA for kicking my brother‚Äôs ex-girlfriend out the house?,,473,0.96,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7cnds/aita_for_kicking_my_brothers_exgirlfriend_out_the/,90,"I (20F) have a younger brother, ‚ÄúJacob‚Äù (17). He‚Äôd been in a relationship with Lana (also 17) for a little over a year.

My family and I thought Lana was nice. She used to come over to our house a lot and it was clear that her and Jacob really liked each other. But like most teenagers, their relationship just went sour after a while.

Jacob and I are very close, so he told me everything that was happening. According to him, Lana just started telling him that he wasn‚Äôt attractive anymore, which then turned into her making remarks at the way he did everything. I was thinking she just had ‚Äòthe ick‚Äô and told him to give her some space for a while.

He followed my advice and they didn‚Äôt speak for about two weeks until she randomly turned up on our doorstep at 1am. 

Neither me, Jacob, or our parents knew why she was there or why she didn‚Äôt call in advance to let us know she was coming, (she has all of our mobile numbers‚Ä¶ a heads-up at 1am would‚Äôve been nice). She said nothing to any of us, just barged into the doorway and started yelling at Jacob like a monster while we were all half-asleep. 

It wasn‚Äôt just like‚Ä¶ shouting. It was like some shit out of Wattpad. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anything like it in my life. It was insane to witness. There was no expression on her face at all, she was just screeching and swearing and calling him names. All I could think of the entire time was, ‚Äúwhat the fuck is happening?‚Äù 

I snapped and told her to get the fuck out of our house or I was calling the cops. My mom immediately told me to be quiet, but I was so raging angry that I completely ignored her and just steered Lana out of the house and onto the street.

I went straight back to bed without saying a word to anyone. But in the morning, I found a voicemail on my phone that ‚ÄúEllen‚Äù, one of Lana‚Äôs moms, had left for me. In it, she said that she‚Äôd found Lana crying in her bedroom. Lana had told her that she‚Äôd snuck out of the house early in the morning to talk to Jacob, and that I had bullied and berated her when she came to the door. I was basically chewed out and told that at my age, I should‚Äôve helped Lana, regardless of whether her and my brother were on good terms or not, and that kicking her out of the house was unacceptable. (Pretty clear that Lana had not told the truth whatsoever but I couldn‚Äôt be asked to care at that point. Plus, I had witnesses, so I‚Äôm not about to fight with her mom about the truth when my whole family can back me up). 

Despite all the lies, I can‚Äôt help but feel a little guilty about it now. This is a hormonal teenage girl we‚Äôre talking about. She was probably just acting on impulse. She‚Äôs also somebody that my family knows, and I‚Äôd never known her to act that way before (apart from being a little high-maintenance). I‚Äôm starting to wonder whether I should‚Äôve tried to calm her down instead of just kicking her out.

Over the last 6-8 months or so, every time we go to their home or they come to ours we end up getting extremely sick and it lasts 10-20 days. Each time this has happened my son ends up losing weight because he can‚Äôt keep food or liquids down, he runs fevers over 103¬∞F, and usually struggles to sleep because he can‚Äôt breathe well.
They always insist that they weren‚Äôt sick at any point and don‚Äôt think they are the cause, but I‚Äôm pretty certain. We stayed away from them for 2 months and in that time we only did play dates with family. In those 2 months he didn‚Äôt get sick at all. So, 2 weeks ago we invited our friends and their daughter over for a play date, and sure enough our son got sick. He‚Äôs been struggling with it for going on 15 days now. They text me earlier today asking if they can come over for a play date this weekend and I responded back by saying that we no longer wanted to have play dates with them because we knew it meant that our son and our whole household would end up sick for majority of the month. 
They were very offended and said that I was placing blame on them without proof that it is them causing the problem. They also were seemingly trying to guilt me by saying that our son is the only friend their daughter has and it‚Äôs not fair. I tried explaining that this only happens when hanging out with them and that I have to base my decision on that. Now they think ITA because ‚Äúkids just get each other sick, that‚Äôs what they do‚Äù. I know kids get each other sick occasionally, but every single time they interact seems like too much and it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me. So, did I over-react? AITA?

UPDATE:

She contacted me this morning and said she took her daughter to her the Pediatrician for Saturday clinic. They found a piece of sponge (like a cleaning sponge) lodged way back in her nose. It had grown mold. She also will have to have tonsils and adenoids removed. Her pediatrician said that the mold spores could have been causing my son‚Äôs respiratory infections since toddlers tend to put toys in their mouths often. 

Regardless, I apologized for hurting her feelings and coming across cold and abrupt.

They are the perfect tenants. While we're not friends by any means, we are quite friendly. A few years back my sister Amy came with me as I unlocked the door for their daughter who locked herself out. Last week Amy ran into the husband and wife at a Meetup.com organised dinner. While I'm unaware of the specifics, the short of it was that Amy found out that the couple were homophobic. Specifically, the couple believes that marriage is strictly between men and women.

Let me state unequivocally that I believe my tenants' opinion is disgusting. As does Amy. In fact, she's finds their opinion so repulsive that she *insists* that I kick them out of the property. For context, in my jurisdiction, you are only allowed to kick out long term tenants for a limited set of reasons. One such reason is that an immediate family member is to move in after the tenants vacate the property. My sister is so sickened by my tenants' opinion that she's willing to move in, pay the same rent, just so I can kick the family out.

Is that just not a little bit over the top? Amy didn't think so. That I did think so was enough for my sister to turn her anger towards me, and accuse me of supporting bigotry. Can I get a reality check here? Is Amy crazy, or AITA?",1646477111.0

It's possible that as part of their sentence, they'll have much of what they purchased using the illegal money taken away. This includes their cars and some pieces of art that they own. 

Vanessa also has a lot of expensive clothes. She claims to have shopped ""all over the world"" and their house has whole rooms full of her shoes and dresses. 

While they've both accepted that their previous lifestyle is over and that they're both facing a long time in prison, Vanessa doesn't want to let go of her wardrobe. 

Because of my job (construction) I own a van. Vanessa asked my wife if they could borrow it. She wants to put her clothes in my van and for me to drive it somewhere far away and store it. They've figured that while the cars are traceable by the police so they can't keep those, Vanessa's clothes aren't traceable so they can get away with keeping those. She wants to keep them for when she gets out of prison.

I told my wife that I would not be taking part in something that could potentially get us both arrested. She responded that the clothes aren't being monitored and the risk of the police coming after us is tiny. She then said I was cruel for not wanting to help a woman who is looking at years in prison. 

I don't think it's cruel at all. Even if it's a tiny risk, its still a risk. My wife and I have jobs and two children to provide for. Trouble with the police could ruin all of our lives.

My bath bombs are very special to me and my little sister (f12) knows this. We share a bathroom and each have our own cabinets/drawers to keep our toiletries in. I leave her stuff alone and she leaves my stuff alone. 

My mother and I have just gotten back from a weeklong trip to a different city in order to see some doctors that specialize in a disease I have. 

I trusted my sister with a couple tasks including making sure my pet lizards had fresh water, and keeping our little brothers (m8 and m5) away from my stuff. 

Fast forward to today, I had just returned home and was looking forward to a nice bath after a long week of being poked, prodded and tested on. 

Right away, I noticed the golden glitter in 
my bathtub. I went to check the cabinet with my bath bombs and 10 were missing. In total, about $100-$120 worth of bath bombs. Most of which were limited edition and cannot be easily replaced since they only return once a year or not at all. 

I was immediately very upset. My little brothers can‚Äôt reach the cabinet they were in and my father confirmed that they hadn‚Äôt had any baths, just showers that week- and certainly no bath bombs. 

I went to my sister‚Äôs room and asked her if she used them. She denied touching any of my stuff, but she was the only one who uses our bathroom and could get to my bath bombs. 

I started screaming at her and tried to get her to understand how valuable they were, not just monetarily- but sentimentally too. 
She kept saying that she didn‚Äôt use any of my bath bombs. 

After a while, she started crying and my parents ran into the room. I explained the situation and my mom took my side and insisted that my sister should pay me back. 

My father however, did the opposite. He said that I am in the wrong and shouldn‚Äôt be so upset over bath bombs and that I don‚Äôt need so many anyways. 


AITA???


Edit: grammar

Edit 2: After taking to her again (no screaming this time) she refused to apologize, pay for or even admit to taking my bath bombs. 

I also spoke to my brothers and they weren‚Äôt even aware of the existence of my bath bombs, then came to the consensus that they must be some gross girly thing.

Edit 3: A few people seem curious as to how my sister could possibly pay me back when she‚Äôs 12. My mother pays my Siblings for doing school since that‚Äôs their ‚Äújob‚Äù for the time being. My sister could save up the money from that in her bank account.",1646440379.0

So I (f19) recently went out to eat with a group of classmates. We get along but arent close. We just finished an assigment and to celebrate.

I have some dietary restrictions. I don't eat onion unless it's in small amounts, it makes me vomi. I also don't eat lamb, veal and game. I don't eat rabbit meat, horse meat and octopus. I don't eat anything I saw alive.

So we're all seated in the restaurant, there's five of us and the atmosphere is great. And then our food is brought to us. I ordered some pasta. Classmate no. 1 ordered lamb. No. 2 ordered game. No. 3 ordered onion soup. No. 4 got a risotto. 

When we worked on the project, we ordered takeout few times. Every time, we tasted eachothers dishes. Everyone was totally fine with that, no one was ever pressured to share nor to taste. And in the restaurant, naturally everyone wanted to share too. But I could taste only the risotto. When one person questioned me about suddently refusing to taste food from everyone but no. 4, I explained my reasons. I never brought them up before because it wasn't relevant. 

Two people just went ""ok, cool"", the onion soup person made sure that their food isn't making me feel uncomfortable/sick. But the other two got really offended. They said that it's really rude that I'm tasting food from only one person and since it's not a health issue, I can eat a little game and lamb. They said that I'm not a vegetarian, so what's the problem. 

I still refused to taste their food. All of them were welcome to try my pasta, but I wouldn't eat their meat beacuse of my personal values. 

Everyone dropped the topic, but the atmosphere was ruined. After we left the restaurant, the lamb and game people told me that they won't ever eat with me again beasuse they felt offended that I excluded them and they felt judged. This couldn't be further from truth! I don't judge anyone and I had a reason to exclude them.

Well, I don't think that I'm in wrong, but those two people are really making me start questioning it. After all, I did exclude them is sone way and eating their food would've made me feel bad only mentally, I wouldn't be physically harmed.

So, AITA for not tasting their food and excluding those two people? They're acting really hurt and ignoring me in school.",1646490583.0

My situation with my brother was unique in the sense that I was had been working since 16 and helping my mom out just to find out that my money was being used to help my other siblings. That's where my hostility towards my brother came from.

All of my siblings got married and had kids except for me. I have relationships with some but not others. I probably wouldn't have a relationship with them if it weren't for their kids. I'm the ""funcle"" and my siblings appreciate that I'm the uncle that we wished we had growing up.

Jay made it clear that he didn't want me to have a relationship with my nephew. He still hated me. I understood so whatever. 

Then came a situation where he and his wife were priced out of their dream home and asked our mom for financial help.

It rubbed me the wrong way because it made it seem like they went out of their way for me to see Nicky. Actually they went to visit our mother to pick up hand me downs and Amazon packages that she ordered. I just dropped by and now he and his wife want me to give them money too.

They didn't need gas money. It was just to see if I'd give them $20. That pissed me off. I didn't and stopped giving my mom money too. All of a sudden they had issues with me and freezing me out. 

The breaking point was when they said they would not come over if I was at my mom's. My brother started bringing up how mean I was the him growing up. I clapped back by telling him that it was more like he was trying to monetize my relationship with Nicky.

They outright did not like me in college and now have outwardly accepted me for the sake of their son. They still make side comments such as suggesting I only got into medical school because I am Black, but brag about it to their friends.

Confused, he probed further and discovered that they felt like it was shameful that my family had not saved for a wedding for me and felt my family was not smart with their money.

My fiance and I have no expectation of his family paying and have told them we plan to pay for it ourselves.

I‚Äôm 5 weeks post partum. I turned to her and said, ‚ÄúIf this is 5 month, when are you delivering?‚Äù.

She got royally pissed‚Ä¶ Also went off about how she took time to come help us and this is the appreciation she gets. :/ (which, is kinda true but she‚Äôs been making these small remarks here and there for a while).

Normally, I would have been better at holding my tongue, but honestly, at 8 am with 2-3 hours of sleep last night, it just slipped out.

Was I an AH for calling my MIL fat and pregnant?

Edit: she is hugely helpful, because she takes care of our baby from 7 am ish until 11 am/noon. So this gives me 4-5 hrs if solid uninterrupted sleep.

She kept insisting that I come with them but I just kept telling her that I just want to stay here. 

Eventually she asked why so I just told her the truth which was ‚ÄúI was going to wait for you guys to leave so I can go on a golf cart ride with my dad‚Äù and she was PISSED. She left the room and went outside followed by her son and my dad. Apparently she started crying and she thinks I hate her now.

I reminded her of our deal, so she told me that not letting the dog sleep on the bed was cruel and that dog beds must not be very comfortable and she just loves to cuddle with him so much. So I got up and she asked where I was going and I told her - I wasn't going to sleep with a dog that spent the better part of the day traipsing in dirt and stepping in shit and God knows what else and was going to drool on me and take up about 50% of the bed, so I was going to sleep somewhere else. 

So I slept on the floor in our kids' room. Come this morning, my wife is angry at me. She thinks that I behaved I'm maturely and childishly and that her request was harmless and the dog just wanted to cuddle.

He would light things on fire, cut people's hair while they slept, my mom and guests included, he'd put dirt in things and try to get people to eat them, put nails and sharp object in places and wait for people to ""find them"" . My mom was a single mother in her early twenties and had no idea how to care for him. So when he turned 11 and he had made a very disturbing attempt to burn down the shed she put him up for adoption and had him sent to a temporary home. At the time I was 4 and she said it was the hardest decision of her life but she knew I wasn't safe as long as he was around and she didn't want to live her life in fear of him. 

 He did get the help he needed and a two parent home that was able to put all their attention on him. He turned out to be a different person from his childhood and we reconnected over social media. We talk and he speaks to our mom on occasion but they still have a rocky relationship because my brother believes she gave up on him. 
We were discussing my pregnancy and he told me to be a better mom than ours and I told him I thought our mom did what was best. He was a difficult kid and she didn't have time or resources to help him and he turned out better.

My wife, ‚ÄúIrene,‚Äù is very fit.  She likes working out and has a proper exercise regime etc. She believes that if she ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù she ‚Äúlooks good,‚Äù and she feels good working out, so who am I to stop her? 

My brother, ‚ÄúWill,‚Äù spent the latter half of last year going through a messy divorce and now needs a place to stay. Though my brother and I aren‚Äôt very close, I figured he would only stay with us for a couple weeks until he got back on his feet. 

Will is a typical ‚Äúgym rat.‚Äù He‚Äôs always on a very strict diet, always working out and bragging about his ‚Äúgains.‚Äù I‚Äôve worked out with him a few times and he‚Äôs a little obnoxious. He‚Äôs always mad at you if you don‚Äôt work at his pace and is always trying to correct your form. He‚Äôs a pretty fit and muscular guy, but I don‚Äôt like to exercise with him. 

Will has been pushing Irene to  workout with him because, according to him, ‚Äúshe won‚Äôt be able to keep up with him.‚Äù Irene mostly just shrugs him off with a laugh and tells him she would love to workout with him. Irene works out in the mornings (3 times a week) and then does a run in the evening, but she‚Äôs been busy this past week and hasn‚Äôt been able to stick to her usual schedule. Will thinks that she‚Äôs making excuses because she doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù by him. Again, Irene just laughs him off. 

About two days ago, Irene and Will went on an early morning run. I didn‚Äôt go with them, but the first thing I heard when Will entered the house was, ‚ÄúThe only reason I couldn‚Äôt keep up with you (Irene) is because you were sweating too much.‚Äù I found this extremely comical, and kinda just laughed him off. Irene rolled her eyes and went to take a shower, so I thought that the conversation would die.

However, Will just kept bringing up my wife‚Äôs sweat.

My wife went to work and he told her, ‚Äúto make sure she doesn‚Äôt sweat through her clothes,‚Äù or when she called me in the middle of day, he yelled, ‚Äútell the sweaty bitch I said hi.‚Äù Of course, the bitch comment aggravated me and I told him to knock it off and stop acting like a child.

I thought that was the end of it, but he just kept going.  By the end of the day, I was tired of his comments, but Irene seemed rather unphased by them. When she served him food, he made a comment about her ‚Äúsweating into the food.‚Äù At this point, I was at my wits end and I told him to stop acting like a ‚Äúsore, slow (referring to his running pace) loser and eat his food.‚Äù Will, of course got angry, and said the only reason he was going slower than usual was because he was ‚Äúdistracted by my wife‚Äôs unhygienic sweat.‚Äù  Irene looked a bit offended by this, and I told Will that I would kick him out if he made another comment like that.

He‚Äôs been super pissed ever since. I jokingly told this story to a mutual friend and they agreed with Will. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh.

UPDATE: I didn't expect this amount of responses. Thank you for all the advice! 

I've decided to kick him out. He will be staying at a nearby hotel now.",1646415024.0

My coworker Bessie (mid 40s F) frequently uses an affected babyish way of talking, lisp and all, and laughing/maniacally giggling. This is annoying in itself, my other coworkers (all 40s-50s F) don‚Äôt like it but don‚Äôt say anything to her. 

The issue for me is that it is very high pitched. 

I ruptured both my eardrums when I was a kid (cause unknown) and I‚Äôve had a couple concussions (soccer goalkeeper through college), so I don‚Äôt know which is to blame but I am very sensitive to both very high pitched noises and very low bass. It‚Äôs a little odd to explain, but it‚Äôs like my inner ear area pulses/reverberates briefly which is extremely uncomfortable at best and then a lingering pain that goes away after a few moments.

Bessie‚Äôs baby voice and laugh have the effect of clapping great great grandmother‚Äôs best china plates together like a capuchin monkey. I cannot listen to music or otherwise shield myself at work since I spend most of my work day on the phone with insurance companies. I often have to ask the person on the other line to repeat themselves because whenever Bessie cackles I can‚Äôt hear anything for a few seconds. She does have a normal voice, she also has to talk on the phone as part of her job but otherwise it is incessant. Commenting on literally anything that happens (‚Äúkawen is going to da bafroooom!‚Äù), or talking loudly to herself in the hopes of someone indulging her. 

Today I was putting papers away in a filing cabinet in the back of the office near the bathrooms, about 50 feet away from where our cubicles are (very long and narrow building). I was bent over the lowest drawer when she snuck up on me and barely a foot away from my ear trilled ‚Äúpeekaboo!!!!!‚Äù and laughed. My ears immediately hurt, plus she startled me so I jerked my head up and smacked the back of my head on the handle of the drawer above me, which made her laugh even more. 

Once I stood up, I had my hands over my ears and I told her to quit acting like a squeaky toy, what the hell did she think she was doing sneaking up on me, and to leave me alone. She looked shocked but I didn‚Äôt see much as I turned and walked into to a bathroom. 

I was later told I didn‚Äôt exactly yell but I did raise my voice enough to be heard at the front, I thought I was speaking at a normal volume but then again I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. She left for the day after complaining to our manager that I both verbally harassed and attacked her. 

A few of my other coworkers said I was really mean to Bessie and that I should apologize, when I asked them if they really wanted her to continue talking like she did they didn‚Äôt have an answer.

My father owned a small bookstore in our hometown that I inherited recently. To be honest, the shop doesn't bring a lot of money and I already have a stable income.

Kevin found out and called for ""an urgent meeting"", He came over to my place and said he wanted to talk about the bookshop. I said what about it and he told me that now that the shop is officially mine then I should add his name on the title and split whatever profits I get 50/50, I was in shock I told him he had to be joking but he reminded me of when his dad passed away and left him inheritance money that he ended sharing with me, therefor I ""owe him"" half of my inheritance now. I didn't know what to say but I mentioned to him that yes, he did share his inheritance with me, but that was *while* we were married but now it's a different dynamic, And we no longer share anything. He got upset and argued that I technically owe him regardless of wether we're still together or not and urged me to consider because the money will be going towards the children anyway. We had a loud argument and I ended up saying that this will only happen in his dreams and telling him to wake up then told him to leave.

He tried to lash back but I insisted that he leave. He had his mother call me saying that I lied, decieved and stole from her son in the past and I owe him. Not just that but said that I should be rid of my pettiness and resentment towards Kevin and do the right thing for once. We founght on the phone and yesterday I was shocked when my 9 year old son called me a thief out of nowhere. This escalated the fight because Kevin got the kids involved.

I think that technically I do owe him because I can't deny that he shared his inheritance with me but..I think that now circumstances our different, Like when we used to share our salaries but now I don't expect him to do the same anymore obviously.

Still, I might be the delusional one so AITA?.

I‚Äôve been at my job for 2 years and my income is a pretty good amount. 

Fianc√©, let‚Äôs call him Tyler, works a minimum wage fast food job. I‚Äôve never brought up the income difference to him mainly because it doesn‚Äôt really matter who the bread winner is and he loves his job. Recently over the course of 4 months, he has been spending well above his means including some of my paychecks and even savings. 

I have two car payments, insurances, bills etc. which he does help with bills but not the cars because I believe they are my vehicles my responsibility. We live in a state where Marijuana is legal and that‚Äôs where most of the money is going. I‚Äôve tried keeping us afloat to no avail. I‚Äôve begged him to cut down on how much he buys and he always says he will but never does. We‚Äôve had multiple arguments regarding this. So far we‚Äôve had to move due to not being able to afford the rent due to said spending habits. 

We decided mutually it would be beneficial to move back in with our parents as to save money. I finally put my foot down when we lost our home and told him I was separating finances and access and that I would no longer be helping support his habit. He also recently lost his job due to his habit and not wanting to go to work so he is no longer contributing. 

He‚Äôs been begging me for money for his habit and I told him no. He called me a selfish asshole, went on about how I always brag about my pay (which I‚Äôve never done due to wanting to stay humble. I didn‚Äôt come from much and am trying to build a better life than what I had),and that he needed money for food, gas, etc. Now I have no problem helping him with necessary things as such but I know that whatever money I give him will go to his habit. I feel bad for not giving him anything and am wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole because what if he really does need it for said necessities, but Ive given him money in the past for that and it went to his habit.

What bugs me the most is when I said to wear darker pants she said ""I didn't know this shit was gonna happen"". When it's a monthly thing and she knew it was gonna be soon. And she said she was uncomfortable because of it and didn't want to ask other people.

Edit: For more clarification, I was not with her, she texted me while I was at lunch and she was in class.

I didn't tell her to be more prepared (the monthly part I said) because she knew it was coming, I added that to the Reddit post for context. Her classroom was across the ball from the nurse and I was in a different building, the nurse does have extra clothes and cleaning products for this situation. For the people saying wait until it happens to me, it already has but I didn't expect anyone to give me anything I just adjusted my backpack straps to cover more. Had I been with her it would have been a complete different story and I would have definitely let her borrow my hoodie for a short amount if time to walk to the nurses office to get situated.

My husband is a jokester, Sil complains about being on the recieving end of his pranks and jokes whenever they spent time together, She claimed that because of him, she lost her high school friends, her highschool sweetheart and lots of self esteem because his pranks wore her down emotionally and mentally.

He was joking of course, but things got out of hands and the party got cancelled. My SIL yelled at my husband and hasn't been speaking to him eversince.

She bluntly said she wasn't going to send him an invite to her wedding after he ruined her engagement but I thought that was excessive, first of all, it was a prank, a regular one that he pulls all the time and she and everyone else reacted over the top. and besides he already apologized multiple times and in my opinion, that should be enough for him to be granted some grace and forgiveness. She said sorry but she wasn't going to take a risk snd invite him so he'd ruin her wedding, and besides that her fiance does not feel comfortable having him there and she agreed with him. I was stunned I called her cruel because this is her brother, and he never had malicious intentions towards her yet, she keeps getting offended and oversensitive over everything he does, at the end of the day they're family. She asked that I respect her choice but I said that this is not okay seeing how sad her brother is because he doesn't wanna miss her wedding. She ended the call after saying she owes no one nothing. I found that real harsh and cruel and felt like she keeps punishing him over something that was in the past. My husband started crying when I told him about it, but there are actually some family members agreeing with her decision and telling me off for defending my husband's ""horrid"" attitude.",1646418585.0

t6pso9,AITA for denying my terminally ill ex-husband extended time with our daughter?,Not the A-hole,5380,0.97,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6pso9/aita_for_denying_my_terminally_ill_exhusband/,1012,"My ex and I got divorced three years ago. He was a good father to our daughter \[11F\]. But three years ago when my daughter was 8, he abruptly left with his affair partner, moving to an entirely new country and eventually having a baby with her. It was hard for my daughter, he didn‚Äôt really fight for custody and the rights he did have like visitation he didn‚Äôt really exercise. He went from being arguably her primary parent to short phone calls once a month *at best*.

He disclosed to me yesterday that a condition he's had for most of his life has become terminal. I was obviously devastated on his behalf. He wants our daughter to come to his country for a month to stay with him and his wife.

I am immensely sympathetic towards his situation, I truly am. But my daughter has spent three years adjusting to not having her father in her life in a meaningful way. I also remarried recently so that's been a huge adjustment. She's developing a relationship with her new stepdad and new family members on his side. I'm also 32 weeks pregnant. \[important later\]

Her dad has been ""too busy"" to visit since the divorce, he's made a few loose suggestions of taking her on 1:1 trips which I strongly encouraged but they've all died in the water because he's just ""too busy right now.""

If I'd asked my daughter before this if she wanted to visit with her dad, she'd say she did but she didn't want to interact with his new family. But obviously that's not really an option here. Of course, if I said this is the last time you'll be able to see your dad, she'd jump on a plane.

I suggested closer to a week and my ex balked and said a week was practically nothing and cruel on my part, and brought up how much he'd done for her in the first 8 years of her life and saying he deserved a longer goodbye.

But I'm not sure I can send my daughter to a strange country to spend a month with a father who bailed on her and a bunch of strangers. Even a week seems like a huge leap. He invited me to come but I reminded him I'm 32 weeks and can't travel. We don't have any other family to act as a more neutral ""chaperone."" He can't come here because his medical care is in his current location and of course his current wife and child are there and I'm sure he doesn't want to miss a minute with them either. But he can't just squeeze in our daughter where he can after not bothering to see her for three years.

And as I mentioned, this is a long standing medical condition that he *knew* would shorten his life and was something of a ticking time bomb, so while I can understand having a change of heart, he knew this day was coming and still chose to de-prioritize his relationship with our daughter.

**TL;DR: My ex, who was a loving parent before the divorce and an absentee parent post-divorce, is terminally ill. He wants our daughter to come stay with him for a month or so, knowing it will be the last time he gets to see her. AITA for not agreeing?**",1646419302.0

I (f37) need some unbiased opinions. My ex (m40 Mark*), never married, and his wife (Dana* f35 been together 10yrs) built a house about 6years ago. It is a 4bdrm, 2 living spaces, 2 bathrooms. The intention was for each of my kids (females 15, 14 and 12) to have their own rooms.  I have never liked Dana, she is strict about everything, breakfast  is at 7.30am and dinner at 7pm. She says this is because she has to drop the kids off at her parent's before she goes to work. I was told Dana couldn't get pregnant and I was ok with that, happy even. That meant my kids would be the sole focus for their Dad, but she wanted kids so I heard they tried IVF. 

Dana had twins, girl and boy, they are now 7years old. Dana and Mark decided that because they only have my kids two nights a month and for 1 week every school holidays, 2 weeks over Christmas ( I moved 4 hours away after Mark and I seperated) that the girl's could all share a single room. Before this the twins would sleep in Dana and Marks living space on a fold out lounge.

When I heard about this after my kids came back from holidays I was so angry. Dana explained that the room is a double bedroom and fits 3 single beds and a set of drawers for each girl, they have also placed room dividers between the beds for 'privacy'. She claimed that since the other two rooms are a bit smaller and the twins live there full time and have more items it made more sense. 

When I spoke to Mark he said that they are about to start building an 'add' on room attached to the second living space that will have another two bedrooms, but they will be a little smaller insize then the twins room. Mark got really angry when I told him the twins should be the ones staying in the added on rooms. My kids are getting treated like less than compared to Dana's kids.

I told my kids that until Mark and Dana agree to my suggestion I don't want to send them to their Dads. My kids are really angry, my eldest called me an asshole, and that they want to see their halfsiblings and 'family'. I am doing this for them but AITA in this situation?",1646473831.0
t7d5bh,AITA for not wanting to host or go to a party every single weekend?,,76,0.96,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7d5bh/aita_for_not_wanting_to_host_or_go_to_a_party/,67,"My partner and I are currently arguing because he just told me yesterday afternoon that he invited a bunch of friends over for dinner tonight. We had parties, either at our house or at a friend's house every weekend in February, and we had out of town guests staying with us on two of those weekends. I was really looking forward to a quiet weekend and catching up on some work (grading papers) that I need to do. Now I have to shop for food, clean the house, cook, entertain, and clean up afterwards. Basically, the whole weekend is now gone. When I ask him to help, before or after the party, he always says he's working overtime for extra money ""for us.""

For context, prior to the pandemic, we used to go out with friends on the weekends a lot. This didn't require so much preparation, cleaning and cooking. We could go out for a few hours and still have the rest of the weekend free. Now, since we don't really go to bars or restaurants anymore, my partner and our friends want to take turns having parties at each other's houses. I would be fine with this once or twice a month, but it has turned into every single weekend. I've tried to decline or let my partner go without me, but he won't because he drinks more than I do at these parties, so he wants me to drive. If I don't go, then I'm ruining his social outlet.

The other issue is that since New Year's I've been trying to lose weight. I'm eating healthier, exercising, and logging everything I eat in an app to stay on track. I've stuck with it and been modestly successful so far, but I know I could have lost at least twice as much by now if we weren't having parties every weekend. I've lost and gained back the same 2 lbs. at least 6 times since New Year's, and it's very frustrating. I do all this hard work throughout the week, and it's ruined every weekend. For example, one of my friends who's coming over tonight just texted me and said she'll bring French fries and a dessert for everyone. So, even though I'll make salmon, a veggie tray and a salad, there will be all sorts of other unhealthy foods as well. I can't expect everyone else to eat only what I'm eating.

I told my partner this, and he says, ""Just control yourself and don't eat or drink at the parties."" Well, some of our friends are ""food pushers"" (it's cultural). I can politely decline some delicious dish or dessert 50 times, but that 51st time they try to get me to eat it, I may give in.

If I start refusing to participate in all of these parties, AITA? I may be because I would be taking away my partner's social outlet, and our friends just want to spend time together.",1646497960.0

She's not fully recovered yet, however she has become healthier since going to therapy. Keep in mind through out the whole thing I was nothing less than supportive and I tried my best to help her in any way i could. I've personally never struggled with any major insecurities, however my body has been undergoing a lot of changes due to stress from school and other areas of my life, and because of this i've began binge eating, which has in turn affected my weight. My parents have been trying to save for some therapy, however they've not brought the topic up again and I dont want to bother them asking.

So the incident happened yesterday. I was making myself some food (as usual, adding much more than what i should eat) and my sister came in to make her food. The whole time i could see her looking at me with some sort of disgusted look, and after awhile it got really annoying and I asked if she wanted something. She told me she doesnt think I should be eating that much food because its already showing and if i dont stop soon i'm gonna regret it. I was shocked because it has always been a rule not to comment on each others bodies, and i guess i snapped because i said i'm not going to be taking advice from someone who hasnt even sorted through their ED yet and is still underweight. She started crying and my parents came in and i explained what happened. My mum began yelling at me that i was insensitive and Eve was just trying to help in her own way, however my dad said that Eve shouldnt have been commenting on my body anyway and he could see why i would react like that. There's been a little tension since because Eve has refused to come out of her room and my mum is blaming me for possibly making Eve relapse completely. I find it totally unfair though because I feel like she's putting Eve's mental health before mine. AITA?",1646505674.0

For example, one day we planned to meet and he was delayed by something which was fine, so I told him to take his time. Later, he was upset and told me that he expected me to ask him if he wanted me to cook lunch for him (we agreed to eat at our own homes beforehand). And said that I don't care about him which is not true. 

Another instance was when we went to a store because I needed peanut butter. He seemed upset after we left, so I asked him why. He stated that I should have asked him if he wanted to buy it as well. I explained that I knew he didn't like it, so I didn't ask, but he said I should have asked anyway. Finally, we went to a popular restaurant last night. He said the noise was making him irritated, which I didn't think was a huge issue. After the meal he told me that he expected me to ask him if he wanted to go somewhere else. At that time I didn't know he actually has a problem with loud noises. Needless to say, he was upset about it. 

I'm well aware that I need to do better but I feel like he expects me to read his mind and it just makes me feel bad that I can't meet his expectations.

She grew up around a lot of hurtful and oppressive ideas and while she does not believe in them, she gets super annoyed when westerns act at all surprised or taken aback. MIL and I have a decent relationship, but she is not a good grandmother as she really doesn't like kids. She has been showing slightly more interest in my kids since they got around middle school age. 

There is some complicated backstory but I'm going to try to sum it up. MIL is married to her stepbrother. She was always in love with him, but they used to bicker a lot as teens. She did want to marry him, but MIL played some prank on some girl she didn't like by locking her and the stepbrother in a closet, so people would gossip about the girls virginity. Stepbrother did the honorable thing and married the girl so her life wouldn't be ruined. MIL was devastated and was a nasty person for the first decade of her own son's life because she was so hung up over this guy.

He eventually divorced his wife and married MIL. MIL tried explaining this to my kids (13 and 15) and they just did not get it. Growing up in the US with liberal parents, they could not process this situation and why the stepbrother married someone he didn't love, why virginity was so important, why MIL went on to also marry someone she didn't love instead of becoming intendent, etc. MIL was getting annoyed and rolling her eyes. She tried explaining the other woman's life really could have been ruined and my kids were acting like MIL and this other woman should have just fought the system.

MIL got more and more condescending and then finally went to take something out of the oven and muttered what the fuck. I asked if she had a problem and she said I should just let her get annoyed. I sent the kids out of the room and said I didn't like her tone or her attitude.

MIL said she was concerned that my kids were a little dumb and she isn't saying the ideas in that country were right, but they need to educate themselves and maybe should ""read a book or something"" because she is concerned that they can't process.

I snapped at her that she is a shit grandmother and my kids are totally normal teens and maybe if she life wasn't such a shit show with banging her stepbrother and being a bully, they would get it. I said she shouldn't be calling anyone stupid when she knows nothing about kids and hardly raised her own. Needless to say she wasn't happy with me.

t6tzxc,AITA for confronting my brother's girlfriend about walking around the house naked,Asshole,1702,0.92,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6tzxc/aita_for_confronting_my_brothers_girlfriend_about/,907,"Throwaway because my brother and his girlfriend both use reddit.

A little background. My (M27) brother (M23) and his girlfriend (F23) all live together. They both lost their jobs from covid and rent is expensive so I offered to let them live with me. I own my house and they both pay rent. They have been great roommates except this one thing.

I am a little bit of a paranoid person and when I was renting out before, I bought a camera for my room to make sure no one goes in there. It is pointed at my door. I used to always leave my door closed but now that I rent to my brother and his gf I just leave it open because I trust them more.

I don't usually check the camera but a couple days ago out of curiosity I did and I saw my brother's gf walking down the hallway naked. I checked previous footage and saw her doing it all the time. I felt disgusting that she was walking around my home like that. So when she got home from work that day I confronted her about it and said that it was nasty seeing her naked and not to do it anymore. She was angry and asked how I knew she was walking around naked because she never does it when I'm home. I think this is probably true because I work a regular 9-5 and come home for lunch at the same time everyday. So she would know when I am home and when I'm not. But anyway I told her that I have a camera in my room and it saw her walking around naked almost every day. This made her even madder and she said she never would have done that if she knew I had a camera. She said it was like I was trying to see her naked on purpose.

Now this made me mad and I told her that if I saw her do it again I would reconsider letting her live here. She said what's the big deal if I'm not even home and to just take down the stupid camera. I told her that it's my house and my room and my rules and I can do whatever the hell I want. She stormed off after this and hasn't talked to me since.

I guess she texted my brother about it because when he got home he blew up at me. I thought I was in the right here but my brother and I always get along and now that he's mad at me I'm questioning if AITA.

EDIT: Since I am getting a LOT of comments about this I want to clear it up. The camera is in MY BEDROOM, NOT in any common area of the house, and I do not have any other cameras in any other areas of the house. The camera is pointed at my door so I could see who enters my room, and when my door is open it picks up a part of the hallway. I didn't even think about how it records the hallway because I haven't even checked it since they moved in until now. 

The reason I think it is gross that she's naked is because what if she is sitting on the furniture naked? Also she is basically my sister and it would be just as gross to see any of my other sisters naked. I went back to see the other footage because I would not have said anything if she just did it once or twice but her doing it all the time weirds me out. ",1646430912.0

 My ex in-laws were of no assistance when the bank was looking to reposes our home and take my parents home to cover the cost. 

I have sorted that all out as my ex husband just kept changing phone numbers and wouldn‚Äôt provide any address (again ex in-laws didn‚Äôt help) so it all fell to me to make sure my parents didn‚Äôt suffer any consequences and is now all sorted.

We noticed that in one of the spaces, (easiest to drive in/out of, closest to garage door&elevator, right next to the curb & is covered while nearly all the rest of the parking is open air) had 2-3 cars alternate parking there, so my wife asked about it & the girl Amy, in apartment #39 (owner of said space) was an international student who freed up the space when she went to work during term break. She didn‚Äôt care who used the space as long as she got it back during her schooling.¬†

Due to the big C, she hadn‚Äôt been able to return for a while, & in that time my wife had a baby. The autumn/winter was really wet so the neighbours kindly offered space #39 so my wife could park there with our newborn. Eventually it just became my wife‚Äôs parking space.¬†

So the issue is Amy came back while we were on a long weekend & we took my wife‚Äôs car, so obviously when we came back there was a car parked, but at the time we didn‚Äôt know it was Amy.

my wife had been leaving rude notes on the windshield, wanting to get Amy‚Äôs car towed for parking illegally and she was disrupting a young family‚Äôs routine, but she gave no name or apartment # so Amy had no idea who wrote them.

I saw my wife‚Äôs writing & my face must have made it obvious, coz Amy then said ‚Äúlook I know you have a young kid, but you got free reign when he was a little baby & it‚Äôs the only space I have, you‚Äôre gonna have to park your second car where the others do.‚Äù¬†

I showed my wife the notes, & she just said that she had been using the space for over a year & it should be deemed hers over a part-time resident, and had a right to fight for it. I didn‚Äôt agree as Amy legally owns it, & told her to just use our original space from now on, I‚Äôd park outside.

I tried to talk to her and she blew me off. Things don't run as efficiently or effectively as before. Whatever. My kids are 3rd and 5th graders so they're not going to be there long.

Over the course of the year, I saw a lot of the old staff disappear and a new person like every other month. 

My eldest son has Asperger's and ADHD so he has an aide (Mr. F) who had been with him since kindergarten. He told me that he was going to be leaving next week. I assumed he must of found another job.

The problem is that there‚Äôs 11 weeks till the wedding, and she hasn‚Äôt bought ANY thing for the event. Dresses, shoes, etc. The place the girls are getting the dresses takes 5 weeks for the dresses ti arrive, however because of high demand, they are taking 8 weeks to arrive. She won‚Äôt have funds for another 3 weeks, which means if the dress takes 8 weeks to arrive, her dress won‚Äôt arrive till the week of the wedding. She lives in Michigan, and the wedding is in Cali. I‚Äôm top of her indecisiveness, if she attends, I need to add another groomsman, however I can‚Äôt do that until I know she‚Äôs coming. Which I still don‚Äôt know if she will make it on time as a bridesmaid. So am I the asshole for wanting to tell her she can be a guest, but I cant have her as a bridesmaid?
**UPDATE** 
So I helped my sister this month with bills and gave her $500 to help out. But it seems she never put it towards bills as she asked me yesterday for $50 for the bill I have her money to pay. That was only for this month, not counting the hundreds I‚Äôd given her over the past few months. Ordinarily I would have bought her dress without hesitation. But because I‚Äôve given her so much already this month, on top of the fact I‚Äôm covering bridesmaids hotel rooms, the bachelorette party, and $100 gifts for them, (goes for groomsman too) I just no longer have the funds to help her buy the dress. The wedding is being paid out of pocket without the help of parents or friends.",1646508639.0
t6pzs1,AITA for not punishing my 7 year old son for mispronouncing the country‚ÄúNiger‚Äù at his birthday party?,Not the A-hole,2541,0.94,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6pzs1/aita_for_not_punishing_my_7_year_old_son_for/,541," My son recently turned 7 and we had a birthday party last week to celebrate. And honestly this is the first real birthday party he has had since the last 2 years there was Covid. In total combined with family and friends we had about 35 people at the party.  


During the party, my son was trying to pronounce the country ""Niger"" I believe it was on his Tik Tok feed. And when he said it, some of the other kids were like ohh, you just said the N-word. I heard it from the kitchen, my son was super nervous and started crying. I then pulled him upstairs and had a talk about it, said that its okay, that he made a mistake. And that he needs to be careful pronouncing words because the Nword causes a lot of people a lot of hurt and that he should never say it.  


Well, he went back downstairs and 10 minutes later he is out having fun again. One of the parents that was over, (They are White but adopted an African child) pull me aside and then tell me that am I not going to punish my son? I was like no, he didn't mean to say the n word he just mispronounced the country ""Niger."" They are like it doesn't matter how it got to that, that my son did something horrible and that he shouldn't be having fun right now, that he should be punished and then learn about why that word causes so many people so much harm. I was like he knows it hurts people, I reminded him that but his was a pronounciation mistake.   


They get very upset with me, and then take their son and say they are leaving our party and they also took back the gift they got my son. I was like okay. Am I wrong here for not punishing my son? I taught him why what he said could be hurtful but I don't see how a pronounciation mistake needs for me to cancel his birthday party.",1646419827.0

Also, I'm on mobile. Anyway, I'm supposed to be getting married early October 2022. It's not gonna be a big wedding or anything, but me and my fiance both have friends that we dont want to leave out. 

I have this friend (Amanda). We have known each other since highschool, and we arent incredibly close by any means but we are still somewhat good friends and hang out regularly and I would like her to be there. The problem is, I just recently found out who she is now dating and she wants to bring him as her plus one.

My sister (Lily) and her ex (Steve) broke up about 10 months ago, because she found out he was cheating. She was heartbroken, and I know along with that pain she still has a lot of resentment for him and doesnt even like hearing his name. He was a shit boyfriend so my family has no problem with him no longer being in our lives.  

8 months ago, Amanda told me she had started talking to someone and she really liked him and everything. She wouldnt tell me who, not even his name, because she said she didnt wanna share anything about him till it got more serious. I didnt really understand the secrecy, but didnt force her to tell me anything and just let her know I was happy for her and hope it all worked out.

Well last week, she told me she was dating Steve. They had gotten more serious and she wanted to make their relationship public to the people they care about. She also said she knew how much I disliked him and what he had done to my sister, and hoped I would try to understand their love and be happy for her and try to see him in a different light. I was a little shocked at first, since I really didnt expect her to be with a guy like him, and she knew what kind of person and boyfriend he was. But it isnt my place, and I told her that I'm happy shes happy, and that was that. Well two days later, we are texting about the wedding and everything and she mentions steve being her plus one. I do not want him there. Not only because I know my sister, who's my moh, doesnt want him there, but also because I dont like him and neither does my fiance. 

I immediately told her that Steve was not invited to the wedding. She was confused, and I explained to her that I was sorry, and I'm happy for her, but I didnt want him there. At first she thought it was just because my sister would be, and kept saying that they wouldnt even be near each other and it would be fine. But then i explained that with everything that happened,  we didnt want him there. I said sorry again, but she kept saying how I dont want her to be happy, how I just want to live in the past, how I want to punish her for finding love, stuff like that. None of that is true, and I tried to tell her that but she stopped responding.

So now I'm left feeling like a complete asshole and i dont know if i should just let steve come or not.",1646404842.0

We went to Disneyland for 2, Universal Studios for 1, and spent a day at the beach. This trip was supposed to be for kids between 14 and 22 years old with the 18-22 year olds chaperoning but they made an exception for 2 kids, a 13 year old who will be turning 14 a couple months after the trip and is pretty responsible and can take care of herself, and what was supposed to be another 13 year old about to turn 14. The second kid was really 8 and nobody found out until her mom dropped her off at church. By the time anyone realized she wasn't someone's sibling her mom was already gone. The priest was also there but he didn't really do anything.

They tried calling the kid's mom, who said she couldn't pick the kid up because she was on her way to the airport to go on vacation and that the kid's dad will be picking her up at the end of the trip. There wasn't a name or phone number for the dad on the paperwork and the kid said she didn't know her dad's number because he just got a new number. They ended up letting her go because there wasn't anyone to pick her up.

Basically, the way the trip worked was one of the 18-22 year olds would drive 2-3 14-17 year olds and we'd share a room at the hotel. I ended up sharing a car and room with both the 8 and 13 year olds and Emma (22). Emma's the oldest of 10 so she knows how to take care of kids and took care of the 8 year old the entire time but everything had to be child friendly all the time except after she'd go to bed the 13 year old would babysit so we could go out (we had a midnight curfew and the kid was in bed by 8).

I was talking to my friend and I said there's a little kid in the room and she's ruining the trip. Well, the kid heard me and wouldn't stop crying. Emma was pissed and said it's ok to feel that way but I can't say stuff like that in the room because she technically didn't do anything wrong and this is her mom's fault.

Things were pretty tense after that and Emma was a lot less cool after that so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",1646405159.0

A couple months back he told me to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù for literally nothing. Like I don‚Äôt even remember over what. I remember I wasn‚Äôt even fighting. Just teasing. He didn‚Äôt like my tone. 
Last night, he was busy with his friends all day so we hadn‚Äôt spoken. So, I was at work which was quite stressful as we had one of the patients who was at risk from herself . I came home late. He called me and by that time, I hadn‚Äôt even changed my work clothes as I had just reached. He asked me to come meet him and I said to him no. He sounded drunk. I changed topic many times and told him I had a busy shift. Then finally I said to him, I am tired and will talk to you tomorrow. Don‚Äôt feel well. This is while he is requesting me to go meet him. I agree I was getting annoyed and I was hungry and hadn‚Äôt eaten. I did mention to him about the client  situation. 
He told me to Fuck off. And hung up. I called him and I was like excuse me? He goes you are giving me attitude. Any person that gives me attitude can fuck off and so can you bitch. 
I was taken aback. I was like just because I said no? He said because you said no in attitude. 
I told him that he‚Äôs not some king that people who have achieved a lot more than him are more humble and he hasn‚Äôt even achieved much for having such an inflated ego. 
This is where I feel like I may be the AH. May be he was too drunk. Even then. Abuse is not okay. But I Atleast should‚Äôve controlled myself and talked when he was sober.

I think it shows a complete lack of respect for my time. I'm 27F and my BF of 5 years is going to be 28 in 2 days. I had made plans for a week long trip to Pennsylvania probably about a month ago. He was originally not going because he had a fishing trip but decided to a few days later. We live 19 hours away but were driving for the scenery, as there were places we wanted to see along the way.

We were due to leave on Friday, 2 weeks ago, around 11am. We packed up the night before and we were all ready to go. This man had 2 weeks to do last minute shit but instead of doing so, he chose to go see his moms new horse the morning we were supposed to leave. He didnt tell me this was his plan. He said he had to run errands but didnt say what. He left around like 8am that morning and said he would ""be right back"" but as you can imagine, he didnt come right back. His sister called me while he was at his parents (his sister still lives at home) and asks why I didnt come with my BF to say goodbye and I made a snarky comment saying ""probably because I had no idea he was going over there because we were supposed to leave the state by 11"". She just goes quiet (because it's already 2pm at this point) and says that my BF is out helping his father lay bedding down and get the stable ready for the new horse. 

I will admit that this truly pissed me off beyond belief. They had gotten that horse 3 days prior to this. He had plenty of time to help during those days and now he is taking away from MY vacation (the ONLY time I've ever been able to take a vacation). All of my stuff was in the vehicle so I couldnt even just leave and go by myself. Not saying I would have but the thought definitely crossed my mind once or twice. 

He finally got home that night around 8pm. I'm not going to start a trip at 8pm and not be able to see the sites I wanted to see along the way OR drive through the night OR pay extra for a hotel when I already had booked an AirBnB. He just wanted to leave right then but I refused and told him we wouldnt be in this position if he didnt selfishly fuck up my plans. It would have been one thing if the plans hadnt been set in stone but they were and they were thoroughly discussed numerous times. He says I'm an AH because all he did was go to his mothers house because she wanted to see him before he left and it wasnt his fault because his dad badgered him in to helping and wouldnt take no for an answer (his dad is super old fashioned). I still argued it's his fault that my trip was delayed by a day. AITA?",1646509947.0

We went to a local park - one that was meant for humans. Here, dogs must be leashed or otherwise under control - has good recall, not interested in other dogs/people, etc. Ever since an off leash dog bit mine about a year ago, I‚Äôve carried citronella spray with me. It is not harmful, yet dogs absolutely hate the smell. So it makes for a good deterrent.

As we were entering the general area, an off leash dog ran up to mine. The owner was not there. It was way larger than her - about 30 lbs maybe. I immediately picked my dog up. I don‚Äôt know if it was reactive, aggressive, or just excited, but it was continuing to jump up on me in an attempt to get to my dog. After the previous attack, I was extremely cautious about dogs like this. So I pulled out the spray and used it on the dog. It hated it, pawing at its eyes and immediately running away.   


About a minute later, it came back leashed, with an angry owner. He was yelling at me for spraying his precious puppy. I told him that it was illegal for it to be off leash and that this was done in self defense. He called me an entitled a-hole and that this wasn‚Äôt called for. That his pup was just trying to be friendly. He then walked away without even apologizing. As my dog was extremely traumatized after that encounter, I yelled back that he was just lucky I wasn‚Äôt reporting him to animal control.

&#x200B;

I talked about it with some friends a few days later. They are also dog owners. They said that I could have just found the owner, and that I didn‚Äôt need to do this. They also said that they never would have done this. I began to think that I might be the asshole.

I have a MIL who is a nightmare and who despises me. my husband has set boundaries and she has set some of her own, so it is a very low contact right now but of course he wanted his mom at the wedding.

I have an uncle ""John"" who is very good with women, good looking, super charismatic, and everyone loves him. My mom and I approached John before the wedding and asked if he would wrangle MIL if she needed it. MIL is kind of like a boy crazy teen, so we thought it might work. I didn't have too much faith because 90% of the time she does whatever she wants anyway, but my mom was convinced it would work.

The day of the wedding, MIL started her bullshit. She was being passive aggressive and snarky and bringing down the mood. So my mom grabbed John who found an excuse to come into the room. He struck up a conversation with MIL, removed her from the room, and then they fucking disappeared. 

When it was time for the ceremony everyone was calling and texting and MIL finally answered her son and said she wasn't feeling well. My mom got a hold of John who had a bunch of vague excuses and said he wouldn't be coming back that night. My husband powered through it but I could tell he was upset. 

I later found out they were both lying, which I suspected, and they went to the beach and she slept over his house. I was furious on behalf of my husband. My mom texted John like wtf and John claimed he did his job and MIL didn't ruin the wedding did she.

Well I saw both of them recently at a birthday dinner for my great grandmother. My husband made a snarky comment to MIL about who knew she was alive because no one has heard a peep from her since that night. MIL laughed it off and John said see he did a great job of distracting her and she hasn't bothered us at all.

I snapped at him that he is an asshole and he ruined everything, probably to get laid. I said even he can't be this dumb to not now what I meant by distract her and that he is the reason she missed her son's wedding. I did calm down because I didn't want to be yelling at my great grandmother's dinner. John accused me of being dumb and insecure.

She recently asked the lawyer to ask me if I would top up a savings account for my niece which my dad had started. She felt that since her son got a saving account from my parents at 18 her daughter should receive the same ammount when she was 18. She pitched the idea that she would put in half the money and I should contribute the other half. She offered to let me pay it up if I didn't have the money on hand. It was around ¬£5000 or $6600.

I told the lawyer no. I didn't elaborate because if you give her a reason she see it as a place to start negotations but I didn't feel this is my responsibility and I don't have the money, even paying it up would take a chunk of change which I don't have.

I had to text her today about getting rid of some of my parents furniture. She asked about the savings account and I told her no. She replied she was very dissappointed but she would pay her half and ask her son to spilt the difference with his sister.

I don't feel its her son's responsibility either, so the question is WIBTA if I reply that I am dissapointed that she is trying to pass her responsibilities firstly onto her sister but then even worse, onto her son.

Here's where I may be kind of the asshole. She wasn't going to be home so instead of eating what we had in the house, I stopped off at the butcher, got myself a really nice steak, and slapped it on the grill.

I was in the middle of enjoying it when she came home unexpectedly early because one of her friends wasn't feeling well and they all decided to go again another night.

I told her that I had in no way agreed to being vegetarian and I could eat a steak in my own home if I wanted to, especially when she wasn't there.  I was pissed off because she was interrupting my dinner that I'd been looking forward to.

The next day we went for a long drive, and we stopped as he was feeling very hungry. He said that he'd get out of the car and get everything. I told him I'd come to get my hair products, but he insisted I stay as he wanted to leave quickly. I told him some good shampoos and conditioners to look for that would work on my hair and he went off. He came back very quickly, and I asked him if he found anything, he said yes. A few hours later when we got back, I checked what he got and it was a shampoo. A shampoo that was for straight hair and would be way too harsh for mine. And no conditioner. And if you think I'm being dramatic, you should see what my hair looks like after using a harsh shampoo. And I didnt want to put my hair up into tight styles, so I was kinda mad. I asked him if he couldn't find anything else and he told me that he was super hungry and in a rush but didn't think it'd matter as we could just share this shampoo... I was pissed. I told him he was selfish and didnt speak to him much the rest of that day. He said he felt like treated him badly. AITA?",1646504296.0
t6kag2,AITA for not telling my mom about my viagra?,Not the A-hole,4993,0.97,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6kag2/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_about_my_viagra/,572,"For you guys to be able to give an accurate judgement, this story requires backstory. Let me start of by saying I love mom. My mom is awesome and I wish her no ill-will. However, my mom is nosy as fuck. Nosy. As. Fuck. 

When I was growing up, she was the typical read-your-diary, go-through-the-nightstand, read-your-texts kind of a mom. It was all kind of chalked up to, over protective parenting. The situation got unbearable for me in college. My freshman and sophomore year I went to community college and lived at home (my parents had just gotten divorced) and like many other males I was horny. In my horniness, I went to the doctor and found out that I had contracted the clap (an sexually transmitted disease for any foreigners in the thread, treatable). A bill or something like that came in the mail for me and not only did my mom open it and read it (and pay for it) but she told my family about it. How did I find out? At thanksgiving when my aunt brought it up at the dinner table in front of a bunch of other family members who then proceeded to lecture me about safe sex. 

Fast forward to today, I moved out after sophomore year and took a real step back from my family to figure out my life and where I wanted it to go. Went to pilot training, got on with an airline, life is good. My mom and I recently started slowly reconnecting and when I transferred base to my hometown, she offered to let me live in and use her house as my address because she now spends so much time with her boyfriend that she‚Äôs barely around. I would pay the bills, no rent, and I would put her on my flight benefits. Fair trade. 

Well, my girlfriend and I decided to try out an online product. It‚Äôs a honey that supposedly has low doses of viagra in it to, you know üëÄ it‚Äôs called a male supplement honey. Well, I got it delivered to the house but then flew back to back for like two weeks and didn‚Äôt make it home. Mid trip, I get angry calls and texts from my family saying that my mom went to the hospital thinking she was having a heart attack or tachycardia. Turns out my mom opened the mail, ate the honey, and was feeling the effects. Apparently I should have warned her that a box with *my name* on it was going to be coming with a perverted honey in it. Even my dad is siding with my mom and I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills. Am I the asshole for not telling her I got viagra sent to the house?

Edit: two things, I moved out and also, my mom went to the er but they discharged her. She got a little high blood pressure and that was it. Viagra isn‚Äôt fatal to women and there‚Äôs not enough in the honey. She just had a strong reaction to it and she so over the top that she decided to admit herself. She literally drove herself to the ER.",1646404475.0

My ex is convinced my fianc√© is only with me for money and the company. He has been insisting I ask him to sign a prenup beforehand to protect the company but I felt like it was insulting to him so I refused. However, my fianc√© has recently gotten more and more interested in the company and it‚Äôs causing tension between him and my ex.

In one of their recent fights, my ex told him he would need to sign a prenup before we got married. My fianc√© refused and asked my ex who he thought he was. My ex told him if he wasn't in it for the company, he would sign it, but my fianc√© continued to refuse so my ex took it as confirmation for his doubts. I never said anything while they were fighting because neither of them listen to me anyway and I didn‚Äôt like my fianc√©‚Äôs reaction to the idea of a prenup.

Once we went home, my fianc√© was angry at me for not sticking up for him or defending our relationship. He also got even angrier after I told him I thought my ex was right and we should sign a prenup.

About 3 years ago a massive bomb burst when I found out about $30k hidden debt. He incurred this debt to purchase more cryptocurrency and also give money to his parents who do not work...at this time his two siblings weren't helping at all and he couldn't either so he helped them on credit without my knowledge. We had just immigrated to a new country (AUS) a few months prior and I was pregnant with our second child. After this we agreed that he would pay his parents a set monthly amount which he could afford and nothing more. I repaid the debt and he took over about 70% of our day to day expenses since I moved to working part time after having baby no. 2. I am a corporate lawyer and always worked full time and paid most of our expenses but have cut back since having baby no. 2 and settling into a new country

We are comfortable financially and have overcome the issues of the past. He promised that there will be full transparency moving forward, but there has been no reason for me to ask to see anything until now: We are in the process of building a home and each agreed to save a set amount each month. I have saved my share (sometimes more) but its recently come to light that he has not been.

He earns a very good salary as a software testing manager so I just could not understand why. He is the spender between the two of us, so I asked that we go through his bank statements together to see where we could cut back on subscriptions etc. to help us reach our goals, but he refused saying that he does bot want to be policed and needs independence. 

I also know that his mother recently asked him for money again (he told me). His father passed away last year and she moved to the USA to be with his sister and has a job now, so he had stopped paying her the monthly amount as it was no longer necessary. He told me he has not given her money, but I doubt this since he does not want me to see his statements, and I did see on his computer screen (open whatsapp chats) that his sister sending him her banking details - very suspicious. When I asked he denied it and said that I just have to trust him. He has deleted all bank emails and changed his passwords. I am also worried that he may have bought more crypto or games (he is a pc gamer with an extensive Steam library).

I feel so powerless, I do not want to be this way - but in order for us to move forward and work together to achieve our financial goals, I think there should be full transparency. AITA?",1646445999.0

They all agreed to this and even asked that I bring my husband and my dog along before (I live the closest to this park) so they could meet the dog and then my husband could take the dog back home when it was time for the afternoon tea. (Dogs aren‚Äôt allowed in the cafe) and I even reminded them yesterday to please meet me at the train station entrance to the park at 11:30, again they said they would make it. 

I also told them my dog has a poorly paw but I would get the bus to the park with the dog and my husband so they could meet him anyway, minimising the dog‚Äôs time on his feet. Again they said that‚Äôs fine. 

Come the day of and no one showed up until 11:50 and none of them got up in time to take the train and had to take Ubers or get lifts which took them all to other areas of the park.

I recently joined a fitness center (FC). There are two pools, a lap pool with 4 lanes and a therapy pool.

The incident happened yesterday in the lap pool. I got in and went to the first lane, closest to the entrance. There was no one else in the pool at the time. I started my workout- just a breast stroke, using the black line as a guide. I'm not an Olympic athlete, but I enjoy swimming and I don't think I make a fool of myself in the pool.

8 or 9 laps later, I stood to take a break at the shallow end of the pool (goes from 3.5-5ft). There was now a 50-ish guy in the lane next to me. He tapped me on the shoulder and I jumped when he touched me. He told me to ""swim on the other side of the lane,"" away from him.

While I was trying to figure out what he meant and why, he said that I was ""weaving all over the place,"" and ""making it hard to concentrate"", because I was hitting the rope. I got red and flustered, I tried to respond but didn't say anything. He looked at me and goes, ""Well?!,"" sighed and took off down his lane.

I looked over at the lifeguard (LG) but she didn't look at me. I went back to my swim but I kept my head above water. Away from the guy, I tapped the rope and realized I couldn't hit the rope without knowing.

I swam to the shallow end and the guy was there again, in his lane, waiting. I ignored him. He said, ""Hey, I'm serious"" and I looked at him, told him there was no way I could have hit the rope or crossed into his lane. I said he could use another lane. He responded that I shouldn't use the pool if I didn't ""swim right.""

I was upset, so I got out of the pool, to go sit in the hot tub and calm down. I had to walk past the LG. I approached her to ask if she observed me and the guy in the pool. She said she saw us talking and asked what happened. I told her what the guy said and she said she didn't see me cross the lane line. I said thanks and went to go into the locker room, where the hot tub is located. As I turned I saw the guy get out and talk to LG. Whatever she said pissed him off. I went into the locker room and got in the hot tub.

A couple minutes later, the LG came in and was looking for someone. I figured it was me so I waved. She came over and said the guy had accused me of kicking him repeatedly and swearing at him.

I told her none of that is true and she agreed that hadn't seen me do anything wrong. She asked if I wanted to file a complaint, I said yes. I got out, dressed and went to the front desk, like LG said to do. I did a complaint form. The LG said that the manager would follow and give the guy a warning- 3 in 6 months means suspension. I thanked them and left.

But now, I am wondering if I should have responded differently. Is there some unknown rule I broke? Should I contact the manager and rescind my complaint?",1646451681.0

I own a Discord community server of 350k members, a few weeks ago someone sent me a DM about being interested in buying an ad.

We discussed some details, and I told them about how we had 350k members plus 20-30k members online daily, so the ad reach would've been good.

They told me they were willing to pay 300usd for the ad, and after a bit more discussion they were confident enough to send me the money.

Once I got the money, I post the ad (exactly as it was written by them) on the server, days passed and the ad wasn't very succesful as it didnt gave them many joins to their server (which was the point of the ad).

They message me again, telling me how I was a liar and  a scammer because the ad didn't do well because only a few hundred people joined, but with my member count it should have been more. They asked me for the money back but I refused because I had already sent our staff their share. 

We discussed some more, and I ended the conversation by saying that I did my part. I posted the ad, I made sure to mention the whole server so everyone would have a notification on the ad, etc. But thats about how far i can control things, i dont have power on people and cant force them to join a server if they aren't interested. The reach was there, but i guess it wasn't interesting enough for people to actually join.

I am a junior in highschool and my boyfriend(Craig), his friends and his ex (Ronnie) are all seniors. Craig and Ronnie dated for about 8 months a year ago. He told me that they decided that they were better off friends and then 4 months ago we started dating. Im going to be honest, i really dont like Ronnie but she claims that she likes me and ""that Craig and i work really well together."" Shes loud and annoying and i personally dont like how close her and Craig are, given their history. I have told Craig that their relationship makes me uncomfortable and he said that he wouldnt stop being friends with her and encouraged me to maybe try to see past their history as they are no longer together and he doesnt see Ronnie like that anymore.

So a couple days ago, Ronnie told our friend group this ""hilarious"" story about how she hung out with a couple stoners on Monday and they smoked weed at the park behind the school. Everyone thought it was really funny but i didnt. I think that its really irresponsible and illeagal. They shouldnt have done it and lots of other kids who have done that got in serious trouble, why shouldnt she? So a couple days ago I reported Ronnie and she was called to the front office and one of Craig's friends told me that apparently she got in a lot of trouble. I was told she was suspended for a week and a letter was sent to the University she was going to go to. 

Craig and his friends were really angry for Ronnie and said that she didnt deserve to now have her future comprimised. My friend who knew i reported her said that i should tell Craig because what i did was really shitty and i said that it didnt really matter that. Yesterday afternoon my friend told Craig and he was really mad at me and said that he never wanted to talk to me again and this was a petty bitchy thing to do.

So my parents, siblings, and I all live separately. My 2 siblings live close to each other, while I live close to our parents. Also, I live in the area where they are working, often do some other stuff, etc.

The problem I have is that they call to see me when they are already in the area. Visiting the parents, or finishing something up. They would call and be like ""hey, we are here why don't you come so we can see each other"" or ""hey, are you home we would drop by"". And when I ask ""When?"", they would be like ""Oh, we are already here"", or ""we are there in 10 minutes"". 

I already asked them not to do that, to at least tell me that they are planning on coming so I can organize. That didn't go as well and the ""problem"" continued. And when I say that I can't they are like ""oh, what is the reason"", ""what r u doing"", ""c'mon, leave that this will be brief"", etc.

I find this really annoying. Sometimes I have other plans, sometimes I just don't feel like getting ASAP ready and going out, or having someone come by. I am introverted by nature so that also has some effect on it, and that is why I need a 3rd party view on this.

Long story short: I've been volunteering at a Pet Hotel since November. In January my dad died and in February the owner of the hotel was attacked (and other things that happened in November)

We have both been very upset but since she suffered her thibg I've been managing the hotel, and acting as her choufeur, therapist and friend. She's applied to her private health insurance for paid leave, but at the same time I kept the hotel going.

Yesterday there was a confusion with some clients (on me, not dejecting blame) and we were at full doggie capacity + 3 small dogs is the various section (she has done this before, so I thought it was doable). She left yesterday afternoon some passive-agressive notes in the office for when I got back there to walk the doggies in the various section and wrote a post-it for her saying I didn't deserve passive aggressive notes for doing my best.

You see, I've been treating her like I treated my mom when dad died, I've taken her to appointments, made sure she took care of herself, getting her public mental health support, bought supplies for both her and the hotel, carrying EVERYWHERE the hotel's mobile phone, taking reservations, managing the place like it were mine and my name were on the line. I've been crying every day because I can't cope anymore.

Today, she came in the hotel and started scolding me for things I didn't even do, so I told her she had 2 options: trusting me, and that I want the best for the hotel and the animals; getting off of paid leave and get back to managing the hotel her way. She kept yelling at me and my fianc√© (who is volunteering to help me with the hotel) told her I've gone to infinitum and beyond and he is not letting her treat me like that because I was loud crying and hyperventilating.

She took the keys from me and told me not to come by anymore. I feel broken, a bad person, thinking about the doggies and how much I miss them. I'd love to keep working at the hotel, but I'm not up for being treated like crap. Fianc√© says her being a victim does not give her free way to misstreat me.

We're the only 4 women in the company and we have vent sessions after work sometimes. Its a super male dominated industry and frankly we have plenty to vent about. 

This day, I was telling my friends about a guy in upper management who sexually harassed me, felt me up, and how useless HR was, but then he was gonna get fired for being on coke at work. ... Yeah it's that kinda workplace, we're all job hunting. 

But anyway, I was saying ""this dumb wrinkly bitch has no fucking impulse control, like how the fuck does someone get into upper management if they can't even keep their hands off the f@ggy girls tits and keep his nasty old coke nail outta his nose at work? Bastard thinks he's like god's gift to women because he's got a classic car but his dick is prolly more cracked and chafed than his gear shift, with how he's got one hand down his pants in that stanky ass office half the day""  

(Just to clarify, I am gay and was referring to myself as f@ggy, as a way to make a point he'd done something so boneheaded as tried to come onto the gayest girl in the office, I'd never call another person a slur) 

My friends were laughing, and it seemed pretty chill, just a couple of girls venting about a douchebag at work. 

Then this big guy came up to us and said to cut out that language. I figured he meant the slur I used because I genuinely could see how someone could find that offensive if they didn't know I was referring to myself. So I said ""Sorry for using a slur, I didn't mean it in a homophobic way at all; I'm actually a lesbian and was using it as a jokey way to refer to myself... But I'd never say it about another person."" 

He seemed confused and said ""I don't care if you're a lesbian, you can't be cussing like that around kids"" 

I said ""Kids? This is a bar?"" 

He said that it is a beer garden, a family establishment where a whole family can hang out, and his wife and kids moved inside to tell the staff about my language."" 

I was getting bad vibes from this guy coming around for a confrontation when he'd also had the employees involved, like why come around if you're having an employee mediate? So I said ""okay take a step back dude, let's wait for the employees if they're coming to mediate this, I don't want any trouble"" 

He called me disrespectful and went to find an employee and I don't know what happened next because no employees came to talk to us and we didn't see him or his family come around us. I don't know if the employees just thought it wasn't a big deal because people going for drinks sometimes cuss, or if they didn't want to tell us off because we're regulars and tip well every week? 

But I'm wondering after that weird interaction...

t7dnir,AITA for asking my roommate if I can sleep in my own room?,,23,0.93,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7dnir/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_if_i_can_sleep_in_my/,36,"I (18M) am a freshman in college, and my roommate (19M, we'll call him Brad) is someone that I wasn't friends with, but knew in high school. We decided stay in a dorm room together because we didn't want to risk going random. He was nice enough in high school, but in college I saw him for who he really is. He makes so many racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, etc. jokes that even Archie Bunker would tell him to chill. He's an only child, and I don't think his parents adequately taught him how to live with someone. He never cleans out the microwave, has woken me up more times than I can count with lights and making noise, lets his crappy friends stay with little more than a few hours' notice (we both have lofted beds, and a futon beneath my bed), and generally doesn't have regard for the fact that it's OUR room, not just his. I've been cordial so far, but I'm at my limit.

When Brad asked about me leaving at 8pm Saturday night so he could have a girl over, I was initially fine with it, because I had time and options to stay elsewhere. Things changed when I found out that a) I have three pretty big exams back to back this coming week, and b) my best arrangements are positioned in a way that forces me to stay out of my own room for almost 24 hours, since I'd have to be in my friend's apartment by 3 because she has work, and it's likely this girl wouldn't be gone until well after noon on Sunday. Friday night, I texted Brad, saying that I was sorry for making him change his plans, but I would be coming back to the room at midnight instead of the next day like we planned. I felt bad for changing it so soon, but he has an entire day to make changes if necessary, he had 4 hours to himself in our room, and I would be 100% okay with the girl staying the night, so that all that has to change is that they don't start ""doing it"" while I'm asleep.

At first Brad thought I was joking, because I think he got used to pushing me around. When I confirmed that this was how I felt, he got pretty aggressive and started personally attacking me, so I hung up. All of my friends are defending my stance, saying it's outrageous to expect me to carve such a massive chunk out of my weekend so he can have a girl over, ESPECIALLY when I have three exams and I want to be as ready as possible by getting good sleep in advance. Plus, he rarely wakes up before noon on weekends, so there's no way I have a chance at even showering until tomorrow afternoon. His friends immediately started hounding me, saying I was being a c\*ckblocker. The part where I feel like an AH is that I didn't give him a lot of time to change things, but at the same time, 4 hours is plenty of time to do whatever you want in the dorm room, and I stressed that she can absolutely stay the night, she doesn't need to scramble for different sleeping arrangements, so not much is changing.

I'm currently sitting in Starbucks trying not to panic, and I'm cutting a LOT out, but AITA?

Edit: Thank you all so much for validating my feelings, I don't feel like I'm going crazy anymore. Side note, I've seen a lot of comments so far about moving rooms and/or getting my RA involved. I really don't want to cause more tension than there needs to be, but if he tries to pull anything, rest easy knowing I totally snitched to my RA. As for moving out, since there's only 9 weeks left to the semester, there's not much I can do to get him out or leave myself, which is fine. Only 51 more days with him, thank goodness; for next year, I already have plans to live with friends that I am completely sure won't screw me over like he has.",1646499379.0
t6h49s,AITA for asking my step mom to keep her kid from licking me?,Not the A-hole,5610,0.97,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6h49s/aita_for_asking_my_step_mom_to_keep_her_kid_from/,690,"My step mom, 37, got mad at me,20, for asking her to not allow her son, 5, to lick me. 
Some context, I have a bad phobia of other people's bodily fluids. My own blood doesn't freak me out but my sisters would. It's not bad enough for a panic attack but it is bad enough to where I have to leave the table to dry heave. My entire family knows this and takes great pleasure in making fun of me for this. They've never gone out of there way to show me anything that would trigger my phobia, just poking fun.
About two weeks ago, I was hanging out with my family and joking around. I'm not really sure what led up to this but my step mom, followed by my step siblings and dad, started encouraging the 5 year old to lick me. They laughed as he chased me around. He caught up to me and licked a big stripe on my shirt and I freaked out and pushed him back, it did startle him enough that he freaked out a bit to but it it didn't hurt him. He just wasn't expecting that reaction. I quickly showered, changed clothes, and came up and asked her to not let her child do that again. She got really upset and told me that I couldn't be around him if I couldn't handle it, and that I was no longer allowed around him until I could grow up. I told her that if I wasn't allowed around him anymore, I wouldn't babysit anymore. She got even more mad after that.
I have known my little brother for about 3.5 years at this point and have never had a problem with this and I don't think I would have if my family hadn't egged him on. At the same time, he is a kid, and I should've expected this at some point. My family says I should let it go and apologize. I don't think I'm wrong in being mad about this, but please tell me if I am.

Tldr: My step mom encouraged my little brother to lick me and got mad when I asked her to keep from doing that because of my phobia of bodily fluids.

Edit: 1. I agreed to babysit him a week later. I caved and wanted to make sure he wasn't freaked out by me pushing him. He didn't even remember it happened. Also, he didn't lick me, so definite growth.
2. I do live on my own but I live about an hour or so away. Home cooked food in college is pretty tempting.
3. Please stop telling me to hit the 5 year old. It wasn't a lot of you, but enough.
4. I'm pretty sure if I got a spray bottle, it would only encourage his idea about it being a game.
5. He's a good kid and has a buttload of empathy, it was just hard for him to understand that his family was talling him to do something wrong.
6. My parents are big proponents of covid being not that bad. They believe it was weaponized so the left could steal the election.",1646394103.0

We roomed together two years of college and after college we decided to get an apartment together. We've never had any issues and we have opposite schedules so were rarely home at the same time and its nice. 

Recently, there's been an issue with the wifi and we've been trying to get our provider come and fix it. Apparently there's a $75 fee to have someone come out so she preferred that we tried to fix it on our own first. Now, we're pretty close friends so I know all of her friends and we've all hung out on occasion, she games a lot so most of her friends are from playing games online. She explained to me that one of her friends was gonna come over and try to fix it for us, I said no problem that's fine.

So flash forward to last week and I got home early from work to see her male friend (33M) who I've never met before in our apartment alone trying to fix the wifi. At first I freaked out cause I had no idea who he was and he said he was her friend. When I asked how he got in he said he picked up her key from her at work and got in. I texted her saying that I was upset she didn't tell me he was going to be at the apartment alone, not to mention its a friend I've never met before. She told me they've been playing games online together for a year and he's harmless but I still told her that wasn't okay. She was upset that I was being so dramatic about it and I told her she's not allowed to have anyone over when she's not there. Still she was really upset saying he was just trying to do something nice for us and apparently she told him I was uncomfortable and now he doesn't like me as well.

While I understand her side, I don't know this guy and I feel uncomfortable having a random guy whose also 33 and much older than us alone in our apartment. Who knows he could've made a copy of the key or something or stolen things! But AITA for making such a big deal about it? We haven't talked in a week and she's had him sleep over several times just to spite me.

My husband also has other kids (17F and 15F), so i'm their stepmom, and I really enjoy having all the kids around.

I have pretty good relationships with both my kids and my stepdaughters. But recently, my 15 year old stepdaughter was being more quiet than usual. I mean, she's always been the one to talk less than everyone else, but this time I felt like she was upset or something. 

So, about a week ago, I had went up to her room and asked her if anything was wrong, and she just told me school was stressing her out and that was it. I didn't fully believe that, so I told her if there was anything wrong, she could talk to me about it whenever she felt like it then left her alone for a while. 

A few days after, after coming home, she asked if we could talk. I was really surprised she actually wanted to talk to me about whatever was bothering her, because she always wants to handle things on her own. We went to a part of the house where no one else was, and she ended up telling me about her actual mom. Apparently this has been an issue her whole life, but she was upset because her mom seems to love her sister more than her and a lot of things like that. I won't go too into detail (for privacy reasons) but apparently her mom is a pretty trashy parent. 

She seemed close to crying but then said how she sometimes wished that I was her real mom. I was glad to know that she thought of me in that way, but at the same time it was heartbreaking. Everyone deserves loving parents. I told her that if she wanted to consider me as her mom, then she could, because obviously her mother isn't cut out to be a parent. 

Not long after, my husband found out about our conversation and he told me ""my daughters have only ONE mom, you can't replace her."" Then he went on about how his ex is an amazing parent, and that it's not my job to be a mom to the girls. 

I know that I have no right saying anything bad about my husband's ex, and it probably wasn't a good idea to replace my stepdaughter's mom. This is my first time on the subreddit and I want someone to tell me if I'm the one in the wrong, so aita?",1646453803.0

So anyway I am the primary on the car as she needed to trade her old one in and get something safer for her and her child.  The agreement was that she will be on the car for 6 months to build her credit and get the payments lower, this was stated both verbally and written via text as well. So 6 months rolls around and she‚Äôs says she needs to get it refinanced. 
More time passes I start making comments about it and now we are finally at 8 months. 

I need to get a new car since mine  has become almost undeliverable. I start pressuring here hey we need to get on this on Monday, I text her that night she didn‚Äôt have time. I go over to here place Tuesday and start doing online applications for her while she just sits and plays on phone. Wednesday she basically gets denied for every one as her credit score is a 562. 

I tell her well at this point I found a car and am having them hold it because I need her off my credit. On Thursday I tell her her options are refinance with a co-signer, trade it in for a cheaper car or put a down payment of 1000 for a local credit union who will even lower the car payments. Neither of these options are good enough for her. 

Friday rolls around and I am getting stressed bc she won‚Äôt do anything. I message her again and tell her these options again. That I need her to do this today bc it‚Äôs been 8 months and we agreed on 6. I brought up that she had 8 months to build her credit and did nothing about it. Then she says she doesn‚Äôt mind helping me, but she isn‚Äôt going to drop everything to do this since she has to move out in a couple of months and that I need to calm myself.

I finally got got my degree, I got engaged and I was able to receive a credit for an apartment. My mum suggested to throw a party for family and friends to celebrate these events and I happily agreed, being sure it would be only for closest family and my friends. I spent lots of time in the kitchen but I like cooking so it wasn't really a big deal. My friends, brother and dad's siblings arrived, we started chatting and generally had a good time. Then my parents arrived and I found out my mom brought her cousin, Alexis (F 40-something) with her.

Mum and Alexis were very close as kids and young adults, basically raised together. However, since they grew up they weren't too close and as a result aunt Alexis was almost a stranger for me (so I figured my mum will not bring her at my party). Also, Alexis had an alcohol problem for some time (along with some other problems), though she attended therapy and was sober for few years at the time of the party. I was aware of Alexis past but I was sure since my mum bring her, she knew what she was doing. Also, at the time when they arrived there was already an open bottle of the wine at the table.

So, basically I greet them and the party continued. However, when I started pouring wine (for Alexis an non-alcohol soda) my aunt started to pout (I'm not sure if it is the word but it looked like that) and shortly after left. I was not thinking too much about that at the time, especially since as I said I am not too close with her.

But the next day my mum called me cruel and unconsidering for filling glasses with wine in front of my recovering from addiction aunt. Apparently Alexis got mad and told my mum I should be ashamed of myself. I told my mum that I wasn't even aware she is going to be there and anyway I wouldn't accomodate only to Alexis needs given there were like 10 other people at the party. Mum however says I should hide the alcohol right when a person with a problem entered the room.

I think I am not at fault here but I sort of have a guilty conscience. I may not be close with Alexis but I do not want her to start drinking again, too. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you for all your comments saying that I shouldn't call recovering alcoholics ""ex-alcoholics"". English isn't my first language and while I was aware of that nuance in my native tongue I didn't know how to put it in English. Thanks to you I learn something new every day! I'm sorry if I made someone uncomfortable by my incorrect use of terms. I cannot edit the title but I did my best to correct the post itself. ",1646400034.0
t7et22,AITA for going to a friends house without telling my GF first?,,14,0.86,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7et22/aita_for_going_to_a_friends_house_without_telling/,41,"Tldr: forgot to tell gf about spur of the moment plans, she got upset at me 

So I‚Äôm struggling to see how I‚Äôm in the wrong here. Some background: Me (22M) and my GF ‚ÄúM‚Äù (21f) have been together for 3.5 years. We are both seniors in college, basically neighbors (we live in apartments 1 minute away from each other), and planning on moving in together next year. 

The issue: on Friday M worked from 9-2, I didn‚Äôt have anything to do except a quick homework assignment. So I‚Äôm on the couch hanging out with my roommate (D) when my neighbor (N) and another of our friends (S) who lives ~5-10 minutes away walk in (D had forgot to tell me he invited them). That was around 1PM or so. At 1:30 someone said something about maybe going to S house but nothing more was said until probably 1:50 when S got up and said he was gonna go home and asked if everyone was coming. We all said yes, S left in his own car and everyone else started getting shoes and stuff on to go with me in my car. At 2:10 M calls and asks me what I‚Äôm doing, I said about to go to S house. When I said that she hung up on me mid sentence (she does this when someone says something that upsets her) then texts me saying I never tell her what I‚Äôm doing which is not true, last time me and friends went out I told her beforehand to double check that we didn‚Äôt have any plans (I am a forgetful person and have forgotten to say things like this in the past tho, however I have no problem with her knowing what I‚Äôm up to at any time if I forget to say and she asks). 

So I text her back and tell her I just told you what I‚Äôm doing, it‚Äôs not like this was my plans for today all along I had literally just decided to go 15 minutes before you called me. 

Basically she blows up on me that the fact I just now decided to go isn‚Äôt the point, I don‚Äôt care about her, and I never tell her things. 

I responded by saying why does it matter, why do you need to know everywhere I go, it‚Äôs not like we had plans to go do something today that I blew off, and we we hadn‚Äôt even talked that day since she left for work that morning. 

At this point we‚Äôve arrived at S house and she starts calling me. The first time she called me I picked up and she just started yelling at me so I hung up, that happened Once more before I started just ignoring her calls. I said I‚Äôm at a friends house I‚Äôm not gonna sit on the phone and be yelled at and she said fuck you we‚Äôre done then. I said you‚Äôre being ridiculous but whatever have fun with that and it‚Äôs the next morning and we haven‚Äôt talked since. 

I think I could potentially be the asshole here bc I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to always be letting each other know what we‚Äôre doing and I did forget to let her know, but I also think her reaction was completely uncalled for and she‚Äôs making a huge deal out of something that isn‚Äôt really that big of a deal. But AITA for not telling my Gf that I was going to a friends house?

EDIT THANKS FOR THE JUDGEMENT: Wanted to clear some things up that I forgot to say but might affect the story:

1. We do usually hang out after she gets off of work

2. M is struggling with an undiagnosed mental illness and this particular scenario is not an accurate representation of our 3.5 year relationship. 

3. M is on mood stabilizers and other ADD medication although we are not sure if ADD is what she actually has, and has a really short fuse if she forgets to take medication 

Update for anyone who actually gave a shit enough to read this far: no we aren‚Äôt breaking up right now, and this isn‚Äôt even an accurate description of 99.999% of the time we‚Äôve spent together. It basically came down to she was upset at my reaction after she first texted me, I was upset it even got to the point where I had to react in the first place. We‚Äôre working on it tho, I feel like I would agree most with the person who said ESH. Thanks again for the judgement.",1646502632.0

Apologizing for formatting, On mobile.


This took place last night while I was out with my boyfriend and his kids (6) & (4) for dinner at a restaurant. Now to give some context, My boyfriend is a single dad with 2 kids, the 6yo is an angel but the 4yo is constantly hyperactive and tends to do things that cause issues for kids and adults, My boyfriend never tries to decsicpline him or give out punishments (age propriate of course) resulting in his behavior getting worse. As the girlfriend, I'm obviously not allowed to intervene or have a say in how he raises his kids, as he says.


Anyways, so last night while we were sitting eating, my boyfriend's 4yo son kept moving in his seat and making a fuss, throwing forks/napkins on the floor than telling me to pick them up. I did this several times but got fed up and told him to please stop and eat his food since my boyfriend was staring at his phone the entire time. The 4yo got agitated and unexpectedly spit in my dish before I could begin to eat. I was flabbergasted, My boyfriend saw this and scolded his son into sitting down quietly. I was disgusted I pushed the dish away and was about to call for the waitress to cone take it but my boyfriend stopped me and asked what I was doing, I told him his kid just spit in my dish and I was going to replace it but he said I didn't need to and should just remove the portion where his son spat and eat the rest, I was beyond shocked and grossed out, I said no way I was going to eat from that dish and my boyfriend said there was no way he was going to pay for a replacement dish and *urged* me to just eat from this one. I said no and we started arguing. I said it was disrespectful and unhygenic to expect me to eat from that dish amd he accused me of messing up his budget for the week. I took my purse and went to the restroom. He started texting me saying that the kids noticed my attitude and that I'd better keep it together but I turned my phone off and walked out.

He followed me outside and the argument continued, He said I was overreacting and causing an issue for no reason at all, but I said he was basically pushing me to eat from a dish his kid spat in which wasn't okay or acceptable. He still said I overreacted and insisted I go back inside but I refused and went back to the apt. he came back with the kids later and picked an argument with me about ruining our time together as a family and making the kids feel uncomfortable. He also said that if I wanted a replacement dish then I should pay for it myself cause it's an expensive restaurant. and guilted me for expecting him to pay even though his kid spat in it. I said that his behavior made me feel disrespected but he said I overreactec and should've let it go instead.

He's been cold shouldering me still, and I'm.unsure of wether I really overreacted to what happened.",1646433014.0

We literally do everything together whatever hobby I take up she's suddenly interested in it and I can't go do it without her.
Every TV show I try to watch I can't watch unless she's there too.
When I try to walk out of a room to go get something I have to give her a hug/kiss otherwise she'll block the door, even when I go to the bathroom she comes in without warning to show me something or tell me something, I feel like I'm just stuck and don't have any freedom at all not to mention that she constantly grabs my crotch even tho I've asked her numerous time to not do it, I don't find it attractive and it just makes me feel bad about myself like I'm there for her use and nothing else.
So today out of frustration I bought a lock for the bathroom door to take back some privacy I know it's only 5 minutes each time but it's something to help me feel at ease that I have a boundary where she can't come into.
Since I bought it she hasn't been talking to me much and just said it was stupid to have one cause we don't need it but wouldn't listen to my reason for it.
So AITA for trying to set boundaries and personal space in my marriage?",1646505121.0

until we got to summer, when it started to get warmer this lady behind our house started to drink, she is a 70 yr old lady

during summer she will drink which is fine but the problem with that is she screams at  to shut off my parents bathroom light while my parents go to the bathroom

she has shown up at our door and started banging at the door at 11pm over 20 times she has threatened to call cps on me and my brother (11m) over 10 times she has tried to break in to our house over 5 times

She has also tried to kidnap me since we have moved here

The second to last incident she was screaming at my mom (39f) to shut out the light as she was going to the bathroom she threatened to call cps and the police. 

Thankfully i got her yelling on recording as we started to record her to show to the police as their is already a file number for her as we are not the first people that have encountered this 

The next day i was taking my dog for a walk around our neighbourhood when i passed her house she made small talk with me so i did as well than i started to ignore her as i kept walking she kept giving me nasty looks as i walked passed her house so i started to get upset

I kept saying how it wasn‚Äôt right for her to threaten cps on my brother and me for my mom going to the bathroom, she said that I‚Äôm to young to talk to her about it and that i shouldn‚Äôt be talking to her about that and that she had never said such a thing so i told her i had recording and went off on her she got embarrassed and went back into her house.

My (17) friend (16) is a reckless driver. She averages about 100mph, give or take. She‚Äôs told me before she does it because she likes the ‚Äúrush‚Äù it gives her. I‚Äôve told her that she‚Äôs putting other people at risk. She constantly assures me she only does it when ‚Äúno one is around,‚Äù but, at that speed, it‚Äôs hard to be fully aware of your surroundings. 

I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll hurt herself, or, worse, injure someone else. So far she hasn‚Äôt, and she (miraculously) has never been pulled over. But honestly I hope she does get pulled over, because I think it‚Äôs the wake up call she needs. 

It just shocks me how little empathy or compassion she seems to have for other people on the road. Also, she is usually. Inebriated. when she drives. One of our mutual friends constantly enables her and laughs like it‚Äôs funny. 

I want to tell her moms, but one is struggling with a life-threatening illness, so the other is constantly taking care of her. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is one of the biggest reason my friend is so reckless, but still. It makes it difficult to tell them and honestly I don‚Äôt know what they would even do about it. 

I want to contact law enforcement (non-emergency of course), but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs too far. I don‚Äôt want to overstep, but I also know that if she injures herself or others I‚Äôll regret not doing anything. Also, I don‚Äôt know what would happen if I do report her. I know her family can‚Äôt afford to pay a fine right now, and I don‚Äôt want her to go to jail or anything, but when I tell her my concerns she just ignores them and tries to convince me im overreacting.

For more info I am the owner of a big house (3bd, big kitchen, garden‚Ä¶) and Jane has a 2bd flat.

2 years ago my daughter Lila (21F) came back from the country she moved to with her mom when she and I separated. She was around 6 at the time. She lived with me for 6 months and when her BF (22M) rejoigned her they took a flat. He is not fluent in our language so finding a job was a little hard. They managed but I still decided to help them every month.

Jane has two kids, Kara (28F) and Tom (30M).

Kara is married and has two kids, she and her husband own a house. Tom is working on his PHD.

Around 4 months ago me and Jane decided to move together. We decided to rent a house. We wanted to have something new together and to have a clean start.

In the meantime because of the pandemic my daughter lost her job and 2 months ago she realised she was pregnant. 

Jane and I found a house to rent and we started the move two weeks ago. Jane put her flat to rent and after some thinking I decided to lend the house to my daugther. She and her BF live in a 1bd flat.

I don‚Äôt need the rent money and I give every month money to her. 

In this country she knows only me and my dad. She wasn‚Äôt able to go back to see her mother because of travel restriction. She is now young, without a job and pregnant. Her BF is working but he is also young and they are both scared and a little lost. So letting them stay in my now empty house seemed like an easy solution for me. They would have room for the baby, they don‚Äôt have to worry about rent and they will be able to save for the future. 

I am also proud and happy to help her and to see her trust me even if I didn‚Äôt see her a lot when she was growing up.

Now the issue is Jane. 

When I told her what I was planning to do with the house she got a little angry. She said she doesn‚Äôt understand why I took the decision alone. In her opinion i should have talked with her about it and we should have chosen together who to lend the house to. 

I got defensive and told her that it was my house so my choice. It aggraved things and she accused me of chosing my daugther over her kids. She thinks her daughter with 2 kids deserves my house more because theirs doesn‚Äôt have a garden and is smaller. She says my daughter dosen‚Äôt need something this big.

Honestly I don‚Äôt think I am in the wrong here, but some member of her family called me and said I was playing favoritism between the children.

One of my friends also told me i should have talked to my GF before taking a decision about my house. That couple needed to take decision together.",1646422700.0

To save some money on the invites, we used a website instead of the traditional paper invites, where you set up a page, and then send a link to the page to people. They can then search their name and tick if they are coming or not. 
I should also say, this is only for the wedding party. The ceremony is happening a week before the party, about 200 miles from home, just the two of us. We made this decision partly because we haven't got lots of money to spend on a wedding, and also because we knew there would be family drama over who sits where and does what in all of the wedding.
Most of my mums side of the family (but mainly my mum and sister) had a big falling out with my step sister, which resulted in my step sister having very little to do with my family, other than occasionally seeing her dad (my stepdad). I don't know all the details of the falling out, but from what I do know, it seemed quite petty, from both sides. It also didn't involve me, so I stayed out of it. Me and my fianc√©e decided to invite my step sister to the wedding party, since we haven't fallen out with her, and it didn't seem right to not send her an invite. I knew this wouldn't be what my family wanted but as it was our wedding, we decided to invite her anyway.
Due to the nature of the invites, you can see who else has been invited by searching their name and seeing if it comes up. I don't know who (I suspect my sister) but someone has searched my step sisters name and seen she has been invited. Both my mum and stepdad called and texted me over the next couple of days, trying to get me to not send the link to my stepsister as I hadnt sent it to her at this point. My mum said she doesn't want her there and thought it had nothing to do with my fianc√©e if my stepsister is invited or not, and my stepdad said we're not all a happy family, they don't want her there, and I am upsetting my mum, who already has a lot on her plate (my maternal grandad is currently in hospital having had an emergency operation to remove his large intestine, and my younger brother is in the middle of a mental health crisis. He also said if we invite her he will tell her she can't be there. There was some back and forth, and we decided to send the invite anyway. both mum and stepdad messaged and said they were disappointed in me and when did I stop being considerate. That they've sacrificed a lot to give me the best they could and to think about that. Brother and grandad were brought up again also. Stepdad said the situation is sorted now, and wanted me to reach out to my mum and basically apologise. We decided to wait a few hours before replying this time, so we could calm down a bit. We came to the decision that at this point in time, we don't want them at the wedding if this is their attitude towards us, and I told them this in the next text in which we explained why we are pissed off

We've been out in public before and she said ""At least I don't (what my condition is) unlike some"" and pointed her head straight at me.

This past Thursday, I had just gotten to work and it was around 3:45 pm. I was on one side of the yard, guarding a bridge that lead to the other side of the yard, where two of our children were testing boundaries.

I was called over by my coworker, and she told me that one of the children told her that she wasn't feeling well. I looked at the child, and she was very pale, crying, and overall looked sick to her stomach. I thought she was going to be sick, so I turned around to count how many children there were to see how many children I needed to take with me, when my coworker told me we had 11, so I only needed to take 3. I grabbed the closest two, and took the three of them inside. As I opened the door, a parent arrived for pickup.

While I was waiting for the child as she used the rest room , my supervisor asked how many kids I had and I told her three. She then ran back outside and told my coworker to count again. I didn't think much of it because ratio was constantly broke at my other job, and it was never a big deal. My supervisor came in the room a minute or so later and told me that we broke ratio and I needed to count next time.

I explained to her how my coworker told me I only needed to take three, and my main concern was the possibly sick child. She told me that ratio's were more important than a child getting sick, and then left.

Later that night, I was walking back from the front door after bringing a child to their parents and she was talking to my coworker about it. She said that she contacted our bosses and explained what happened from her perspective only, and they told her it wasn't that big of a deal, and it wasn't a serious occurrence. I re-explained what happened from my perspective, and that I didn't want to create a biohazard on the yard, especially when we had an Autistic child in our care that would definitely play in it (they'd done it before), and I was told I should have let the child get sick on her self and in front of everyone else because, once again, ratio's are more important than a sick child.

The next day, however, I came in around 1 to cover lunch breaks because we were short staffed. When the coworker I worked with the day before came back from her break, she told me that the supervisor had gone around gossiping about what happened to everyone else. Thankfully, everyone was on our side, but it still hurt.

Later that night, we were closing the centre together again, we were talking about how unfair it was, and my coworker told me that she had brought up concerns about the two children pushing boundaries and she brushed it off and said that she cared more about ratios than out of control children. Since she's told me that, I've considered emailing our bosses with our sides of the story and reporting her.

So, would I be the AH for reporting her?",1646509742.0

I also got her a pair of trainers (sneakers for you Americans), a nice dress blouse and some black dress trousers with dress shoes. Afterwords we got some McDonalds and I took her home.

When  we got her home we began to show my Brother and SIL the clothes she picked out and my SIL got upset with me asking why i'd bought her only ""Boys"" clothes, I told her it was what she liked and picked out, she said I should have gotten her at least some ""Nice"" clothes and pretty things, at least a dress for nicer times and I showed her the blouse and trousers I got for that reason but that didn't soothe her at all.

I asked them what the big deal was, she's a kid what does it matter if he's running about in jeans and t-shirts? but my SIL insists that my niece should have pretty clothes. 

My brother has told me in private my SIL is just upset as they can't afford to get her the stuff she'd normally pick out and she's lashing out and to not take it to heart but I told him that his daughter picked out the clothes and she's old enough to know if she doesn't like pretty ""Girly"" things. 

Am I the asshole in this scenario? I tried to do a good deed but it ended up blowing up in my face.

ETA: fixed a typo. Also for anyone curious I haven't given them the receipt as I suspect they'd just return it all and force her to get  bunch of girly clothes instead, the clothes were a gift to my niece and I told them if there are any issues/damages that need a return i'll handle it.",1646438813.0
t7c77b,WIBTA for ditching my boyfriend when he leaves me behind?,,17,0.87,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7c77b/wibta_for_ditching_my_boyfriend_when_he_leaves_me/,46,"I posted this previously a few days ago but I think I did it incorrectly my apologies this is my first time posting here.

Throw away because my boyfriend uses Reddit. I (25f) have mobility issues, while I don‚Äôt think that makes me too much slower of a walker (when walking with friends I keep up fine or at least my friends easily match my pace without making it noticeable) I am also very short with short legs so maybe I do walk slower than my very tall boyfriend (m29).

The past couple years he‚Äôs always been bad at leaving me behind but as my mobility issues worsen it‚Äôs gotten worse. He is incredibly supportive with my mobility issues but for some reason he keeps doing this. When walking together my boyfriend always out paces me and leaves me behind. Whether it‚Äôs while we are grocery shopping, out at the mall, down town at night, in a parking garage etc. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where it happens everywhere we go.

Every time we go out together he will end up at the end of the aisle while I‚Äôm still in the middle or start of the aisle. I will call his name ( and even sometimes call his phone to no answer because he just straight up wandered off) and he just keeps going. When I find him I remind him to be please remember that I have mobility issues and I have shorter legs so to please try to slow down or at least not leave me behind.

Despite me asking he will do it again every time. While it‚Äôs not a huge issue, I am an adult I can fend for myself in a grocery store, it hurts to get left behind when we were supposed to be doing something together. This has also happened in a variety of places I would rather not be alone (major city at night time etc.).

The past couple of times I‚Äôve started thinking about just ditching him temporarily (ie calling a taxi or a friend to take me home, or going to a completely different part of the store) so he knows how it feels or maybe even gets a bit worried. Would I be the asshole if the next time my boyfriend leaves me behind, I ditch him?

Reason I might be the asshole: I might scare him or this might be seen as a potentially childish response to the issue.

Edit: I just wanted to update and say thank you for all the replies I have been reading them and taking them to heart. I am going to sit him down again one last time and let him know I am tired of him wandering off, especially when it is somewhere dangerous and let him know how I‚Äôm feeling. The next time he does it I will remind him one last time and then get somewhere safe, go to the car and wait for him or call a cab.",1646495291.0

I've gone on a couple of dates with this guy (36M) and this past weekend he texted me to ask if he could come over in 20 mins because he just got some great ""special"" candy from the dispensary in our city (we live in a legal state). I said sure, but that 20 mins wouldn't give me enough time to get my apartment just right for his first time coming over, so hopefully he wouldn't mind. He said no problem.

I did a speed clean of the living room, just standard tidying stuff. One thing about the living room that I didn't even think of was the two blankets I have on top of the couch I always sit on. I have one long couch and one loveseat, and the loveseat is kind of where I post up every day. The two blankets I have on this couch are a crochet blanket from my grandmother I've had since I was a teenager, and a blanket from my undergrad school I bought after a traumatic event 8 years ago that I used to basically swaddle myself in when I was having trouble sleeping because of nightmares. Both blankets are super important to me and basically adult security blankets (I know this might sound pathetic, but whatever). I don't let anyone else use them, which usually isn't an issue since I live alone.

I sat on this couch and was working on my own crochet blanket when he came over. After a few minutes, I folded up my WIP blanket and put it down next to me. He stood up, said ""I'm cold, so I'm taking your blanket,"" picking up my WIP and accidentally unraveling some stitches when the hook fell out. I said ""actually, please don't, it's not finished and you'll rip out stitches. I'll get you another blanket."" He then said it wasn't a big deal, he'd take one from the couch. I said I'd really prefer to get him one from my guest room, and that I don't let anyone use those two. He said he'd prefer to just use those and that I was being ridiculous. I said it wasn't an option and went to grab one from the other room. I came back and he had wrapped himself in both blankets and was giggling while looking at me, with his fingers even sticking through some of the stitches in my grandma's blanket.

Trying to stay as calm as possible, I told him he had 5 seconds to give the blankets back and take the other one, or I'd be asking him to leave my apartment. He took the blankets off and stayed for another hour watching TV but was quiet and sulky the whole time. The next morning he texted me a very long text saying that me ""micromanaging"" blankets was extremely unattractive to him and he no longer wished to see me.

I'm torn because I feel like I was asking him a very simple thing and just setting a boundary, but I also know that to someone else it might come across as being too controlling and an AH move. I feel like he was being immature, but I also know it was sort of my fault for leaving them out and that I might seem like an AH.

ETA: I should clarify that when I told him he couldn't use them because I didn't let others use them, I did say that they had an important meaning to me. He was also sitting on the longer couch and I was on the loveseat. ",1646412862.0

I know she is doing us a favor, but I was raised in a family where people genuinely wanted to help each other and I'm still taken aback by how transitional my husband's family is. 

MIL is engaged and she is soooo clingy it's insane. I honestly don't know how this guy deals with her. She sometimes wakes him up multiple times at night for attention. I've heard him talk to her about how that needs to stop. MIL always laughs it off. Last night MIL screamed and it wore up my kids. It really freaked out the toddler and it took forever to get the baby back to sleep.

In the morning when my husband asked if she was ok MIL said she was fine, he was just tickling her. I was immediately annoyed. Her fianc√© said he has asked her not to wake him so many times, so payback. I pointed out that they woke my kids and they both shrugged it off. I kind of jokingly asked if MIL was going to keep waking him up. She said no but everyone else rolled their eyes, because really she probably will until she realizes he is serious. She doesn't do boundaries well.

I said nicely that I get they are playing around, but I have two little kids and her screaming did wake them and I was up a good part of the night. MIL said that it was his fault. Then said she felt bad but really it is her house and she can make noise whenever she wants to. I said that while I understand that it seems weird that she wouldn't care more about her grandkids sleeping than her right to scream.

MIL snapped at me that they aren't her kids and I'm trying to make her feel bad when she didn't do anything wrong. I said she was technically right and she owes us nothing and doesn't have to care about anyone, but maybe that is why she is afraid of being alone (she has never said she is afraid of it but holy hell is she clingy with this man) is because she knows she doesn't deserve love, if this is how she treats her own family.

Background: I (27F) have a childhood friend ‚ÄúJane‚Äù (28F) who has very little storage space at her apartment. My wife (29F) and I let Jane store stuff in our house since we have plenty of room. She has a key to access the house if she needs to fetch any of her things when we‚Äôre not home. 

My wife and I were fooling around on one of our tables two days ago, and she was nude. Jane, coming to pick up one of her things, walked in and saw. She had texted ahead to let us know, but I missed the notification ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Jane was very embarrassed and just started apologizing profusely and sprinted out with her package. I called Jane later to apologize and thought the situation was just embarrassing but kinda funny.

I (29M) often watch my cousins (13F, 11M and 10M). I love these kids like younger siblings, but their mom/my aunt, I'm not so fond of. At every family gathering, she berates me for not giving my parents grandchildren (I'm gay and not really up on the idea of parenting). That's not the point of this situation though. 

I took the kids to see The Batman (which I was hesitant because reviews said it wasn't for kids) but I have a hard enough time saying no to them so I agreed. Auntie is under this impression that because I work at the nearest theater screening the film that I can get all of them in for free. I've told her it only works for myself and one other, which I typically give to the 13yo since she's over the age limit for child price. 

Now, perhaps this is on me for spoiling them, but they all got a bunch of concessions, leaving a mess behind. I silently apologized to my co-workers, and paid for everything. I don't ask for compensation since I love 'em. 

They loved the movie. I was asleep (not the movie's fault, I was running on 2hrs of sleep). When it was done, the 10yo woke me and were ready to go but then I saw the 13yo leave behind her half full bucket of popcorn and shrug it off. It more or less went down like this:
Me: Aren't you going to throw that away?
13yo: Why? Isn't that why janitors are hired?
Me: Look around you. Don't you think you can at the very least help them out?
13yo: Are you going to pay me for it?
Me: No...
13yo: Then I don't see why I should. 

I don't bring up the fact that this is the last show and the morning person has to clean it. Morning person being me. The other two already threw their trash away. We got to my aunt's and 13yo tells her how I ""made them clean up after other people"". Aunt starts to yell at me but the 11yo gives her the truth. Aunt goes on to tell me to not raise her kids. This is where I probably should've backed off but I retort that someone should because she's doing a pretty shit job of it. 

At that moment, a cleaning worker came out of the bedrooms (this is a three bedroom house). I added that it's a wonder she can clean up after herself if she has a maid. I slipped the maid a tip, and that's when Auntie lost it. She shouted at me for making her look bad in front of her kids, how my ""better than everyone else"" attitude is why I can't find a relationship (truthfully, I don't want one right now), and that I'm leeching off my parents by not moving out (I actually live with my best friend and his girlfriend but I don't tell her everything). 

After I left, my phone started blowing up with texts from the extended family, calling me an AH and stuff about me being a ""terrible, ungrateful nephew"". I told my parents what happened and my mom (aunt's sister) said Auntie's doing what she does best, being a drama queen. My folks, bless them, are the ones who taught me to empathize with people working in customer service.

parents for the first time at their home (he still lives with
them) and I went there one more time this week. 
My bf cares very much about his parents
opinions, especially when it comes to his
moms.
Before meeting his parents he told me
about the things I should do with them
and the things I shouldn't. At first I was
ok because it would actually help me
knowing how to properly behave with
them but now I feel like he wants me to
follow a specific script.
And now I feel like I have to act like a
robot with them like my bf is
programming me to be the perfect
daughter in law for his parents.
For instance he tells me things like ‚ÄúAsk
my mom/my dad/my sister this specific
question‚Äù ‚Äúact this way with my sis‚Äù
And it‚Äôs starting to give me a headache.
Also he talks a lot to his mom so I know that everytime I leave their home, or simply when I‚Äôm not there, she made comments about me and how I am.

For instance; In my family, besides family events, we don't eat together so no need to dress the table. In my bf family they do this so in the processus I was participating but I was kinda lost and slow because I didn‚Äôt know what to bring from the kitchen.
So his mom told him I was kind of a passive person.

My bf keeps saying to me she has much more positive thoughts than negative ones about me but at the same time he tells me things that get me pressured like ‚ÄúI tell you the negative remarks she makes so you can improve yourself and show her you can take care of me because she wants to be sure about that‚Äù

According to my bf since it‚Äôs his family I have to listen the way he wants me to act with them. 
I agree he can give me directives but I really don‚Äôt like that I have to follow everything he says. It‚Äôs not natural. The fact that his mom has always something to say about me is also disconcerting. I‚Äôm not mad at her for worrying about his son but I‚Äôm starting to be mad at him because he‚Äôs letting her. He embellishes things by saying that‚Äôs that just the impressions she has on me but I actually feel like it is actually criticism and he doesn‚Äôt get that.
When it comes to my family the only things I told him was to speak, dress  and behave properly . I also told him that I expect him to gradually have a good relationships with my brothers. That‚Äôs all. 
Also my parents generally don‚Äôt comment on him. (I‚Äôll don‚Äôt let them anyway)

I just want to be more myself with his family, even if  it means they‚Äôll need more time to fully appreciate me but at least it will be authentic. I feel like my bf it‚Äôs so scared they don‚Äôt like me he doesn‚Äôt care if our relationship may become superficial and hypocritical.",1646505837.0

Snd also the baby sleeps in the bedroom next to it
 This made sense now. My landlord told me to just ask them to close it. My sister on the other hand says I'm being an insensitive AH for asking them to adjust their home for me. I thought it  would have been a reasonable request.

For a bit of backstory, a few months ago I got bad food poisoning while also suffering a miscarriage simultaneously so was quite poorly, and without going into too much detail one morning I simply couldn‚Äôt leave the bathroom, it was a school day and a friend of mine was picking them up for school/nursery due to me being so ill (husband is emergency services so couldn‚Äôt take the day off) I called down to stepdaughter and asked if she could just do some cereal for all of them and she happily did it.

She has taken it upon herself to do this every morning, I‚Äôve told her many times she doesn‚Äôt have to and I can do it now I‚Äôm better, but she‚Äôs told me she enjoys doing it in the morning and she likes being in charge of the cereal (she gives us a list of what cereal she wants us to buy every week now and we oblige)

The problem now comes from this past weekend, stepdaughter went to her bio mums house, she only goes about once every 3/4 months, and apparently she tried to make her and her brother cereal that morning and told her mum she has that responsibility at home, I got an angry phone call telling me I‚Äôm parentifying stepdaughter. I have never told her this is something she has to do, and I only asked her the once to help, I explained everything to her mum but she wouldn‚Äôt listen. She now calling me and asshole and posting all over her social media saying I‚Äôm using stepdaughter as another parent which I do not, the most she does is the breakfast and if I nip toilet I just ask if she can keep an eye on 3 year old for a minute.

I honestly never blamed them, it was in a time when nerves were high and they ended up finding comfort in religious devotion and alternative approaches to medicine.

Whilst I can't say I wasn't bitter about such when I became an atheist and got my jabs and mess somewhat late in life, I learnt that I can't really blame them because it's not like they did it out of malice.

But where I still have an objection is that my parents like to buy ""health products"" from friends and family who participate in multilevel marketing schemes, and they continue to do so after I explained how it's all a scam and literal nonsense.

Not too long ago my dad was beginning to have his usual seasonal allergies, which he tries to treat with drops of essential oils mixed with water. But this time he got a new blend of oils with a different formulation, and this time when he swallowed them, he began to have an allergic reaction, coughing hard and his face was turning red and struggling to breathe. I don't drive, and I offered to call an ambulance but my dad told me he would be fine and to call mom. I was worried shitless at this point, I just whipped out my phone and dialed 911 and told them what was happening, and an ambulance was dispatched and dad was taken to the ER.

About a day later we got a call from the hospital saying my dad was in stable condition but he had a severe allergic reaction to something in the oil, which will need further determination but he would be discharged soon. After that we picked up dad from the hospital.

Initially my dad was overjoyed to see us, but then during the car ride he began to lecture me about ""being impulsive"" and calling an ambulance instead of letting mom come to take him, or hiring an Uber instead, comparing my actions to other ""OCD impulses"" that have gotten me into trouble in the past.

I snapped then and there. I loudly told him to STFU and that anaphylaxis is no fucking joke, the difference between life and death could have been minutes or even seconds, that I did what any reasonable person would do and that I saved his life, he has NO right to berate me. He retorted by saying that I didn't save him, the doctors did, and that he could have died by contracting a MRSA infection in the hospital. At that point it just went into full on screaming and arguing and I can't remember anything when angry.

Even after that my dad continued to guilt me about it to the point where today I'm going to my sister's house after college because he tried to tell me that because I called an ambulance, I would pay for the uncovered portion of the ambulance ride, and I just hung up then and there.

But I'm honestly torn apart, and the issue has really divided my extended family. Some say I should have considered ambulance costs whilst others say I was justified in calling such, and I really don't know.",1646432246.0

We have two daughters together however one of our children passed away. Almost four years ago our 2 year old daughter Lily passed away unexpectedly. I won't go into detail how she died but it was a traumatizing experience. 3 months after she passed, my husband and I drifted apart. We started coping in unhealthy ways, drinking excessively and using other substances to numb the pain. Losing a child is the worst possible loss. I can't even describe the feeling. I decided to leave him and we went our separate ways. During this time we both sought other people. We both regret our actions and we know we were in the darkest of places. A few months pass and we decided to reconnect, forgive each other and start our relationship over. We both started working out, eating healthy, dating each other all over again, and using healthy coping skills. We were finally in a good place. He was working full time at a local restaurant and I was going to school for social work. A year passed and we decided to try to have another child and spring of 2021 we welcomed our beautiful daughter Amelia. This was such a bittersweet moment in our lives. We miss Lily so much and longed for her to be here to meet her sister. I also began feeling guilty and shameful after having Amelia. Anxiety started to creep in and I had to be with Amelia basically 24/7. Because of how Lily passed no one except close family was allowed to watch her and even this was hard for me. I am sorry I have to give the background of our lives in order to get the full picture. I am currently still in school and I will graduate this May with a degree in social work. My husband is a manager at a restaurant and was just promoted to a salary position. Anyone who has worked in a restaurant setting knows that it can be consumed with a toxic culture like going out after work and drinking excessively. For the most part, my husband does not go out often, maybe once or twice a month. However, recently it has been getting worse and sometimes he even drives home drunk. I feel as if he is making going out a priority over me and Amelia. Maybe he is going through something mentally that I am not aware of. I have mentioned therapy but he says he doesn't want to be told to do and he will do it when and if he wants to. I just started therapy and I think doing so will help me work through my trauma. I know he needs the same. I only want what is best for him. Yesterday we got into a huge argument about going out. He says he doesn't want to be told what to do and wants space. The argument escalated and then he said he was miserable and wants to separate, I was devastated. I left with Amelia to go on a walk. When I got back home he was gone. He said he was hitting golf balls and would be back eventually. Hours later I looked up his location because he would not call or text me back, I started to worry. Turns out he was at a bar and I knew that this couldn't be good. He was being short and cruel to me. I was so worried he was going to drive drunk or hurt himself. I stayed up all night tracking his location to make sure he was okay and where he was going. I know this behavior may seem toxic but I was so worried about him. He told me he was going to stay the night at his parent's house. Well, he never showed up. I looked up his location this morning and turns out he was at a female co-workers house. My heart sank. and my stomach turned. I was sick. I called him immediately and he turned his phone off. He eventually replied and said it wasn't what I thought. He said that he and his coworkers met up and decided to go to this girl's house and smoke. He said he was too messed up to drive so he slept in his car. I just don't believe him. I found that he snapped this girl often and sent a video of him playing a song. (his music is sacred and only shares it with a few people). He says nothing is going on or happened but I don't believe him. He is being so sneaky and cruel with the space he says he needs. At the end of the day, I am still his wife and deserve respect regardless of our situation. I don't know what to do. Should I believe him?

So this is a bit wacky. But you guys were right about honesty and I decided I was gonna go tell my dad. However right when I made it home I got a text from my girlfriend to go to see her in the hospital (she was getting discharged). So I rushed to the hospital. My mom called me on the way and I just had Siri send the response ""Lissa's in the university hospital we'll talk later"". Well I was let in the room with my gf and she told me that while she was fine they found out that she's pregnant.

Honestly I didn't know how to feel but seeing her smile just gave me an idea that it'll all be all right. So when she fell asleep I dunno I just waited outside trying to gather my thoughts and all I could think about was my sister's funeral. I dunno I felt like shit like she was a baby and what if that happens to mine? So I started crying and all those depressive thoughts came back. My mom came to the hospital and it was the first time she's left her house for anywhere but the gym or Starbucks and when she texted me I told her where I was. When she came she saw me crying outside the room. She thought it was bad news and just hugged me tight and sang me a song that she used to when I was small and then said stuff like it'll be okay, baby, it'll all be okay. I didn't stop crying but somehow told her Lissa's pregnant.

I said I don't know what to think and used it to broach the idea of therapy with my mom cause she knows what depression is like and I want working through my feelings about being a dad and having her in my life with her. I convinced her cause I just said I didn't want to lose her ever again no matter what my dad or my aunt say. She stayed with Lissa and me until she got discharged.

As for my aunt, she gave me an ultimatum to tell my dad or she will. So I got them together and laid the entire thing out from the shrooms to the pregnancy. I think my dad wanted to have a heart attack and my aunt wanted him to blow up at me like his face got so red but just said if I'm going to be a man he has to trust me to make my choices. That seemed to bother my aunt but she chilled.

We've only had like four sessions so far but it has been hard unpacking those feelings about my depression, how I felt when I was hospitalized or at my sister's funeral and how angry I was at my dad for never letting me see her and being a dad myself. It's been hard hearing how she thought she was a curse and I was better off without her and how she feels I shouldn't forgive her cause she deserves to be a spinster. But end of the day she's not a curse, she's my mom and I know she loves me and I want her in my life and my child's life.",1646415480.0

We work for different companies, network with different people, and pretty much only saw each other when it was time to go to sleep.  Most people don't know we're together because neither of us have a social media presence or talk about our personal lives that much. I primarily stuck with the people I knew from my office (Sarah and Marilyn) and a couple of other people that I knew from school. 

&nbsp;

One woman, Tiana (39/F) knew Marilyn and decided to stick close to our group, and she had a kind of mean girl attitude that I only remember from high school. Tiana is gorgeous and she knows it, and for some reason my existence seemed to personally offend her. It may be because I'm average-looking and plus-sized, she may have some personal beef with me that I don't know about, I don't know. But she would constantly make little passive-aggressive digs at me. About my hair-""I just love how you have a signature look and wear your hair in a bun every day with the little wispies"" (which are just frizz). About what I'm eating ""Those bread rolls looked so good but I was just stuffed after eating only half, do you want mine too?"" and she would do things like ask me to take a picture of her, Sarah, and Marilyn, or call the Uber for all of us and be the one to sit up front. (ETA: She wanted me to call the Uber and sit up front, and said that the three of them would fit nicely in the back).  Just little, subtle digs *all* conference.

&nbsp;

Before the closing cocktail reception we were in the bathroom freshening up, and Tiana started talking about a ""really attractive guy with green eyes"" at one of her sessions and my ears perked up. (ETA: When she continued talking about him I knew it was Tom). She said that she had talked to him briefly and thought there was some chemistry there, and said she was going to ask him out at the closing cocktail reception. I pretended not to know who she was talking about. I just nodded and smiled while she talked about how it was good they were the same age (ETA: because in her words age gap relationships are gross) and how she hadn't dated anyone in awhile and should shoot her shot.

&nbsp;

While we were at the cocktail reception I (from across the room) watched Tiana go over to Tom and start talking. Tom has told me that she complimented his eyes, said that she didn't see a ring on his finger, and asked if he had a girlfriend. He said ""Yes, Paula, she's actually here."" As I was moving through the crowd toward her and Tom,Tiana recovered and ran off, and Sarah has said that she immediately rounded her, Marilyn, and a couple of others up and started shit-talking me, and saying things like how she couldn't believe someone like Tom would date someone like me in the first place, etc. But Sarah has asked me to put this to Reddit because of how mortified and embarrassed Tiana was afterward, so I submit this for public consideration...AITA?",1646371005.0

We eventually got to the point where they started talking about a lot of the shit they've had to go through as women.

I agreed and said I'm very fortunate that I've only had one experience in my working life where I have experienced a form of sexism. They were curious so they asked about it.

The short version of the story is that, when I was 25 at a previous job, a female coworker who I really didn't know came up to me, and commented that I had put on some weight. Not only that, but she patted my stomach while doing so. I was really stunned in the moment and didn't react, but after I had composed my self, I told my Executive Director about it. He said he'd speak to my coworker about it, but that I should probably just let it go because her culture is just more intimate and physical.

When I finished telling my current coworkers this story, once of them, V, asked ""So where was the sexism? It doesn't seem to me like there was anything really there.""

I asked her what she meant and her response was ""Well it's not like you went through a super traumatic experience or anything.""

And I told her I knew I didn't, and that I was aware that this was nothing compared to the sexual harassment many women do go through, but I still felt it was a case of sexism. I said if the roles were reversed and I had patted the coworker's stomach and commented on her weight, I would have been severely disciplined, if not outright fired.

V got really huffy and aggressive saying that I had no idea what real sexism was like and that I had ""no right to act like the feminist you claim to be."" Before storming off and cursing me out under her breath.

I wasn't trying to say I had ever experienced anything remotely bad as what she or anyone else had, but I'm wondering if I really put my foot in my mouth by even bringing up the story in the first place.

Edit for clarity: I don't think what my coworker did was sexism or harassment, but rather my boss's reaction to just let it go.

Second Edit: Because a couple of people have asked, to my knowledge my former boss never reprimanded anyone for inappropriate behaviour, but I don‚Äôt know if that was because there were no complaints raised, or just because he didn‚Äôt respond properly. He was a very vocal about the Me Too movement when it started shortly after this interaction, which is why I felt he probably would have responded differently if the roles were reversed.

Also, V did understand that I thought it was my boss who had been sexists, not the coworker who patted me. My apologies for not making that more clear in the initial post.

Final Edit: Thank you all very much for the comments. It's clear that my largest mistake was assuming that my former boss would have treated the situation differently if the genders were reversed, when I had no proof that would have been the case. I'm glad I made the post because I had told that story the same way for a few years and no one every said anything about it, which is part of the reason V's reaction took me by surprise.

I plan to apologize to her after the weekend, to let her know I now see where I erred.",1646436748.0

My husband had his first child at 19 with a much older woman. He got pushed out of her life and while he wanted to fight for her in court, he got manipulated out of it because he was ""already uninvolved"". He did pay child support, but there were no visits and the mother left the state shortly after the child was born.

When the daughter was 17, the full story finally came out through federal agents coming to his door. He was floored by what the reality of the situation was and had always been. He was crushed by guilt and only wanted to help his daughter, but obviously, when you've lived a life where your version of teenage rebellion is working with federal agents to free yourself from your household, no normal family dynamic or rule is ever going to apply, so she has never been able to safely live with her father or anyone in the family.

He has been able to help her with the legal side of things including suing her mother. I'm not going to go into detail, but if it helps to illustrate the situation, her mother is legally required to pay her health insurance premiums for the rest of her life. Her grandparents on both sides helped by creating various trusts for her, and her father both put his own money into it and gave up any inheritance from his parents for her, as he should. She's not mentally or physically able to work full time, but with how things settled, she doesn't really need to.

My husband and I now had kids together, and his family comparatively don't do anything for our kids. On holidays, the grandparents and aunts all give his oldest gifts and give our kids dollar store presents if anything. They also visit his oldest often but only see ours on major holidays. 

The kids are now getting old enough to notice this, and they want to know why. I think they're far too young for the full truth. They aren't mature enough or old enough. My husband wants to tell them that it's because she suffered and they should be happy that they don't need it the way she does, but I don't think that's right either. While in this case my stepdaughter absolutely deserves the money and attention she gets from the family, I don't want to teach a moral value on money like that as a rule.

Out of nowhere my younger brother asked if any of us had a least favorite sibling. My two sisters and younger brother said no, but I said yes, since I was being honest and I didn‚Äôt think I would have to say who it was. However, after a lot of peer pressuring I finally gave in and said my younger sister was my least favorite. After that pretty much everything became awkward and I could tell that my younger sister was on the verge of tears. Since then we‚Äôve only talked like once to each other and that was because the kitchen sink was leaking towards the end of the winter break.

With this in mind, I lowered the toaster setting to ""2"", made my sandwich, and moved on with my day.

This morning my girlfriend goes to toast some frozen waffles and they come out still cold in the middle. She eventually figures out that this is because ""someone lowered the toaster setting to '2', it's supposed to stay at '3'!"". Then a (light-hearted) argument ensued and her point of view is that ""3 is the default setting. When you're done using the toaster at a different setting, always bring it back to 3"". My stance is that it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure the toaster matches their required setting for whatever they plan to do with it.

Well he used the position to flirt with several of the women at work and I could see them visibly uncomfortable.

I walked up to him and corrected him saying no I am the mechanic here your barely an apprentice.

One of my classes had a two-stage exam with an individual written portion and a group discussion (followed by a write-up) portion. I did my written exam in the accessibility room and went into class to join my assigned group (throughout the semester) for the discussion. 

One group member (21F) said ‚Äúso happy you decided to finally show up‚Äù. I ignored her and no one else commented and we started our discussion.

My aunt and uncle have been trying to a while now but finally had the infant. Before the infant was even born, they where weird about it. My uncle made some down right sexist comments if he had a girl. He said ""I don't want to have to deal with a girl man, I don't want to have to worry about her getting pregnant, or periods, or her getting an ""onlyfans,"" I just want a boy because they're easier to take care of"". Me and a couple other family members bit our tongues on this until the sex of the baby of the baby was revealed, a boy. I was kind of happy at this because I was worried my uncle was going to be one of those emotionally neglectful fathers, who only cares about their male children.

They started sending images of their baby in the hospital nursery showing their son next to a female baby saying he got a ""girlfriend"" and saying that he was a ""ladies man"". A majority of my family found no problem in this and some even went on to say it was ""cute"" and that it looked like he was ""flirting"" with the female baby. This didn't sit right with me and I said ""Isn't it a bit weird to call your newborn baby a ""ladies man"" and a ""pimp"". Most of my family members told me it was ""fine"" and that he was ""just trying to encourage his son to be a gentleman"".

Tonight I (22 white female) was having a birthday party for my Japanese born friend Hannah (19 female).

We ended up playing a game where each player will choose one of the players that fits the description on a card best. At the end of the game being bored I just whent through the whole stack and made piles of my personal choices for each card. 

One of my guests saw my actions and became curious so I pointed out whose stack was which. Several minutes later I am then accused of being racists and stereotyping Hannah by giving her the card ""most likely to cure cancer"" by Sasha (African /Asia American 26 female). 

I then whent on to explain that while I am aware of stereotypes that might make it seem that was the reason I chose her that was not it at all. I chose her because she had yet to choose a career path while everyone else in room was either entreprenurship, marketing, teaching, or journalism. 

I was then informed by Sasha she had an associates in a science related field and by that logic it should have been her chosen. My response was while she may have those credentials 1 her current career path is entrepreneurship (a bridal boutique) so the likelihood of her using that is lessened and while an associates does open up more opportunities than anyone else currently considering she had no intention of using or further education it became somewhat nulvoid. Then whent on to say combing that generally those who work in that field spend years in school and then researching, her career path was in a complete different direction, and that she has no current plans to work in a science related field. Due to those reasons I still stick with my original choice because Hannah is undecided who would have been given any card that does not relate to the prior mentioned fields.

Sasha seemed very upset by this choice and Hannah seemed confused about why this conversation had even become so heated. At the end of the night I just shut it down because we were only going in circles and becoming more agitated at each other. 

So was my choice really that bad? AITA?",1646476337.0

Also key, they have shares in the company and I don‚Äôt (despite being promised). 

The conflict: I start my day at exactly 9:00am and end it exactly at 5:00. I don‚Äôt work a minute over. I take my lunch from 12:30-1:30. I have in the last worked overtime, but this is very rare and only when there is an emergency situation so other people don‚Äôt have to fix the problem all by themselves. 

My parents works all hours of the day, barely takes lunch. They get very stressed. Today they called me both ‚Äòstupid‚Äô and ‚Äòlazy‚Äô for sticking to my contracted hours. Lazy because I don‚Äôt work longer and stupid because they view the extra hours as integral to my career development (this is not my chosen career path FYI). 

I don‚Äôt view the hours after 5:00pm as more important or better training the the 8 hours I worked before it. 

So Reddit AITA? Should I be more willing to work longer hours unpaid? Would this actually help me develop skills quicker?

Edit:

To clarify - my parents are 1 / 2 steps below the CEOs (they expect a large payout from the stocks in 3 years). 

We are both salaried employees - them obviously paid more, but I earn above minimum wage. Based in the UK. I work from home full-time and do not deal with any customers. I cannot get a different job (that would be WFH with the same pay for my age and experience).

Also my lunch break is flexible in the time I take/when I choose to take it. But normally if a meeting goes over lunch I will ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô on the missed break time. 

I do love my company and thank you everyone for the kind comments. I talked to my direct manager and they said it was not my responsibility and that they will happily take on anything that appears after 5:00 because they know I am always contactable (their words) when needed. 

I am going to continue working my hours but maybe not finish immediately at 5:00 if I‚Äôm in the middle of a task and it would take longer for someone else to pick up later.",1646400111.0

My oldest did her usual shoes off and of she went my youngest I obviously go into the baby bit with her. So there's a slight ramp up and a crawl space across to a slide so I was helping my daughter up the ramp and meeting her at the top of the slide to come down. There was a little boy there between 2-3. As far as I was aware unsupervised (mum was sat at a table). So this little boy seems drawn to my baby and starts crawling past her bopping her on the head. He does this a few times and I just say please be careful with her head shes only a baby. Very nicely very softly. Anyway play caries on and boy keeps making a beeline for my baby shes crawling up the ramp and he pushed in to her and clambered on. Then she was at the ramp again with me right behind her, boy makes a beeline for her again at this point shes sat on the ramp turned to face me. Boy crawls up next to her stares at her then with all his force pushes on her belly with his fists and keeps them there. I yelled out ""what are you doing"" so little boy then pulled his hands off my child and I picked her straight up. At this point the mum has took notice stood up and is screaming at me across the baby bit of how dare I speak to her son that way. Its not my place to shout at her son and I should of gone to her and she would of sorted it. 
Firstly. It was reaction to get the child off my baby without pulling the toddler off which wpuld of course been crossing a line!
Secondly. I wasn't aware who the mum was until she started screaming at me, turns out she was having a coffee and working from a table so I cant imagine paying that close attention to her son. 
The screaming and shouting continued I told her what happened.¬† She told me to get my husband down there as shes about to call hers to come down and ""sort this"" I said there is absolutely no need to call my husband what on earth would be the need for that.
I'm not great at arguing and of course I get all upset to which she called me pathetic and to grow up, I got my kids together and was trying to leave and my toddler seemed really upset and I decided I really didn't want to be ran put of the softplay so I decided to stay even though her husband was on his way. 
He got here and shes starts shouting at him about me and I just said if you want to talk about it sit down but not continuing arguing at a children's play centre. Anyway husband was quite reasonable and turns out didnt start shouting at me ect. To which the mum was a bit miffed at so when he left she started ringing round her mates shouting about how furious she was that some women has just screamed at her son.

About 6 years ago, we left the state where both sets of our parents/extended families lived for my husband's work about 7 hours‚Äô drive away.

For the last few years we have made the drive up to see family multiple times a year, opting to spend the most time with my husband's family. See, my parents are complete slobs and mild hoarders. They basically do not cull through their stuff like normal people do; they buy tons of random crap, junk up their garage and every surface with clutter no matter what. Also, they also do not clean. At all. My dad calls me a neurotic clean-freak (I'm not.) It got so bad that we had to limit visits because of the dust.

My Dad had hated moving back to their hometown when my Mom (68 F) insisted they do so in 2008. They made the choice in 2019 (but did not actually move until 2021) to move down to be near me. Though my husband suspects it was selfish, better chances for my Dad (72 M) to find work (as they're not very good with finances). My dad was fired during the pandemic, and my mom had been on disability for years from her accident, once they made that choice, I told them to begin going through their crap, throwing stuff out, listing stuff on Facebook Marketplace, etc. They were two unemployed people with a dog. They did literally none of that.

Their move was a complete nightmare (an extremely long story) and dramafest for us all. I am disappointed in the way my father treated me while he stayed north emptying their house. Mom got partially moved in,  with Dad to be down with the rest. Every time I talked to my Dad, he would scream and yell. Somehow, he could not even TALK. I felt myself losing my affection for him. I was pregnant doing everything in my power to help them. The entire situation was so infuriating, because I had tried SO HARD, dedicated so much of my time and energy to help, touring homes, helping them pack, offering them advice, paying for stuff, etc. But here I was feeling like the enemy. It was terrible and Mom just made excuses for him ""this is very stressful for him"".

Once they were down here and my daughter was born, they only came to visit the baby, never help which is disappointing.

Mom makes comments about wanting to spend more time with the baby, but the only thing she does is sit down, put her feet up and hold the baby. She has no clue about baby's comfort so the baby doesn‚Äôt even have fun.

t7385s,AITA for making a joke about my step son's girlfriend?,,53,0.67,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7385s/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_step_sons/,102," 

My (57M) wife (54F) had two children before we met, the relevant one for this story is Josh (26M). My wife and I have been together for a long time so Ive known Josh since he was very young. He has had a rough childhood, he suffers from autism, had an eating disorder and is transgender. Josh doesnt have a bachelors and is pursuing the arts while working. To be honest, while he's grown into a fine young man, he is quite short, and still has a lot of ""feminine"" features, and is quite socially awkward.

I was surprised when before our latest family dinner, he says he is bringing home a girlfriend for us to meet, and even more surprised when he brings in Eva (24F). Eva was not what I expected. She is gorgeous, very feminine, goes to a top grad school in our area, has a very good part-time job a reputable company, very sociable, bubbly and all. I was honestly shocked, and I joked about this to Eva who laughed along. I made sure to also compliment her so she would feel accepted and know I didn't have any hard feelings.

Dinner is in full swing, and the conversation turns back to Eva. She was talking about a funny situation at work that had the whole table laughing. As she wraps up the story, I say something like ""if you weren't so successful I'd assume you were a gold digger .... I guess you might still be an escort though!"" To be fair, our family is quite wealthy and I really don't think calling a girl successful is an insult. I also don't think the joke was that offensive. But both her and especially Josh seemed very uncomfortable, and Eva didn't speak to me the rest of the night, and they left early. A few people came up to me to say that it wasn't an appropriate joke and that I was an asshole, but my wife and I both think it was a bit of harmless fun, and that they're being a bit too sensitive. My step-son has been ignoring my texts and calls. AITA for making that joke?",1646461166.0
t7h2gr,AITA for considering going on vacation during my husband's 40th birthday,,4,0.83,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7h2gr/aita_for_considering_going_on_vacation_during_my/,12,"Prior to COVID my mother in law would travel abroad with a group of her friends about once a year. Due to COVID she has not been able to see this group for almost 3 years as they all live in different cities. About 1 week ago my MIL gets an invitation to travel abroad this September with this same group of friends.  The dates of the trip coincide with my husband's 40th birthday, and the dates are not flexible as my MIL's friend has already booked a tour. My MIL knows that I enjoy traveling so she invited me to join. To be honest this particular trip did not interest me much so I was likely going to turn her down, but since she was nice enough to invite me I thought it would be reasonable to have a discussion about it. Today I went out to lunch with my MIL and my husband. I decided to bring up the trip in conversation. As soon as I mentioned the dates of the trip my husband says ""you are an a-hole for even considering going on this trip during my birthday"" as he feels that he only gets one 40th birthday. My husband has never been the type of person to have a big party. I asked him what he would like to do for his birthday and he said he would like to go out to a nice dinner with just me and maybe MIL. I tried to explain that we could go out to dinner a different week but he insists that if I am not in town on the exact day of his birthday it would make me a huge A-hole. I asked him if he would be mad if just his MIL goes on the trip and at first he said ""she should feel guilty for missing my B-day"" but later he said that he would be ok with her going without me. Last year I also went on a trip in September but my flight arrived back in town 1 day prior to his actual birthday and we did go out to dinner on his actual birthday. The way I see it is that unless he is planning a big party it shouldn't matter if I am out of town on his birthday as we could always celebrate a different day.  I also don't think he should try to guilt his MIL out of seeing her friends for the first time in 3 years.",1646509131.0

He works full time 5 days a week on shifts 6am-2pm and 2pm-10pm alternate weeks, and I work 2 days a week 8-4pm whilst I am a SAHM the rest of the time(can't afford full time childcare at over ¬£1000 a month.) 

I expect to do alot more with the baby as I'm off more but it's getting to me now. I do all of her bottles, nappy changes, feed her breakfast/lunch/tea, get her dressed and undressed, get up with her in the night. When I come home from work, I take over and he relaxes, when he gets home from work he relaxes and I'm still doing everything in the day. I also cook all our meals and do all the chores, dishes, hoovering, mopping etc,I also bathe her every other night too which he never does. He does do some tidying because he's a clean person but I also do it in the day so there's really not much to do, no dishes left, no mess. One thing he does do is washing the clothes which I don't but that's it. Because he's up at 6am on one week I don't expect him to get up with the baby, but he has lie ins till 11am on the other week and I still get up with her if she cries in the night. The only time he does these things is the weekend I work(every other weekend) because well he has to. I feel largely unsupported. If I ever ask for a nap for an hour he goes silent, and just nods his head. He wouldn't outrightly say no you can't, but I then always feel guilty about wanting a rest.

I'm still angry over a few weeks ago. I was very ill, vomiting and diarrhea for 7 full days (I've only ever thrown up for max two days) and was in a bad way. He still went to a football match from in the morning till 4pm without asking me or even telling me I won't go. He was in work so I had to look after her, he took over when he was home for roughly three hours but would still wake me up and I'd be doing her tea, nappies, getting up with her. I also had covid and did the same.

I'm also in my last trimester of pregnancy and completely exhausted. He is a wonderful man in every other way, just not when it comes to looking after the baby. AITA for wanting to talk to him about stepping up more?",1646508807.0

He got very upset about it, claiming that the concept of ""girls night"" is inherently sexist and rude. His reasoning was that if he enjoys everything that girls enjoy, the only reason he wouldn't be invited is because he is a guy, and that is, by definition, sexist.

He then asked me directly why he specifically wouldn't be invited. I told him that him being there would change the vibe, and he asked me how. Honestly, I couldn't think of any specific reason *why* or *how* it would change the vibe ‚Äî I've never thought about that before ‚Äî so I told him *it just would*. That only made him more upset.

He told me I was being rude and exclusive. I had no idea what to say. I don't know if I'm just flustered or if he has a good point. I have never known anybody to take offense to ""guys night"" or ""girls night"" before. I suppose, by definition, it is an exclusive event in the sense that you must be a girl to participate. At the same time... Though I cannot explain how, I do know that having a guy at ""girls night"" would change the dynamic completely, and my friends would not enjoy it as much.

t7gu50,WIBTA for moving out,,4,1.0,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t7gu50/wibta_for_moving_out/,17," 

Hi, sorry if Im doing this wrong, its my first time here and Im not a native speaker.

Context: I (22) am still living with my Mom and Sister (17). My big Brother (30) did move out years ago. I am currently learning to become nurse in Germany (One year to go).

I help much around the house, practically I organise and do nearly everything around here. And its hard, I am already under stress and I cant really relax at home or have time for myself. I find myself not wanting to come home.

A few days ago my big Brother told me about a collegue who wants to rent out his upperfloor. Maybe its too big for me, but its really cheap. Even cheaper than most smaller ones. It would be closer to my brother and the same distance from work. And even if its cheap will it be hard, cause I dont get that much salary. But I think I could make it work.

When I told my Mom about the flat she startet to list reasons why not to go. That I couldnt afford it, that I cant live alone and so on. She told me that I should stay for a few more years. She didnt even let me think on my own, didnt even give it up for debate. Just said why I shouldnt do it and closed the case. My Mom gets money because Im still in trainig and because my father is dead, I think she wants me to stay to keep the money, but I would most likely let her keep it. Another reason would be that the household would most likely crash and burn without me. She says I would be an asshole for abondoning them

I really wanna move out, living here is hard on me, mostly psychological. What if she wont talk to me if I decide to move out? Her way of dealing with fighting is crying and calling herself a bad mother. I dont want her to be sad. What if I dont make it, if I cant live on my own? Im really scared. Then it would all be for nothing.

My brother and his partner think Im in the right for wanting to leave, but my sister thinks I am an asshole for bringing it up.

So would I be the asshole for moving out?",1646508458.0

Our waiter was very cute and energetic. Not only did he do a great job, he was also very friendly and we all found him adorable. I was more vocal about this than my friends - I wasn't over the top or creepy, I just told him he was cute and doing a great job.   
   
Afterwards a couple of my friends said I shouldn't have said those things - they thought it was ""patronising"" and pointed out how creepy it would have been if our genders were reversed. I disagree, I wasn't hitting on him - he's cute but much younger and based on his mannerisms I'm pretty sure he's gay. I wasn't attracted to him, I just found him very charming and I was happy with how he was doing his job, he gave us a great experience. Yes i left him a good tip.

t6mces,AITA for getting upset with my husband for hiring a cleaning service?,Not the A-hole,589,0.94,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6mces/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_husband_for_hiring/,269,"So this has been on my mind for a while, and I genuinely can‚Äôt see if I‚Äôm in the wrong/overreacting. 

My (33F) husband (34M) struggles to consistently help out around the house. We both have full time jobs and no kids, but both our jobs are well over 40 hours a week and require a lot of nights and weekends. Because of this, we try to clean/do things around the house when we can fit it in, and it‚Äôs usually not at the same time as each other. 

The only thing he will do consistently is the dishes, which I really appreciate. But when it comes to the rest of the house, I end up doing everything! We have a lot of pets so the house needs constant vacuuming and mopping. I bring this up to him allll the time and he promises to get better, but three days later he‚Äôs back to doing nothing. He will frequently use the excuse ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt know what needed to be done, You didn‚Äôt say you needed help with anything‚Äù. I tell him to just look around, if something looks dirty, clean it - I keep reminding him I‚Äôm not his mom and I should have to create ‚Äúchore lists‚Äù for him. It‚Äôs not difficult.

Anyway after a long week of work, I was fried and begged him to take over most of the cleaning this weekend. He understood and agreed. The next day I come home to find he has ordered a cleaning service to clean the house, while he hung out for the day. I was upset with him and accused him of being lazy. His reasoning was that he could see how stressed I was, and wanted to give us an opportunity to relax together this weekend. I was still pissed and did not talk to him for the rest of the day. We had a few fights over it, and he genuinely can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm getting so mad at him ‚Äúbuying a gift‚Äù for the both of us. 

AITA for getting upset? I feel like he was trying to skirt a responsibility that I usually do myself almost every day. Is it too much to ask for him to take over the chores that day without having to pay someone to do it for him?

UPDATE: since hiring a cleaning service on a regular basis seems to be the go-to solution for many people, I should add that we cannot afford it. The one time expense did not break the bank, but we definitely have to adjust our budget this month to account for it. And it is 100% not something we can afford going forward. 

Update 2: since it has been asked, the cleaning was $500.

Update 3: thank you all for your inputs! I really appreciate both the validation on how I was feeling and also opinions offering a different perspective from my own. This has been extremely helpful for me to read through all the comments!

A couple of you suggested the web comic ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve asked‚Äù and I showed it to my husband. He was very receptive and understanding and is starting to better see my view in the situation. I also took into account some other things a few of you said, like his brain working differently and maybe not seeing the mess as much as I do and getting overwhelmed. I asked him about this and he said sometimes he does have trouble seeing why I get so stressed over a ‚Äúlittle dirt‚Äù and those things don‚Äôt bother or stand out to him as much. 

But he did admit to not really taking on his share fair of responsibilities, and going forward, we‚Äôre going to have weekly ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù where we prioritize the chores/repairs the house needs and each of us will take responsibility for separate things. I told him that if he has a defined list of things to do, then I will not be giving him reminders or cues to get them done - as the ‚Äúmothering‚Äù aspect of dictating chores constantly is annoying and stressful. He agreed to do them by end of week, and he can do them on his own time. 

We also are taking about doing more research into cheaper cleaning services in the area, and maybe, (if we can swing it) look into getting something done every two months or so. After reading the comments on how expensive $500 was for our small house, we both recognize we got ripped off.

So we are good! And I really appreciate all the input again. I‚Äôm thankful the communication between my husband and I is good enough where we can continue to have these conversations and come up with solutions together.",1646410088.0

I'm honestly just so tired of sharing everything. I have more than enough reasons. We are both late 20s. 

So heres the thing.. I have purchased one vehicle and leashed one other vehicle in the 5 years we have been together. Both times he wanted his name on the vehicle too and I had no problems with it at first, really. Made no difference to me. But I definitely have built up some resentment about it lately, admittedly. My leased vehicle.. he totaled it. I had the car for a year. He wasnt at fault for the accident but he still totaled it. I ended up owing $2k on the loan after they did the pay out. Because we didnt have $2k to pay up front, I couldnt take out another lease agreement until it was paid off. At that point he was unemployed because of the car accident (broken leg and collarbone) so it was completely up to me because the pay out HARDLY covered his medical bills. 

I ended up getting a beater car because it was all I could afford and we put his name on that one too a d for some reason.. it just pisses me off when he says ""our vehicle"". I dont know why but I'm assuming it's because I truly dont have a single thing in the house that is ""mine"", you know? And sometimes it feels like he rides off my achievements, even though I subconsciously know that's not the case. He is very much a ""what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine""  type of guy. But.. well.. guess who's car is totaled again? Some guy side swiped him 3 weeks ago and he smashed in to a pole. The other person's insurance company only gave us $1200 for the total loss. 

Well I found a vehicle and despite the fact that both of us are working.. I dont want his name on my car this time around. I know it truly doesnt make much of a difference but I just want it to be mine and mine only. I also dont even want him like.. driving my car. Despite the fact that he technically wasnt at fault for either accident. I'm just really tired of sharing my things and then having my shit totaled for no fault of my own. So I told him his name wasnt going on it and now he is pissed, saying I'm treating him like he has done me wrong. AITA?",1646511950.0

I(30f) had my son(11m) after a ons. I was only 19 when I had him and the guy didn't stick around. Because of this, I relied heavily on my family(mom, dad,  and grandma) for the first 6 years of son's life. This is between living with them, financial help when I wasn't making enough. And babysitting. I now own my home with my husband of 3 years right next door to my family and I financially help them to pay them back for the help they gave me.

My cousin, Joe, (26m) and his wife now have 5 kids. Joe moved 3 states away when he was 18 and just recently moved his family back to live with his father. Before they moved back, they were mostly homeless, going between public housing and motels. After their 1st child, they cut off our family after no 9ne could keep sending them money. They were convinced that we were all rich and were punishing Joe for moving. We were not, I was working a minimum wage job while in college while caring for my child, grandma is on ss, his dad was on disability, my mom works as a can and my dad is 9n disability. We weren't punishing, we were all just barely getting by.

Here recently after Joe moved back, he started throwing a fit that no one wanted to constantly watch his kids so they could get a break(every other day). He got Angier and angrier when he would see my son with my parents and grandma constantly. I tried to explain that it's because we live next door and my son is older and more independent(true but also his kids are out of control and no one can handle them). He finally lost it on my parents and grandma that they were showing favoritism with the grandkids. I finally snapped back that my son is the favorite for q reason.. I told him that no one had any responsibility when it came to his kids and if he wanted them to have a close relationship with everyone, he needed to make an effort and not cut everyone off when he was throwing a tantrum.

Our family is now torn on who was right or wrong. Grandma says I should have never said my son was the favorite and it wasn't my place to speak up. I feel like I'm in the wrong because I understand where my grandma is coming from.

t789xk,WIBTA If I inherited my parent's house when they pass away even though my sister would probably need it more than me?,,14,0.8,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t789xk/wibta_if_i_inherited_my_parents_house_when_they/,69,"Some context: my (32M) parents are immigrants turned US citizens. They emigrated to the US in 2000 when I was 12 and my sister (22F) was 2 months old. I'll save you the whole story but its basically the generic ""came from nothing"" success story. My father used to be a janitor and my mother a house maid. Now my father is upper management in a tech company and my mother an engineer. Together they make around 500k/yr. 

Because of this rapid success, my childhood was quite different from my sister's. I grew up having bread and butter for dinner, having to buy my own car in high school (+ insurance, gas, maintenance), and luxuries like a gaming console I had to save up my allowance for months on end to buy. My sister on the other hand, has almost absolutely everything handed to her. She got my father's old car once she went to college. He pays for the gas/insurance/maintenance. She wants expensive things for her birthday? No problem!

Don't get me wrong though, I love my sister. She's incredibly bright and talented, a straight A university student and an extremely talented artist. She also has a budding professional athletic career. The one thing is, she can't hold a job. Her excuse is that she doesn‚Äôt have time for one because of her university studies. Because of this, she's incredibly dependent on my parents financially. They pay for her rent (though she has chipped in here and there), her insurance, gas, pretty much everything. I'm pretty sure my parents even gave her a credit card attached to their account that she can use on whatever. To say I'm a little envious is an understatement.

Now finally to the issue: My parents recently came to me about their will. They said that I get to choose whether or not to receive their house or leave it for my sister. Thing is, I myself am very well off financially and I'm already a homeowner (though my parents' house is significantly bigger and nicer). I know that once my parents pass away my sister will no longer have the financial support she needs and will likely end up homeless since she will no longer be able to afford her apartment. I don't want this to happen to her, but at the same time I feel like I finally have an opportunity to get something nice from mom and dad for a change. I'm conflicted.

TL;DR My sister is financially dependent on my parents and I fear taking my parents house after they pass will leave her homeless, but at the same time I feel like I deserve it.

EDIT:
The house is not the only thing on the will, but its definitely the largest asset. My sister and I will get little in terms of monetary inheritance, mostly due to my parent's excessive spending. Sorry for not making this clear in the post

EDIT 2: What I meant to say about my sister not being able to hold a job is that she's tried doing part time but she quit. Now she doesn't even look for internships or do anything for career advancement. I got my job through connections from an internship, and I'm afraid her ""I'll get to it later when I have time"" attitude is setting her up for failure. I realize that a job during university is hard, but I want her to at least start making connections so she can step right into a career when she graduates.",1646482597.0
