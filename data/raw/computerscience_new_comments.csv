splm77,hwgc0ng,t3_splm77,"Hi !

interesting dataset...

There is a lot a way for you too innovate in classification. Objective of a thesis is often to build an original structure (different in one way with classical ones)  then compare. You not need to find a better way to do, just find a different way and benchmark/review it.

You Q is, in my mind, more a brainstorm question with your peers (post-grad student and maybe prof.) than a Q to publish as is. The feedback loop of chained ideas is a better way here to progress to a clever subject. The better depend also if you are an data analyst, a CS/maths, a maths/CS, a statistician or an num analysist (is this word exist... s'cuse my french otherwise \^\^)...

Warning too, i've not read article on this subject from some time, it's just an ""as is"" idea. Maybe a stupidity or rejected approach... Just to participate me best the 1st pass of brainstorm. A few years ago, I was offered to make a thesis on similar theme, I decline (too much university for me) but think about it. Then, again, it's far past and maybe stupid...

Nevertheless, if you think historical DL nets you could see last stage is full connected neural net. You should know firsts (conv and als. aka the CNN) stages are for extraction of abstract elements and that the effective classification is this last feedforward net.

Efficiency of this feedforward net can be interpretated with universal approx theorem or in them of probabilistic inference. In my memory (should not be far the reality) universal approx theorm is implemented in perceptron and cousins as  mean square algos (with variate optims). So finding the min/max of the error function. This could de made with matrix inverse with high calculus cost and some risk of instability in some conditions... This big block of calculus is a problem for learning with low energy/time.

Could we replace all or part (MSE part) of the FC ANN by somthing more convenient ? Remenber reading this article for MLP : 

[Performance\_Functions\_Alternatives\_of\_Mse\_for\_Neural\_Networks\_Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259952584_Performance_Functions_Alternatives_of_Mse_for_Neural_Networks_Learning)

But me, if I not dislike their robust estimators, I love quick and fun metaheuristics ! 

So my proposition and question all in one :

Could you use instead of, in complement of a smaller full connected last stage, of some really small perceptron/multilayer perceptron last stage, one, some, a combination of metaheuristcs to approxiamte the class more quickly ? How modeling transition from output of CNN to input of metaheuristics ? Can we estimate mean/max error increasing over time gain ? Gain in parallelization capability (not a lot of MSE parallelizes algo if I remember) ? comparing different methods ? Could you interrelate a compression layer (depending the model chosen as inputs for metaheuristics) between the CNN and classificator ?

It's more, in my mind a ""modelisation"" (Fully Connected ANN and metaheuristics algo have a different structure, how transform data from one to other, reversibility ?, constraint to add ? (spacial structure mainly) : how do that ? entoencoding ? in main components statistical dim reduction ? using some small classificators, one par abstract component ? HELL ! ***can we even do that ? could we do it ? wo are you ? what do you do in my room ?***) and ""metrics/benchmarking"" about subject. But the student and his/her tutor may easily vary the angle.   Plus :

(1) the size of set of methods studied is easily scalable (more heuristics, more metrics if moretime (it will not happen \^\^))

(2) the subject is easily cuttable in n\*(building models of data & constraints) + m\*(study of an algo + benchmarking) ...

two criterion to take care when you choose a time constraint project subject.

... too long, probably no as clear as I expect and maybe out of feasibility but in brainstorm even strange ideas could be refined in good ones with iterations ! (With a little bit of change maybe you could built the first classification ""with black matter img""/""without bm img"" network (nobody could say its wrong...)...) But not all...

I hope you will find your dream one at the end !",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1644546836.0

1. prim's algo is greedy, which means it always take the best candidate out of a pool of options. this is relevant for the cut property as we always take the edge with smallest cost out of those edges that connect a node that was already selected and a node still to select
2. a tree has the same nodes as the starting graph G={V,E}, just less edges

the thing about cuts is that they let you select node after node without worrying about  cycles - starting from whatever node J, your cut only contains J; J must be part of the MST, so we select the edge with minimum cost (this part should be clear). now the cut expansion: we add the node that was the other endpoint to the selected edge and we call it K: K is now part of our cut. this means that after this step we have a subtree made by the cut {J,K}.

next step: add another node with the above reasoning (we call it L). here is the trick: we now have a subtree T={J,K,L}, and since the cut only lets us select edges such that one endpoint is in T and the other is in V\\T, we will always avoid cycles as no further connection among nodes can be selected, these connections being edges fully inside the cut

soq68k,hwbayfs,t3_soq68k,"During the era when x86 rose to dominance, there were basically two strategies to compete. Intel sought to innovate in physics: fabrication at smaller nanoscales, and chips running at higher clock speeds. Their competitors - particularly Sun Microsystems - sought to innovate in logical efficiency: RISC architecture, instruction pipelines, branch prediction, etc.

Fabrication physics turned out to be the better bet. If you can make the smallest transistors, you can have your cake and eat it too: all the clever tricks enabled by RISC, *and* high clock speeds, *and* complex instructions (which, at the time, were still relevant for hand-assembled high performance applications, like games). This is how Intel won, and we ended up with the hybrid RISC/CISC design of modern x86.",22,0,0,0,22,False,False,False,1644460171.0

soq68k,hwcorvm,t3_soq68k,"To answer your question ARM based processors and SoCs already vastly outnumber Intel and AMD x86/x86-64 devices due to their ubiquity in mobile devices and embedded systems. The only exceptions to this are PCs and servers. In fact, both AMD and Intel have made and still make their own ARM based devices.

As for if or when x86-64 will be beaten in the PC and server markets nobody knows but Intel is spending huge amounts of money on the RISC-V architecture right now. I'm talking billions of dollars worth of investment so they might eventually push for RISC-V in the PC market which they currently dominate. 

Contrary to all the idiots who call it ""the Intel architecture"", x86-64 is designed and patented by AMD though based on Intel's 32-bit IA-32 (x86) architecture. The tables have turned and now Intel uses AMD64 i.e. x86-64 under a cross-licensing agreement with that company. Much more recently Intel is trying to become a contract foundry however they cannot offer their x86-64 hardware IP to their foundry customers because they don't directly own the patents for the instruction set architecture itself. If they focus on RISC-V which is owned by a non-profit organization that licenses it to everyone at no cost then they can develop and license hardware IP that implements that family of architectures to their foundry clients and life is good. 

That and the x86 family of instruction set architectures is frankly just terrible. Everything is inconsistent even the register naming for the exact same type of integer registers. Anyone who has had to write assembly for it knows that compared to that mess, ARM and RISC-V look downright beautiful and much more modern. If you think of an ISA as a very low level programming language implemented directly in hardware than an analogy to high level languages would be that x86-64 is like C++, old and with tons of crap tacked on in a hopeless attempt to keep it up to date with modern needs while RISC-V is like Rust, new and clean while implementing all the best ideas from years of research and concepts borrowed from all of its older competitors but in a clean, efficient, and coherent manner.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1644490134.0
soq68k,hwasd1j,t3_soq68k,"The 8080 was the precursor to the 8086 (the start of the 86 in x86), and it had a competitor that was the z80 - it was instruction set compatible with the 8080 but added more registers and instructions. It was quite successful and perhaps dominant in the 8-bit microprocessor space.

The 8086 / 8088 had competition with the Motorola 68000 line of processors. These were 16-bit processors that became 32-bit processors with the 80386 and 68020. Apple Macs run with the 68000, as did the Amiga and Atari ST. But the IBM PC was the dominant machine and software was not portable across these machines, so the software base essentially entrenched the x86 line with DOS/Windows as the operating system.

Apple, IBM and Motorola tried to compete again with the PowerPC processor, and Macs moved to that from the 68000. No-one else really did though and it fizzled.

Apple moved their Mac to the x86 which seemed like the end of the processor wars, but now ARM is rising from the embedded space and with Apple having a pretty fancy processor in their M1 line based on the ARM architecture, it may give Intel a run for their money.

Processing power per watt seems to be a primary measure that is driving competition as well as raw processing power. ARM has always done well with efficiency and with Apples (proprietary) efforts seems to have overtaken Intel on the laptop/desktop.

There is still the cloud computing market where both measures are important - efficiency is important when you are running so many machines with such a huge global workload. But absolute power is also important for those workloads that do not scale horizontally.

But if you can easily recompile your software for a different processor (which languages like Go make rather trivial in most cases), the processor becomes far less relevant.

Legacy is huge in computing, so it is not likely that x86 is going anywhere, but what usually happens is that the market outgrows the legacy and a new larger market runs with the new tech - mainframes used to be the bulk of computing - they still exist, but were supplanted by different modes of computation.

For the other one, my stock answer is:

----

Can you answer the questions

* What *is* a computer?
* How do we build an electronic one?
* What *is* an operating system, and how are they made?

They look simple, but it's surprisingly difficult to give something more than a very trivial answer. From your post it sounds like that's what you're asking, basically. You want to know what the physical machine is doing, how it's controlled, and how the compiled executables that you write is somehow executed on it via an operating system.



If you want to learn about computer architecture, computer engineering, or digital logic, then:

1. Read [**Code** by **Charles Petzold**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319).
2. Watch [Sebastian Lague's How Computers Work playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq)
2. Watch [Crash Course: CS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) (from 1 - 10) 
3. Watch Ben Eater's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypETld5oX1ZMI-LYoA2LWi8D) about transistors or [building a cpu from discrete TTL chips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). (Infact just watch every one of Ben's videos on his channel, from oldest to newest. You'll learn a lot about computers and networking at the physical level)
3. If you have the time and energy, do https://www.nand2tetris.org/

There's a lot of overlap in those resources, but they get progressively more technical.

For operating systems, do what [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems) says and read any of these:

1. Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Modern Operating Systems
2. Silberschatz et al - Operating System Concepts
3. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces  (it's free!)

These will let you understand *what* a computer is and how a CPU, GPU, RAM, etc works. It will also give you the foundational knowledge required to understand how a OS/Kernel works, how software works etc. Arguably it will also give you the tools to design all of how hardware and software components, though actually implementing this stuff will be a bit more involved, though easily achievable if you've got the time. nand2tetris, for example, is specifically about that design journey. (And if you follow Ben Eater's stuff and have $400 to spare, then you too can join the club of ""I built a flimsy 1970's blinkenlight computer on plastic prototyping board""). For os you can also hit up /r/osdev and the osdev wiki

Learning this stuff will make you much better programmer than if you didn't learn it, and you'll be better at debugging and solving problems you have whilst writing software, but fundamentally it'll also make programming much more satisfying as you'll understand every single part of the stack from electron to e.g. python.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1644426035.0

sndcd7,hw1yona,t3_sndcd7,"In short: yes. But probably not in the way you really mean.

Computers don't have any sort of agency. If you run a program that causes hardware damage or malfunction, it will cause that damage or malfunction. A virus is a program that you didn't intend to run, but it's still the computer running a program, and there's no sort of ""ego"" inside it making a judgement about what it should or shouldn't run (although, of course, nearly every sort of computer that most people are familiar with has some sort of ""permissions"" or other mechanism in the operating system, which is just yet another program governing how and when to execute other programs).

There are very few *truly* random things that happen to a computer - of course, nature can do strange things, especially in space, where the atmosphere and the earth's magnetic field don't protect computers from being bombarded by radiation that can affect their usual electrical function. Even the things that ""appear"" random are most frequently either based on measuring something natural (say, pointing a camera at a wall of lava lamps) or something not random at all, but complex enough to seem random, and statistically close enough for the purpose they serve. There are also *all sorts* of unintended things where a programmer meant for something different to happen than what their program actually causes to happen - this is never a matter of the computer exerting its will, but more about unintended consequences or gaps in the programmer's reasoning.

Finally, let's talk about what a computer can actually do to destroy itself: most normal operations accessible by software won't do hardware damage to a computer, but there are many very significant exceptions: software put in charge of moving parts, for example, can absolutely damage those moving parts (for example: the [Stuxnet virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) caused Iranian nuclear equipment to spin themselves apart, quite literally). Many older gaming systems had far more close a connection to basic electrical hardware than newer, and it wasn't out of the question that a bad Game Boy game could damage the console - part of the certification process was examining the way developers addressed the memory mapped to display and sound hardware, for instance.

On a desktop or laptop computer, there's a huge amount of variety in the exact hardware, but numerous systems have limitations or assumptions that can be violated if a programmer is clever enough. It's possible, given enough time and access, to write sectors of a hard drive until they fail. It's possible to run some systems very hot until bad things happen, or to exploit defects in programs that control important things not intended to be exposed to external control by programs (for example: allowing users to execute program code on a person's computer by sending messages to the Minecraft server they're playing on - possible because of defects in popular logging functions in Java).

Some hardware can be controlled in such a way to render the machine unusable. They often call such a situation ""bricking"" a device - damaging it in some way beyond restoration, so it's as inert or useful as a brick. Destroying the firmware - very low-level programs and data used to control the most basic operation of a device - is one way to do such a thing, and usually, firmware has at least one way to be updated or overwritten.

So: if you'd intended to ask if a computer can become suicidal, the answer is definitely no - but software written to intentionally or unintentionally damage a machine can absolutely cause anything from inconvenience to irrecoverable physical damage, and there are many motives for a *person* to create it (incompetence, the challenge of getting around the ""fences,"" state-sponsored terror, national security, police work, you name it), but computers have no motives of their own any more than a dropped object has a motive for falling to the ground.

For pure software things like wiping the OS a new OS can be installed (but the data may be lost forever). If you pummel the same sector of a hard drive until it becomes unreadable you can swap for a new hard drive. Sometimes though, the hard drive is soldered to the motherboard so you need special equipment and expertise to replace it. Likewise with a corrupt firmware you can flash a new firmware externally. So I would see all the above as bot ""dead"" (in your analogy) but hurt enough that you need to go to the ICU.

sndcd7,hwfethw,t1_hw1x79l,"Generally speaking, any software can delete data or information that it has access to, often including itself.

A computer system consists of *hardware* and *software*. There are some grey areas, but generally speaking, the hardware is the physical electrical circuitry or machinery that can store information and perform computational operations on it. In a desktop or laptop computer, this would include the processor (a.k.a. CPU for Central Processing Unit), the working memory used for keeping information that's needed by currently running programs (commonly referred to as RAM), and the permanent storage used for keeping information and programming in the longer term.

A practical computer you're familiar with would also include a lot of supporting hardware that supplies power, coordinates communication between the CPU and the memory, and for all kinds of auxiliary tasks. Those are not fundamentally as crucial for computation, although they're practically important for the tasks we use our laptop or desktop computers for.

Individual operations that the circuitry, or the hardware, is capable of performing would include things like numerical addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and a number of other arithmetic or logical operations. A computer processor's *instruction set* would also include operations for loading a particular number or piece of data from the computer's memory so that those arithmetic operations can be done on it, and for storing the result of a computation back into the memory.

Present-day computers have dedicated hardware for more complex individual operations as well, for reasons of performance and efficiency, but it's theoretically possible to build a fully programmable computer with fairly basic individual operations.

The programming, or *what* the information processing procedure that should be performed on some particular information is, is defined by the software, or by the programming. (The programming, or the rules of processing the information, could also be directly done as hard-wired circuitry, but as the name implies, software is more flexible; software programming can be changed afterwards without changing the physical circuits. That flexibility is why software exists separately from the hardware in the first place.)

Any programming that's more complex than the basic operations is built from a series of such fairly basic operations. Even in an application that downloads video data from YouTube and renders it on your display has just got an awful lot of those basic additions, multiplications, other arithmetic or logical operation, and memory loads and stores.

All of the data **and software programming** on a computer resides on its storage media. (That's may actually not be strictly true in real computers, as there can be some programming that's been built more tightly into the hardware itself and is not as easily erased or overwritten, but I'm making some shortcuts here for simplicity.) For example, all of your documents and files, but also all of your applications, reside on the storage device of your computer. The storage device used for permanent or long-term storage is usually either a hard disk drive or some kind of a solid-state memory. The storage device isn't really fundamentally important here, though. What's important is that the programming resides in the same memory with the *data*, or the information that the programming is meant to process or manipulate.

Erasing data -- all the ones and zeroes -- on the storage device, or overwriting it with random data or with all zeroes (effectively a blank), isn't really a complicated operation, computationally speaking.

A very simple computer program that allows you to add two numbers together might consist of the following operations, approximately:

    read input number from user, store it in location A
    read input number from user, store it in location B
    add A to B, store result in location A
    output number stored in location A

A program could also, almost as as simply, consist of the following operations:

    get location of the start of one's own program code, store it in location A
    let m be A

    place a marker named ""loop"" here
    
        store value zero at location m
        increment m by one memory location, i.e. let m be m + 1

        if m is still within the program code, go to marker ""loop"";
        otherwise, stop the program.

That's not programming in any actual programming language, but it could easily be written in many of them.

That kind of a program would start from the beginning of the program's own program code (perhaps in the long-term storage), go through the programming instructions one by one, and erase each of them until reaching the end of the program code.

As far as the laptop on your desk goes, modern operating systems have security precautions that prevent applications, or programs that are not the operating system itself, from accessing, modifying or erasing programming or information that belongs to the operating system. An individual application is thus not practically able to remove the operating system, or other applications, or all of the programming on the computer if you don't give it permission to.

Fundamentally speaking, though, a program can alter information in the memory; the program's own code is in the memory; ergo, a program can be written to erase itself. If it weren't for the security precautions built into today's operating systems and hardware, there'd be nothing that would prevent *any* program on the computer from erasing all of the programming on the computer.

This may be a bit of an anticlimax for you, but on a fundamental (rather than everyday practical) level it's essentially trivial to write a computer program which, when the program is run, destroys itself, along with all other data and programming on the computer.

In practical computers, since *some* of the rather fundamental programming of the computer, such as [the program code that looks for an operating system or other programming in the first place when you start the computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting), typically resides in a dedicated storage outside of the ""normal"" memory of the computer accessible by normal programs, some of that programming is practically not as easily erased. It's still possible, though, and if you look at computers as less of a physical laptop or desktop and more as a philosophical thing, there are no such restrictions.

\- Every single output made by the algorithm is after it has generated exactly N uniformly random bits.

\- The distribution of its output is the same as it was before the modification. Tossing useless random bits before outputting doesn't change the distribution.

So now if we are told the outcome of the N random bits, we know exactly what the algorithm will output.

Absolutely not.  A [double is represented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) as 64 bits, so there are only 2^64 doubles in existence.  Are you telling me there are only 2^64 real numbers in [0,9000) ? Of course not!

No. Each input appears uniformly at random, so in the limit each input will appear, in expectation, an equal number of times.  The outputs however, are biased and in the limit the bias only gets worse, not better because the output bin is entirely determined by the input.

>  In the limit of generated numbers, you will indeed have equal numbers of balls in each of the 9000 bins. 

If you had 16 balls and tried to throw them into 5 bins, your bias might look like {4,3,3,3,3}.  Now you might say ""aha, next time maybe the 4 is biased towards another bin and get smeared out"".

I ended up choosing a college diploma in computer science and honestly very thankful for this decision.  Even had a buddy from high school who attended first year at a university for software engineering then decided to switch over to the comp sci at college after we chatted and compared what we were studying.

The comp sci program I went through was 6 semesters of intense study + 3 semesters of work placement, and had something like a 20% graduation rate as many people quickly found that programming wasn't for them (also it was a very intense program).  We studied everything from hardware, assembler language, algorithms (big O), data structures, design patterns, operating systems (ex. coding patches on linux kernel), compilers (dragon book as the textbook), real-time programming (for hardware controllers, etc - the electrical engineering crew also attended these classes), graphics programming (openGL but didn't get into directX), networking infrastructure and protocols (including some good stuff like using netcat to send emails or make HTTP requests), database design, SDLC and project planning (scoping, documentation, diagrams), and of course a hell of a lot of coding - mostly C, C++, and Java with a bit of BASH scripting included for good measure and good knowledge to have.  SVN was still pretty new at the time (and git was brand spankin new) so it was mentioned but not formally taught in class, though some of us did choose to use it on team projects.  Code style, structure, maintainability, extensibility, etc were all things we were expected to build good habits for and were graded on in some cases.  Many of our technical professors had solid real-world experience so they knew what practical knowledge we needed to learn.

In the city where my college is there are also two universities but employers (in both public and private sector) prefer hiring comp sci graduates from the college because they have the practical knowledge to start delivering results right away.  I graduated quite a while ago and over the years haven't had much trouble finding employment or putting my skills to good use.  I do feel that without a full degree there are some jobs I wouldn't qualify for (especially at bigger corps like FAANG, but it isn't really my interest to work in big corps anyway) or that I might hit a certain ceiling in promotions, but I'm currently doing alright as a lead/senior dev at a small startup.

The [TCP/IP Guide](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free) is hands down the best protocol resource on the the internet. It has the protocol history and usually a great explanation on how it is constructed and used. It is dated, but don't let that reduce its usefulness, given your post here is about 40 year old standards first proposed in the infancy of the internet.

Read about [IP Protocol](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_InternetProtocolIPIPv4IPngIPv6andIPRelatedProtocol.htm) here

[IP Classful Addressing](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPClassfulAddressingOverviewandAddressClasses.htm) is a great explanation of the classful schema.

As others have stated, ip address classes are dead. 
CIDR is the way. Note classful addresses DO NOT USE MASKS. Masks are a CIDR construct. 

Classful addressing uses the bits of the first octet to break the ranges

Subnets are not tied to classes anymore, that's how I would interpret the following sentences from the [CIDR Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing):

> The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to _replace_ the previous classful network addressing architecture on the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

and

> Whereas classful network design for IPv4 sized the network prefix as one or more 8-bit groups, resulting in the blocks of Class A, B, or C addresses, under CIDR address space is allocated to Internet service providers and end users on _any_ address-bit boundary.

Yes. Understand that it what I call ""subnet broadcast"". Typically routers will block all such broadcast packets from ""hopping"" to another subnet. (Assuming they aren't manually misconfigured to allow it.) Also understand that such packets can easily overwhelm a subnet, since **every** device on the subnet will receive it. IT departments will quickly hunt you down if they see any such packets without authorization.

&#x200B;

>Second, should I edit my table to start at x.x.x.1 instead of x.x.x.0 and end in x.x.x.254 versus x.x.x.255?

the .0 for a class C network ([255.255.255.0](https://255.255.255.0)) denotes the ""network address"". Think of it as a way to identify the entire subnet. Therefore the *assignable* address would always be between .1 and .254 inclusively. Now, by *convention*, we typically reserve .1 as the network's gateway/router address. However there's nothing technically preventing a gateway/router's address from being any assignable number.

Additionally, if you use the ""global broadcast"" ([255.255.255.255](https://255.255.255.255)) address, such packets could hop subnets depending on the TTL (time to live) number and the router configurations. Given a misconfigured gateway, they might even leak out to the internet. (Although most internet providers are smart enough to never let that happen.)

This isn't quite accurate. Floating point numbers are ultimately represented as integers. And some architectures have the notion of bit sets, a data type consisting of some number of bits, where each bit interpreted individually. Other architectures have data types like character strings, which are also ultimately represented as integers. And computer scientists have explored other means of representing numbers like residual number systems. These haven't found much success.

> Why don’t computers support more data types?

This question is similar to, ""Why don't computers support more instructions?"" The CISC v. RISC debate from the 1980s answered this question (and any other ones like it). Basically, because supporting data types that aren't applicable to many programs is ultimately wasteful. The cost of supporting them will degrade performance in cases where they aren't used. The argument that having support for x will improve performance is only true if x is frequently used. This is true regardless of what x is.

I can think of two examples: the CDC series of vector supercomputers that started off with the STAR-100 from the early 1970s, which ended with the ETA-10 in the late 1980s; and the DEC VAX architecture from 1977. These computers/architectures had support for polynomials. A separate polynomial data type isn't necessary; these examples just treated them as floats. I'm sure there are more CISCy architectures out there that also had similar support. 

Support for polynomial evaluation can really only be implemented in a general-purpose computer as complex microcode. The lesson learned from these historical examples is that microcoded implementations don't really improve performance at all. Today, if you really need to do stupendous amounts of polynomial evaluation, then you'd see if it could be done faster on a GPU, an FPGA, or an ASIC.",8,0,0,0,8,False,False,False,1644150703.0

slotas,hvtyxm8,t3_slotas,"Well, yes, you can build hardware that implements your encoding and would likely be able to do reasonably efficient manipulation. The reason why such encodings are not used in practice can be found when you try to answer the following questions:

* Why is this useful?
* Is this encoding more efficient, able to do operations on polynomials faster or with less power than just a list of ints representing the coefficients?
* Is designing, manufactoring and deploying the specialized hardware worth the potential benefits we discovered above?

To answer some of them, I feel like this is highly convoluted, just storing an int array is far easier to implement and likely just as efficient to multiply, evaluate etc.

There always are trade-offs when designing data type encodings. For example, when representing the coefficient inversely in a float, addition becomes harder. Taking the inverse and multiplying does not become easier at all. The result is just less efficient in summary -- you could call it an engineering failure.

There are some specialized hardware instructions that do non-standard bit manipulation, like multiply-without-carry. In most cases, tho, you have certain bit manipulation tricks to do that almost as efficient.

The catch is: the higher the abstraction, the farthest you are from the hardware and (as a general rule) the slower you program will run. That is because the only data types that the hardware can deal with directly are integers and floats. 

Why is that? Because general processors has to be generals, so you want to deal only with the basic blocks that can then be use to abstract all the other operations. 

As other users said, there are less general processors that use more sophisticated data types (for instance complex numbers) but then you can't use them to represent other abstract structures. As everything in CS, there's a trade off.

You can repeat this all the way down until you're looking for how often the last letter appears (which is easy again). Your result is the total number of word ends you found.

This is how this could look like in practice:

That said, these issues are not insurmountable, given that architectures like x86, the Power ISA, and RISC-V support misaligned accesses (optionally in the case of RISC-V). x86 always had support misaligned accesses; all Power ISA implementations suffer from a performance loss if misaligned accesses are used, AFAIK; and RISC-V's architects have noted that misaligned accesses complicate matters architecturally and for implementers (hence the reason why they're optional).

In this scheme, if your floats are not aligned, then you need some additional shifting operations before you can load them into your registers.

This makes the assumption that values can *only* be loaded from non-overlapping segments from the cache line.

With natural-alignment, the CPU designers have more opportunities to reduce physical hardware wires. With strict word-alignment, the machine must retain all address wires for any circuit that handles addressing. But with natural-alignment, the bigger the operand-size, the fewer address wires you need to keep around. Suppose you have a modern CPU with 40 bits of physical addressing (1TB addressable RAM). If you're operating on a 512-bit operand, you can drop the lower 9 bits of address and you only have to use 31 wires for addressing, instead of all 40. That's ~23% savings and when you replicate that across many circuits in a CPU, you're talking about big benefits in terms of cost, die-space, frequency, power, latency and so on.

Note that x86 kind of has both, since many instructions require the CPU to be able to perform byte-addressing. Thus, the byte is the implicit ""word"" of x86.

skltie,hvmih9o,t1_hvmcvjm,"1) a convex combination of x and y is λx+(1-λ)y for λ in [0,1], so λ and (1-λ) are both fractions. Unless we get lucky the sum of fractions is also a fraction. Eg (1/3)0+(2/3)1 doesn’t equal a whole number. In general if you take two integral points the line segment connecting them will only have a finite number of integer points and uncountably many fractional points. 

2) because integrality constraints aren’t convex, the rest are linear constraints. 

3) yeah a tour is just an ordering of the cities of which there are n!

4) in practice submodular functions are like “convex” set functions. It’s a set function that satisfies diminishing returns. The more things you have already, the less new items help. Eg money, a dollar is worth more to someone poor than to a billionaire. Consumption of most single goods is submodular (getting one apple is good unless you already have lots), something like shoes is not because one shoe likely sucks, but a pair is nice. Uranium is likely not submodular because having a little sucks, but if you get enough you can make a nuclear reactor or a bomb. 

4.5) adding a submodular function makes the problem more general and thus harder, they are just nice functions that usually doesn’t make it “too much” harder. Whereas by comparison adding “my favourite tour” as the objective makes it as hard as possible (because it can’t be harder than brute force). 

For any set function we can just exhaustively check all 2^n subsets, the more structure the function has we can leverage the better we can do. It’s worth noting that if your set function is fully arbitrary then just representing it takes at least 2^n space. Usually we assume we have some oracle that will magically tell us the value of a set, and then measure the complexity of our algorithm in the number of oracle queries. 

*Roughly* speaking any NP-Hard optimization problem can’t be a linear objective over a convex set, otherwise we can just solve it directly (some issues on size of representation, numerical accuracy, and approximation and such) if we can solve the separation problem for it efficiently though then we can solve the original problem efficiently (up to numerical accuracy).",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1644014789.0

Programming requires a lot of creativity and you are often confronted with unique problems and unique requirements. Solutions have to be precise and there is very little room for error. There are a ton of software products programmers work with. Machine learning has no way to think or handle unique situations so they won't work.

Its possible they could do some basic standard apps like shopping apps. They are currently being used for syntax highlighting and coding suggestions for software developers because these jobs are somewhat predictable. I think they will be used to generate unit tests.

Machine learning does what it was designed to, and majority will become users that create value not builders that create opportunity for value.

Website programming is required for information publishing (static or streaming), sales, data collection, and social. There are many easy ways to get your website out there with templates for all of these technologies. Past what templates offer you might need a developer, but it's mostly content creators that are needed once a template becomes good enough. I would argue it's not the development that is the bottle neck it is the design.  Even social media template sites exist. You will still need smart folks developing templates, but less as value creators settle for packaged products, rather than seeking out something new from value enablers.

Tool programming. I don't see this going away any time soon. Finance and logistics tools are just not capable of being perfect and handling every situation, as are content creation tools.

They concurrently run many processes and thus you can't get an accurate true run time because of the uncertainty of the computer's run-time conditions.

To combat these things, theoretical computer scientists estimate the run time of algorithms via asymptotic run time. This is the familiar Big-O notation (although there are others such as little-o, Big-Omega, etc.). But most of the time, people just want an estimate of how the algorithm's run-time grows **with respect to the algorithm's input.** In the case of the Traveling Salesman problem, the input is the number of cities or towns, and it's asymptotic running time is O(N!), which people usually just equate to ""exponential"" time.

Now, you asked for examples so I’ll give you a personal one. I work as a data scientist. Our enterprise cloud data platform has to deliver data products (visualizations, reports, etc.) to consumers. One technical way that we measure user experience on the platform is by evaluating the performance of our Power BI capacity instance. If the utilization/load is too high then our end users will encounter delays and the overall user experience will decline/suffer. Monitoring these hardware resources and identifying which resources are being stressed helps us decide how to optimize the delivery of data products to the platform and it helps us protect against potential slowdowns.

In general, algebraic structures like group, semiring, lattice; spaces (which in my mind are also algebraic structures) like vector space, topological space, measurable space, and Banach space; and to be more abstract, category theory, are all incredibly useful in my area.

To give you some example, programs naturally have a semiring structure, where the addition is given by non-deterministic choice, and multiplication given by composition. If you add an iteration operation on it, you will get [Kleene Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_algebra): an equational theory that is vastly useful not just in program semantics and verification ( https://mamouras.web.rice.edu/other/phd-thesis-2015.pdf ), but also in abstract reduction system ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220118377_Abstract_abstract_reduction ).

There are extensions to it to verify different kind of systems, some of them can be found in https://mamouras.web.rice.edu/other/phd-thesis-2015.pdf ; and
 
- there are ways to reason about concurrency: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04081-8_27 ; 
- network applications: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/NetKAT-APLAS.pdf ; 
- correctness of programs: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/typedHoare.pdf ; 
- incorrectness of program: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498690 ; http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-88701-8_20.pdf

and many more.

And there are also related systems that are based on lattices, the most notable one is [Quantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantale), or sometimes called Kleene Algebra à la Conway. It is a stricter notion of Kleene Algebra. And many lattice based systems are mentioned in [here](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35095875.pdf)

For spaces, they are necessary to reason about probabilistic programs. For example, the famous [Kozen 81](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/ProbSem.pdf) asserts that all probabilistic programs needs to live in a Banach space for a reasonable semantics. Later, Fredrik and Dexter follows this up with [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/ProbSemPOPL.pdf), which uses ordered Banach spaces to formulate the higher order semantics of probabilistic programs. Topological space, given its simplicity, are still surprisingly essential in program reasoning, [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~praveenk/papers/cantor-scott.pdf) demonstrates that choosing the right topological space for the measurable space have important practical impact on program reasoning and semantics.

Add to that important topics in the CS/software industry like concurrency, distributed computing, AI.

There’s a difference between learning SQL (which many CE/EE do) and knowing when and why you should prefer a bitmap index instead of a B-tree.

There’s a difference between learning to use Spark/Hadoop and knowing why the task/job won’t gain any speed up because of the specific class of problem you are trying to parallelize.

I’ve worked with EE and CE people with masters degree and they struggled to wrap their heads around certain concepts that are (should be) trivial to CS people. Also, because their code/design decisions didn’t take those core concepts into account and often times that meant trouble to the business.

Unlike your comment, I’m not saying one profession is better than the other. The difference is that you rarely see CS people dabbling into CE/EE roles while the opposite is quite common. That’s because the job market is hot for CS roles not the other way around.

The reason is that count sort isn’t really a sort at all, it’s a cheat that lets you recreate the original sequence in order without doing a single comparison, by indexing the values in a bit vector.

As you know, this comes at a memory cost equivalent to the largest number in the sequence (or the difference between the largest and smallest). Any optimization of this would either need to project this range onto a smaller range losslessly or abuse some regular distribution property of the original sequence. Intuitively this makes it impossible to do for arbitrary input sequences. There could still be optimizations possible for special classes of inputs, but I don’t think you can do it for arbitrary inputs.

We simply exploit the fact that electrical circuitry behaves logically. And because logical constructions can compose and scale well, we've end up with modern computers capable of supporting vast logical models.

The big trick is that physically, electromagnetism and material physics allow us to create electrical circuits, which we can model logic on.

sgzipv,hv3s1nw,t3_sgzipv,"In my advanced digital system design class we made a full cpu out of logic gates. It took a whole semester but it was really enlightening. This is what I got out of it in the most concise way possible.

Using only 5 gates you can get a 1 bit full adder. Input two 1 bit numbers and it’ll give you a result and a carry. The carry output from one can go into the input of another to make the adder able to handle 2 bit numbers. You can cascade as far as you want but modern computers use 32 or 64 bit architectures. Doing the twos complement with some more gates allows you to subtract two numbers. So we call the adder and twos complement circuit the arithmetic logic unit. Most real ALUs are super complicated but the result is the same. A digital circuit that takes two inputs, an operation code (add/subtract/AND/OR/SHIFT/ETC), and outputs a result. This is the calculator part of our calculator with a to do list.

Using more gates, you can make an SR NOR latch circuit that can hold data. Cascading these latch circuits like with the adder gives you registers. Usually a CPU has 32 registers built in and these are made with latches since they have to hold numbers. Each register holds a 32 or 64 bit number depending on the architecture. The ALU can only take input from the CPU registers so numbers that need to be crunched have to be moved from system memory to a register first.

The way this is all done is by a 32 or 64 bit number that is called an instruction. Which bit means what is defied by the instruction set, and usually they specify an operation, destination, source, and operand. Your destination, source, and operand comes from registers. 

add $1 $2 $3 
//add the numbers in register 2 and 3, and put it in register 1 
OP[31:24], DEST[23:16], SRC[15:8], OPERAND[7:0]

ld $7 300
//put the value in memory address 300 into register 7

These aren’t exactly correct but the idea is there. 
Finally you have a clock and a program counter that goes through memory one line at a time and executes the instructions. These instructions can jump to other spots in memory so you can create conditional jump statements to get your if statements. Above assembly, it’s all languages and compilers.

sgzipv,hv3tpqv,t3_sgzipv,"Back in Uni when I had a course that used the concept of Turing Machines a lot at some point it made click

The simplest Turing Machine has 1 Belt with a row of 3 different characters on it, either 0, 1, or a Blank meaning nothing, the head can read one Character at a time and you have a table that dictates how the machine will behave. The machine has a state it starts in and for each state the behavior is defined depending on what it reads on the belt. So e.g in State Nr.1 if it reads a 1 it will change it to a 0 move the belt one character to the left and change to state 2.

This machine seems quite simple, but now imagine you have a different machine that has an alphabet of 0,1,2,Blank. Even though it has more letters in theory you can still convert any Programm it runs into a Programm that our simple machine can run by converting the characters on the belt into a unique combinations of 1 and 0s, so eg 1 becomes 01, 0 will be 00 and 2 will be 11, then you ad a step into the instructions for reading a sequence and then treating it accordingly.

Since this works with 1 extra letter it will work with N extra letters meaning our simple TM can simulate any Turing machine regardless of its alphabet with its basic alphabet.

Same goes for machines that have multiple heads or belts, you just need to add logic that uses sections of the belt that store positions of simulated heads or belts. So now since we know that our simple machine can work the same way as a complex machine, we don’t have to prove it for any machine and don’t have to worry about it, and can work with complex machines to solve more complex problems knowing that the simple machine can do it aswell

And with computers and logic gates and bits it’s analog. We have bits that are our binary alphabet, and we have logic gates that generate output depending on inputs. We know we can muse bits to simulate the decimal system, and we know we can combine our simple logic gates to things like adders that can do math. So while keeping this in mind no matter how complex it gets, it will all boil down to bits beeing combined with logic gates.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1643700472.0

Arrays are probably the biggest hiccup. Yes to truly simulate an array you’d have to allocate a whole new structure on each update.

In the past we had mathematicians and electrical engineering.

The programmer mathematician brought in the pot the math parts, then electrical engineer brought in the engineering methods and principles. Now, it really depends on the history of the school.

If the school created it's program as an offshoot of the math department it will be called computer science, and they will teach you programming from the point when you already have a blinking cursor. If the school however created it's program from electrical engineering (like mine) you will start with the hardware, and start gaining skill from there.

There is a big part which will be common like programming languages, networks, algorithm theory/data structures/math, cryptography, 3d graphics, etc. so if you are doing a regular programmer job, it does not matter which direction you went.

Having a strong mathematical foundation will help generally, but honestly, a lot of math will only apply to specific areas. If you want to work in graphics, game development, physics simulations, etc, then trigonometry is extremely important, as is linear algebra.

If you want to work in machine learning, or AI, then you need linear algebra, but also statistics, and probably some calculus, especially for deep learning.

If you want to focus on compilers, or programming languages and semantics, then logic and set theory is the most important.

If you want to be an expert in security or cryptography then you need to understand number theory, prime numbers, etc.

You'll have to know enough math to be able to understand the concepts in a particular sub-field that's employing that math.

**Example** : Lets say you're solving a recurrence relation by substitution (useful for finding time complexity of recursive algorithms).

You need to be able to recognize an arithmetic/geometric progression when you see one and know how to find sum of such progressions.

Stuff like that.

On a different note:

1. Being able to apply math and understanding how it works aren't two separate things. To do the former, you need the latter.
2. If your college demands you take a math course, you'll be taking it and understanding the content, one way or another.
3. There are topics in Discrete Maths (commonly taught in CS programmes) that do explore how certain bits of Math work at a fundamental level (eg. formal definition of what a Boolean Algebra is in terms of sets and lattices).

...

sdur26,hujqz3z,t1_huf5bhm,"I see this infatuation with CLRS being promoted everywhere and touted as the be-all-end-all book to (self-)study for the subject. I honestly believe that this does more harm than good. I tried to self-study under CLRS before I started college. It made me scared of algorithms. I went back to it a few times during my undergraduate years, but I still never found it to be all that pleasant of a read. 

I still have this book on my bookshelf. I do go through it from time to time, and by this point, I'm familiar enough with the subject area that I no longer find it as daunting as I did during undergrad. However, for a self-learner, I truly believe that the road to understanding how to understand this book is a decade-long endeavor. For this reason alone, I don't think it is a good recommendation to push onto people as a self-study text.

----------------

I feel like the reason for the hype of the book is because of existing hype. This book was great when it first came out because it was one of the first comprehensive self-contained textbooks that generalizes several modern algorithmic patterns. It made the runtime analyses less of a combinatorial mindfuck and relegated it as almost a secondary citizen in comparison to the intuition and the soundness proofs. It deserves a definitive place in the history of modern algorithmics. By comparison, it is fairly accessible and acted like a great cross-disciplinary introduction to the systematic study of algorithms. Pick any modern Algorithm Design text: Skiena, Kleinberg, Sedgwick, and go through its table of contents. Their sections are almost all laid out in the same order as CLRS.

This is why CLRS is impressive, it is so comprehensive that even after over a quarter of a century, new textbooks in the field still follow the same overall structure that it first pioneered in the early 90s.

However, it's not an easy read. I don't just mean that this is a dense technical brick. 

It lacks a certain coherence. Some of the problems emphasize intuition, others emphasize rigorous proofs of time complexity, and still others emphasize a non-intuitive leap of logic required to prove the correctness of these algorithms. How do you show the correctness of greedy algorithms? Beats me. Within specific chapters, the problems and examples presented seem to jump all over the place as well. Even within the same example, you trampoline around from intuitive constructions onto awkward case analyses of some (unintuitive) abstract representation of the problem. There really isn't a unifying thesis for each chapter (or even each problem it discusses). Of course, there aren't any algo-design texts out there that have solved this problem, but I've definitely gone through a few other textbooks that are significantly more coherent and understandable. (In fact, take any two of Skiena, Kleinberg, Sedgwick, Erickson, and Dasgupta and you'll have a more readable presentation of everything covered in CLRS).

----------------------

Look, I don't want to knock on CLRS for the sake of knocking on it, but I really don't think that this is the textbook to push onto people looking to study algorithms on their own. 

I took both of my undergrad and graduate courses in algorithms with Kleinberg (both the textbooks and the lecturer) and the one thing that I am most grateful for in my second attempt to understand this material is the clarity of the presentation. If it weren't for the fact that I had a fantastic lecturer, it would have taken me many more trials before I would have been able to grasp the topic. This despite my general view that Kleinberg's textbook is much more difficult to get through than CLRS.

Unfortunately, CLRS - on its own - does not stand out particularly well when it comes to clarity of presentation.

----------------------

First - texts focused on **designing algorithms**:

I can also talk about the (non-CLRS) textbooks that were popular when I was in undergrad: Ericksons, Skiena, Kleinberg, Sedgwick, (and Dasgupta).

My favorite of the batch is **Sedgwick's Algorithms**, it's the most accessible of the batch, and takes a very grounded approach to help build up your intuition for the subject. For many of us, rereading it after more rigorous training may feel like this is almost too introductory, but that's what makes it an especially great guide to learn from on your own. My favorite part are the runnable examples that help to (literally) visualize these algorithms you're studying.

**Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual** is definitely the funnest read of the batch. The presentation on the actual algorithms themselves is great, it's got a light-hearted expository style like K+T, with a good dose of visual intuition like Sedgwick. However, the best part of the text is the pacing. It's the only textbook so far where I didn't feel fatigued after reading more than one or two sections at a time. This is because Skiena sprinkles small doses of breathers throughout the text; every 10-20 pages of text (mod exercises), he would add some fun anecdotes (""war stories"") related to the material. These are surprisingly interesting and engaging for a textbook on algorithm design, and it definitely helps to pace the book in a way that few other textbooks have really thought to do. 

On the flip-side, unlike CLRS, K+T, or Erickson, the ""Manual"" isn't nearly as comprehensive in the types of material covered. In terms of the core theoretical algo-design foundations, we get through the basic DS, search, graph traversal, and some dynamic programming + approximation algorithms. However, instead of drilling deeper into these topics and, for e.g., complexity + tractability, the ""Manual"" pivots in the second half towards more practical applications. Many of these aren't really what you'd take away from from a typical algo-design undergrad course, but they're nevertheless very insightful, and significantly funner to read and learn about.

I haven't gone through all of **Erickson's textbook** yet, though this post motivated me to reread through a few chapters (Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and the two chapters on Max Flow/Min-Cut and applications of network flow). It's really very well written and well presented. In fact, I would even go as far as saying that it's genuinely fun to read through the chapters! I think it still suffers from some the same problem that many other algorithms books suffer, but it's definitely one of the most readable and accessible books on the market. The problems and algorithms presented are fairly standard (and covered without the depths of its denser counterparts). 

It feels a bit ""dated"" in the sense that it's still an exact (more-or-less) subset of all of the other Algorithms texts out there. For example, the use of Tower of Hanoi to illustrate recursion; Fibonacci #s, edit distance, and substring partitioning for dynamic programming. Gale Shapely's solution to stable matching, maximal interval scheduling, and huffman coding for greedy algorithms. These problems more or less encompass the entirety of these chapters as well. That said, that's not really a weakness. There hasn't been any significant breakthroughs that can/should be covered in an introductory monograph on Algorithm design. However, I'm impressed at the depth this book goes into for network-flow type reductions; until recently, this wasn't a topic indulged in much depth outside of Kleinberg & Tardos's Algorithm Design. (the bonus chapters also sound like fun extensions)

At the same time, I think my main gripe is that the text is still very heavily focused on presenting why a construction or design of a solution is the right one. This is obviously important, but it doesn't quite impart you with the intuition to design algorithms more generally. For example, why did we use this functional recurrence for edit distance and not look at other subproblems? How did we magically think about looking at the finish time for optimal interval scheduling? Why didn't we look at other types of network constructions for Baseball Elimination? That said, the section on stable matching does go down a false start first before giving the G&S construction. Of course, this is a shared problem that almost all textbooks share, nevertheless, I would have loved if there was a textbook that delves more into why seemingly intuitive algorithms don't work.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1643349193.0

sdur26,hujqzgu,t1_hujqz3z,"
--------------------

Next, onto textbooks about **analysis of algorithms**:

I love playing around with generating functions, and **Sedgwick's Analysis of Algorithms** spends a significant portion of the text on how to do these very novel and creative runtime analysis with tools like generating functions. He also published another text on Analytic Combinatorics, which is presented as a series of monographs of his own personal research interests. It's surprisingly accessible, very visual and intuitive, and leaves you with a feeling that you can count just about everything, or at least you can encode these problems as real-valued functionals and look for their singularities to understand how to count them. 

Next is **Kleinberg's Algorithm Design**, but again I'm biased because I was his student for algo. In contrast to CLRS, the best part of Algorithm Design was the exposition and the style. It's still very technical and theoretically inclined, but Kleinberg + Tardos put a lot of effort to make the text more readable. The other distinguishing feature of Algorithm Design is its inclusion of some more exotic algorithms that you usually don't find in a first course on algo design. 

Both K+T are algorithmic game theorists, and their influence in these and econometric algorithms shows through in their text. Most algo design texts mention reductions to max-flow/min-cut. Algorithm Design however spends significantly more of its tree-budget on network-flow type algorithms, both in the Network Flow chapter, as well as throughout in Greedy Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and in the discussion of complexity and tractability. His (in)famous course (CS 4820) on algorithm design also spends about a third of the semester on Network Flow back when I took the undergrad course.

Otherwise, I've never read through any significant chunk of Dasgupta. I hear good things about it, it's definitely the smallest text of the bunch.

Beyond these, the field has become significantly more popular since I've left school, so I don't doubt that other textbooks / resources have started to overtake these.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1643349199.0

Imagine you're baking a cake. More people can help, but there's a limit. One person can make the frosting while you're mixing the batter. That splits pretty easily and makes sense to do.

Theoretically you could have different people measure each ingredient out or one person per egg to crack but these steps are so quick you'd probably spend more time coordinating with each other than actually just doing the work yourself. Technically can be done in parallel but probably not worth it.

Then you need to actually bake the cake. I don't care how many people you have, you can't put the cake in until the batter is mixed. It doesn't matter how many ovens, the cake won't cook any faster. These steps fundamentally can't be parallelized.

You already know the monadic effect, however there are some effects that can be more effectively modeled as comonad. some reference on comonad as a model of computation: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108003435

There are notions of coeffect, and I am not sure if they are the same as comonadic effect. This seems like an interesting paper unifying coeffect and effect: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3022670.2951939 I am sure you can find some reference of coeffect in there. 

For research on monad, coeffect, and general categorical semantics, I would recommend to look into the work of [Tomas Petricek](http://tomasp.net/) (coeffect), Tarmo Uustalu (categorical semantics), and Marco Gaboardi (graded monad).

There is also what called algebraic effect (in the sense of algebraic data type, things defined without quantifier, or as an initial algebra). There is also a notion of [monad algebra](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/03/14/algebras-for-monads/), that to me seems to be slightly related to handler, but I am not sure.  

I recommend you to look into the work of [Matija Pretnar](https://matija.pretnar.info/) and [Andrej Bauer](http://www.andrej.com/) on this line of work.

There is also some less categorical approach where they focus on specific effects. One of the most popular one is reading and writing from memory, since it is one of the more theory rich effects.

This is reeeally not my area, so my ramble will get even less stable. 

I think this publication might be relevant here? https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2535838.2535869 I heard logical relation is very commonly used in this line of research to prove effectful program equivalence.

Also as you have mentioned that linear system can encode some safety properties of effect (for example no read before write etc.), but I have not found any relevant research on that, but you can find some [tutorials on ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/Documents.html#EFF2ATSPROGEX) that covers topics like this. ATS is a language with linear type, and it uses linear type a lot to guarantee some security properties of effects.",5,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,1643219446.0

The best thing ever are reading groups. Each discipline and subdiscipline should have a reading group, made up of 2 'layers' of people - 1 layer that is people who are actively in that space, or at least closely tangential, and then a bigger layer which is just anyone interested. For subdisciplines these are usually pretty small, for the larger disciplines these might include the whole school and beyond into other faculties and industry. Each <period>, depending on how many people, interest, publishing rates etc, as well as tied to each conference and major serial, you have people divvying up the papers that were released in that period to the internal layer to read. They then give a snap summary (1-3 sentences max) of those papers to a mailing list, with short recommendations, i.e. from 'this is garbage' to 'you must read this'. Then the 'you must read this' papers are read (or at least skimmed) by the outer layer who are interested, and everyone comes together to discuss them. If they're particularly good papers they get shunted up from the subdiscipline group to the main discipline for everyone to read.

Eh; the technology is interesting but generally there no actual good use case that needs a distributed ledger. We all use regular money just fine; it’s worked for thousands of years.

A lot of money and a lot of smart peoples time has been invested , and yet we’ve still only got crypto coins. So this amazing technology is basically useless.

Cryptocurrency looks very much like a fancy Ponzi scheme currently; the fact the supply of money is increasing at a fixed interval, means the higher demand for coins, the greater value each coin is, and this basically rewards those with existing high holdings. So they are incentivised to attract more people in, which is easier enough if the returns are there. But for those later to the party, you get less of the pot, and potentially don’t get the returns; pretty much a Ponzi scheme.

They should be able to give a set of topics to use as a foundation for your CS knowledge. If you have your course syllabus you may be able to research the books in advance, though particular classes may change their textbook from year to year so I wouldn’t get anything head of schedule as the textbook may change by the time you take the class.

sa6sdw,htsw6px,t3_sa6sdw,I think it’s better to do leisure learning rather than just getting into details. That will help more IMO when you actually take those classes just search topics you like and see what video lectures you can find.,1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1642891434.0
sa6sdw,htt5rgc,t3_sa6sdw,"If you have access to the materials of the courses you will be taking (syllabus, bibliography, etc), I'd suggest that you use them as guidelines. Nevetherless, here are my suggestions:

\- Discrete Math: this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz) follows some sections from the book *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications*, by Kenneth Rosen. You could follow the video lectures and read the corresponding section in the book. I'd suggest that you go up to video 30 (seems a lot, but they are not long); these cover Logic, basic Set Theory and proof techniques, which will give you a nice head start for when you begin your course.

\- Linear Algebra: I think the best resource you could ever want to study this subject is Strang's MIT course [18.06SC](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/). This version is organized specifically for self-study (it has exercises with solutions, lecture notes, etc). I'd suggest that you go through Unit I; this will be more than enough to give you a good start in the subject before your course.

\- Calculus: some may have better suggestions than mine, but I think Khan Academy's [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) course would let you well prepared for your first encounter with Calculus. Unlike the other subjects, Calculus requires that you are knowledgeable in algebra, trigonometry, etc. So if you have gaps in these prerequisites, I'd urge you to prioritize studying them instead of the other subjects I listed. LA and DM will be covered in your bachelors, but high school math certainly won't.

\- Programming: last, but not least, [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) from Harvard makes a nice introduction to programming for someone entering a CS major. This course does NOT focus on a particular programming language; instead, it teaches the basics of many programming languages (C, Python, Javascript) and covers basic algorithms and data structures.

Properly started learning ML properly 20 months ago (first commit on this repo is on 22nd of April 2020) and this is what I've been up to! Was lucky enough to get onto the GPT-3 beta and I've built a tool to automatically generate resumes based on some notes you enter. Has taken me forever to get it working but finally am at a first properly working version.

The idea is you'll only have to write your resume once (or not really at all), and then you can give it a job spec and it'll automatically tailor it for you.

The backend is a massive Django instance which is basically a JSON API (we use DRF to make this easier), which talks to a postgres DB and a redis cluster.

We also use celery for long running tasks (e.g. initially tailoring a resume or beat tasks like sending onboarding reminder emails which I'm setting up now).For the frontend, it's again pretty simple: NextJS with typescript (love typescript) and tailwind for css.

I also use headlessui, the component library from the tailwind team, which has been really helpful in places. The marketing site ([https://www.joinrhubarb.com](https://www.joinrhubarb.com)) is also a NextJS site, I think it's so good for these sorts of things.

The bert instances are all fastapi (not sure if I would use this again) with pytorch for inference. I deploy these on elastic beanstalk (which is also where everything else is deployed) and while it works great for everything else I worry that we're overpaying for some massive ec2 instances we don't need.

Last is the chrome extension which is also react/typescript but like... kinda hacked together with a custom webpack config which needs improvement. We will soon have firefox/safari extensions but it's quite annoying/painful to do and deploying to the stores means we need to go through approval processes which is annoying.

Once you understood the basics of GPT-3 how fast do you think it was to operationalize this? What did it cost to train the model? Was it easier or harder to do than you expected?

What made fastapi a bad tool to use in your deployment? I’ve generally heard positive things.

With these hyper-scale foundational models I’ve heard the volume of fine tuning data required to get improvement on a more specific corpus isn’t huge (I think it’s called one-shot learning?), was that your experience?

Is it learning in real-time or are the weights updated on a schedule?

Meaning you gain a lot with a 16-bit processor over an 8-bit processor because it can operate on two bytes at a time rather than one byte at a time--not because the byte happens to be 8 bits.

Now it turns out 8 bits worked well in earlier microprocessor designs because it was twice 4 bits--the Z-80 CPU, for example, actually had a 4-bit ALU, and would perform things like addition operations by carrying out the operation on the bottom 4 bits first, then again on the top 4 bits. (It's one reason why the Z-80 had the 'half-carry' flag in the flag registers, though the 'half-carry' flag could then be used for the [DAA (Decimal Adjust Accumulator)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8119577/z80-daa-instruction) instruction to perform [BCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal) addition and subtraction.)

But now that modern CPUs perform vectorized math using multi-byte words, the advantage of doing things like performing 8-bit arithmetic using a 4-bit ALU is lost. There is no reason why an ALU can't be 9 bits wide or 23 bits wide, except that we have gotten so used to 8-bit bytes we seem to think there's no other way.

Edit to add: As a side note, the reason why the PDP-10 was 36-bits wide 'byte' was that it was twice the PDP-9's 18-bit wide 'byte', and was able to vectorize operations by operating on two 'bytes' at a time.

s7yrsa,huj8us5,t1_huhwlet,"So they represent how the storage is chopped up. Your different variables, like assigning a color to a pixel is part of a system of standardizations. We decided on word size (8bit) now people wrote programs to manage that data storage schema but making the first few bits represent commands that the hardware would interpret as actions to take. So a system of programs (operating system) was eventually developed to manage the addition and removal of sequences of words that formed the actions on a cpu (programs). Because of this standardization we had to agree on how things would be read so we can make generalized logic that can do things on every system.

So eventually we get to the application layer (layer 7) which is a composite of general logical “applications” that live below it (layers 1-6). At this point the application is running on 6 layers of logical framework that all expect layer 1 (hardware) to be exactly those word sizes so that it can perform the millions of actions needed to generate the amount of changes in a system to output such complex functionalities. The color is a pixel isn’t just coloring the pixel, it’s the management of data storage in a way that can manage the color of the pixel in such a robust way that the hundreds of apps and services that are offered today can easily manage the changing of that pixels color in a very very very specific way. 

When you code you generally don’t say what a pixels color is you code what the background color is, or the text buttons color is, or you create an array that contains bits configured in what the program expects as rgb format or whatever makes sense and then you tell the cpu/gpu how each word is chopped up because all the other programs running right now require that the data system be chopped up into exactly 8 or 16 or 32 bits.

Now that’s the reason for exact word sizes the binary expansion as in 8bits to 16bits is because now legacy systems can still chop the database up into 8bit sizes without breaking the systems that run on 16 bits. You just treat one word as two words within that applications allocated storage. 

TLDR: all other programs expect a standard word size, so new applications leverage capabilities built on top of those standards. We go from 8 to 16 because 8 bit programs can run still by treating each storage word as two words without running over a single word size allocation, so legacy programs can always run.

Actually, one ""byte"" has historically had different bit values. 

> The size of the byte has historically been hardware-dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. Sizes from 1 to 48 bits have been used.[4][5][6][7] The six-bit character code was an often-used implementation in early encoding systems, and computers using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common in the 1960s.

s7h2vc,ht9znq5,t3_s7h2vc,"Big O notation tells you how much slower a piece of a program gets as the input gets larger. For example:

* Returning the first element of an array takes a constant amount of time. If you double the length of an array, it still takes the same amount of time. That code does not scale with input size.

* Summing all the elements of an array takes a linear amount of time with regard to the length of the array. Double the length, the code takes roughly twice as long. Make the array a hundred times longer, code takes a hundred times as long.

* Searching for an element in a sorted array? If you're using a binary search, every time the array length is doubled you need to add one extra comparison. Performance _does_ get worse as the array length increases, but less than linearly.

The ""notation"" of Big O notation is just concise shorthand for describing the above patterns. O(1) for constant time, O(n) for linear time (where `n` is the length of the array), O(log n) for logarithmic time, etc.

The focus of Big O notation is on looking at the biggest trend of an algorithm. We don't care whether an algorithm takes 200 steps or 201 steps, we just care about how it scales as input size changes. Therefore, we only look at the slowest part of an algorithm. O(n + 1) simplifies to O(n), because as the array size gets millions of times longer the O(1) is quite insignificant.

Outside of coursework you will very rarely, if ever, need to do a formal proof to demonstrate the Big O of an algorithm. Instead, you're being taught Big O notation now so that you can easily reason about algorithms and data structures in the future. ""Oh, I should use a hash table here instead of a tree, because random element access is O(1) instead of O(log n).""

Say we both have created algorithms to solve some problem.

And suppose it turns out that although your algorithm takes longer (I'm making the assumption that yours takes longer only because you asked me to assume you are dumb).

Now the question is how much longer your program takes to run than mine. Maybe on some input your program took 5 times as long as mine to run. That's useful information, but to more thoroughly compare our algorithms we have to see how it performs when we have large inputs.

There are two types of scenarios that come to mind:

\- Scenario type 1: Your program takes at most 10 times as long as mine to run, regardless of how large the input is.

\- Scenario type 2: I can't put a bound on how long your program takes compared to mine, because as we take larger inputs the ratio between the time your program takes and the time my program takes just keeps growing larger.

These cases are quite useful to differentiate between. They're saying something we should deem very important about the efficiency of our algorithms. Instead of starting off running our algorithms and computing the ratio between our running times for various inputs, we should first ask whether there would be a maximum ratio at all.

If there is no ratio (because it keeps growing), then we say that your algorithm's running time is NOT O(my algorithm's running time).

If there is a maximum ratio, then we say that your algorithm's running time is O(my algorithm's running time).

\--- Usage ---

If you're trying to create an algorithm, instead of computing exactly the number of steps it takes, it is better to get an estimate just using O() notation.

Let's take bubble sort with an array of size n. It can take many passes through the array to finish sorting, but not more than n passes. So overall it is taking around n\^2 steps. Do I care about whether it is 0.5n\^2 or 5n\^2? Yes, but not yet! Firstly it is definitely not taking more than 20 steps every time it moves between elements. So it takes at most 20n\^2 steps. The ratio between the number of steps and n\^2 is never larger than 20, so the running time of bubble sort is O(n\^2).

Before we pin down bubble sort's number of steps, let us first see if we can get an algorithm that takes O(n\^1.5) steps, or let's even see if bubble sort actually takes O(n\^1.5) steps. That would be a better guarantee. This is the larger, more important question to pursue.

You can prove that bubble sort does NOT actually run in O(n\^1.5) steps. This means that if somebody comes up with a complicated algorithm that takes 10000 n\^1.5 steps, that will still be better than bubble sort (because if bubble sort actually takes only 10000 n\^1.5 steps we would say it runs in O(n\^1.5) steps).

Now you need to use things like hammers, brushes, cleaner fluid etc. When you are hanging there midway through a building, the tools you have access to fastest are the ones you carry in your hand. You dont need any extra time to use them. Your hands are like CPU registers. Fastest but limited space, your hands can only hold so many tools.

Say if you come across a difficult to clean spot that your current tools cannot be used for. Then you can carry some less frequently required but still important tools in your pockets. You will need some time to use it because you will have to empty your registers(hand) and take out the required tool from your pocket and you may need to search which pocket you kept it or you just remember (associative memory) which pocket carries which tool. This is the CPU cache (level 1). Your pocket too cannot hold too many tools so you may keep some on a backpack/toolbox that you carry with you, you will need more time again to take out the tool from there because you have to open and close the toolbox and replace something in your hand. But a toolbox allows you to carry a bit more than you your pockets. This is still cache but level 2 cache, slower than level 1 (pockets) but have more memory. A cpu can have L3 cache as well. (For this we would neee to talk about multiple workers (cores) sharing a common big tool box).

Next say you need some thing that is used even less frequently that you generally dont bother taking with you on person, however it still happens enough that you need to use it atleast a couple times per building, so instead of taking it with you on person you take it in your platform that you use to go up on, in this way if you need the tool you dont have to go all the way to the ground to get it, this is like RAM, much slower than cache you had to get down a bit to reach your hanging platform to reach it swap out some things and then carry it back up. Remember for registers and cache you didnt have to climb down. But is still pretty fast. And have way way more capacity than cache (toolbox or pockets).

Then sometimes it maybe so that you didnt prep well and left somthing in the garage/workshop below. But if you need something like that you MUST come all the way down take the thing and go back up. This is your disk, you have a huge space (workshops on the ground can be as big as you want) but you have to come all the way and go back.

s6mxkp,ht67cp1,t3_s6mxkp,"Shipping and transport is a more fitting analogy. Cargo ships are slow and cumbersome, but they can move huge volumes of goods across the world. Upon arrival though, goods from one ship needs to be distributed across many cities. It'd be hugely disadvantageous to use ships for distribution from city to city because of how big and slow they are.

Therefore, that task would fall to the next in the shipping volume hierarchy: 18 wheeler trucks. They may have 1/10,000th the volume of a ship, but they're much more nimble. Highways are accessible to them, allowing them to go between cities.

Once the goods arrive at a warehouse or a shipping facility at some city, even smaller trucks or vans are required for delivering goods to individuals because imagine waiting for an 18 wheeler to navigate through your neighborhood.

At each level in the hierarchy, you're sacrificing volume to be more nimble and accessible, which is analogous to bandwidth vs latency. L1 cache has the lowest bandwidth but also the lowest latency. Which means it's capable of moving small pieces of data to registers, and doesn't make the CPU wait very long (a few clock cycles). Whereas the L3 has the highest bandwidth and the highest latency, probably dozens of clock cycles. It's good at loading in big chunks of data from the RAM, and parts of it to L2 but that operation takes say dozens of clock cycles.

The point of having this hierarchy at all is that RAM is actually very slow compared to CPUs. CPUs have hit GHz a bit over 2 decades ago, which means that some operations can be completed in 1ns or less. However, RAM requires many nanoseconds to be read from and written to even today, and if the CPU waited for it all the time then it'd be irrelevant to have faster clock speeds. The cache hierarchy is an attempt to bypass this limitation of RAM. Since L3 is bigger than L2 and L2 is bigger than L1, you can think of L3 as basically a slice of the contents in RAM, L2 as a slice of L3, and L1 as a slice of L2. This arrangement basically arms the CPU with data that a running program might need in the near future so that you don't incur the penalty of waiting on the RAM for every little memory access, only every now and then. This only works because RAM is read in parallel and that it has the bandwidth to feed the L3 cache, but not the latency to feed the CPU's registers.

This arrangement also causes things like data accesses in arrays to be faster than structures like linked lists because in an array, data elements are directly adjacent to one another, which provides greater probabilities that the subsequent elements are already loaded in the cache. Whereas with linked lists, this node might be in the cache, but the other nodes may be randomly scattered throughout memory, and each node access would then require waiting on the RAM",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1642511324.0

Do you base it on some paper? My understanding of BNNs is that they are used for some kind of regularizations to prevent overfitting. If I understood your problem correctly then this problem while close its still not the same as your problem and ill explain.

In most methods, we assume our data came from some probability distribution and we wish to ""say smart things"" about said distribution from only those samples.

Overfitting essentially means the algorithm does not understand the overall distribution from the samples, and think they came from a much more specified distribution. This problem is often very hard to deal with and some sophisticated methods are used. 

But on the other hand, the ability to understand *different* distributions through the data is something else. For example, if i teach my network to classify animals but gives it only dogs, what it does when shown cat is unpredictable - it might classify as animal because it look somewhat similar to the dog (the distribution we sampled the data from) or it might think its not from the distribution and classify as not an animal.

The problem I'm looking at is creation of false positives due to the system not understanding what it is seeing. Going back to the reading that suggested that BBNs could assist with that (The Alignment Problem by Brain Christian), the idea was that an ensemble of modals using Bayesian uncertainty would likely disagree with each other when faced with anything far from the data with which they were trained. 

We can use this degree of consensus or lack of consensus to indicate something about how comfortable we should feel accepting the models guess. We can represent uncertainty, in other words, as *dissent*.

This would be particular useful if a false positive could have dire consequences or in a situation were the available training data was limited or couldn't possibly take into account the complexity of the situation where the AI would be operating.

SVD can be used to compress the wavefunction |Ψ⟩ of a quantum mechanical system expressed in the [Matrix Product State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) formalism (or tensor networks, more generally). Loosely speaking, SVD is used to [split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_decomposition) a system into two parts, say U and V, which gives |Ψ⟩ = |U⟩S|V\^T⟩. Here the singular values in S encode the quantum entanglement between U and V.

The compression is done by discarding small (< 1e-10, say) singular values in S (together with corresponding columns/rows in |U⟩ and |V\^T⟩). This effectively removes unimportant entanglement information from |Ψ⟩. [Repeating the procedure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3477) on all possible partitions of the system, creates a low-rank approximation of |Ψ⟩ which can be accurate under a few (but important) circumstances.

Since the data required to describe a quantum systems of N particles would otherwise scale exponentially (e.g. 2\^N for spin-1/2), this SVD procedure is key to pushing the limit when simulating large quantum systems on classical computers.",5,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,1642440487.0

s5tfpw,ht07s8r,t1_ht037jq,"So I think you might have a slight misunderstanding of how Neural Networks function. Well to begin with, the type of network you'd use to build a reinforcement learning model (which you'd train to learn something like chess) is vastly different from one which would generate pixel data (which in your scenario could be a model which predicts the next frame of a game based on input)

For the first type, there's almost never any visual data being passed to the network. The input is in the form of an array (data type could vary but let's just assume this for now) which summarises the current state of the game; and the output could be something like a simple integer which would dictate the model's next move. There's then a reward function which evaluates how good or bad the output move is, which can then be used to tweak the model's parameters for the next iteration of the model's training. This sort of net could definitely be played against in a video game, but not really in the manner you're describing. Think of it as being able to train an AI adversary within the game, rather than creating the entire game itself. The entire game engine, visual assets etc. would still be required to interpret the model's output and put them in the game. This sort of thing has already been done with chess and a few other games. Now one additional thing since you've mentioned Doom Eternal; the more complex the mechanics of the game, the harder it's going to be to setup a good enough model to play it. Afaik we're definitely not at a point where we can create a model to be a player of a game like Doom Eternal.

Now for the second type of model, one where you'd predict the next frame of a game based on a starting frame and any input. This sort of model is theoretically possible today, but it's going to be almost impossible to meaningfully train it to function as a game. This is more in the realm of procedurally generating frames. You wouldn't be able to program any rules/mechanics/levels of any sort into the game to begin with, the network will merely come up with what it thinks should come next based on what it's seen before during training. There's also the problem that this sort of process might work for a few frames but will soon fall into chaos; this is because after a few frames, the original output frames will then need to serve as input, and the general entropy from the unpredictability of the output will be magnified exponentially. Also as a bit of a footnote, a game like Doom Eternal is not going to be feasible for this sort of approach; all of the problems I've highlighted will be exacerbated proportional to the complexity of a single frame of the game.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1642398553.0

It wouldn’t be 8 “bits”, but maybe we could call them 8 “dits”. An 8 dit system would then be able to process a 10^8 value (100M) in a single instruction (I’m oversimplifying here but the principle holds). A binary computer would need a 27-bit architecture to achieve the same.

Semiotik? Model theory? Stachowiak? 
Words are only sounds, without a human interpretation they are indeed meaningless. But here, in a discussion about what is computer science, we have to think in different levels of abstraction, a different granularity when looking at the details, the relation and the dynamics with which a concept is connected. And in a context like this, the subject of computer science, I think that one can expect more than a linear simplified form of classification to answer this question.

Does anyone object when someone asks software engineering questions here? Why are you working in a professional title but with a software engineering job? It is not simply black and white, even if that is easier and more convenient.

It is very natural and human to create taxonomies and this is the basis for what is ""true"" for us. In the end, however, it remains only a simplification of reality, a way for our human mind to grasp the potentially infinite complexity of reality, which always remains an incomplete representation. And because we see this image as true, things that say otherwise are false, an attack on our world order that makes us quite aggressive because we want to stand up for what we think is right. This leads us to exclude those who think differently, for example by talking about you and us and automatically implying that you are not part of us. Someone who says he has a scientific background knows that this kind of exclusion has troubled so many of the people we honour today, throughout their lives, and only because people insisted that their concepts were not the one of ""us"".

In the end, however, it remains what it is, a simplification, not a truth. And that's why I prefer the term perspective. And I am very glad that we are having this discussion at this level ""where"" I am from.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1642344015.0
s4k68d,hswkzp4,t1_hswk4ou,">Why are you working in a professional title but with a software engineering job
 
Because people who aren't in the computer science or software development fields don't understand the distinction, yet write the job titles for those fields. Same reason why programmers get asked to fix hardware.
 
This is not a philosophical question, it is a question of what the community of practice has defined as different things over decades of communication. Again, you can choose to run off and use your own definitions, but you self-exclude yourself from that community and generally make yourself a nuisance when you impose your incorrect definitions upon that community.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1642344425.0

So we can agree that in general, in the non-professional environment, these issues are not differentiated. We are ""computer people"". But the perspective that I follow and that we also try to build our curriculum around and make first-year students understand what their computer science degree consists of is a variety of disciplines in the field of computer science. Even if we exclude SE from this consideration. With a computer science degree, will what you do simply be computer science? No, it is the specialisations that we have chosen. Visualistic, machine learning, digital signal processing, etc. are all directions in computer science that are so broad in themselves that we consider them as a separate field. To unite all this under the term computer science is just as inappropriate as asking a programmer to repair hardware. 

This is not only the case with CS, but also with SE, CE and all other categories that were defined in the 90s. This classification is the result of a knowledge-based education where I dont say its right or wrong. It treats computing as a meta-discipline a collection of disciplines having a central focus of computing. But even this classification now recognises that these disciplines are intertwined. In particular, SE and CS have a massive overlap in the theoretical part of ""application technology"", ""software development"" and ""systems infrastructure"". The ""community"" has been classifying CS for 10-15 years in such a way that almost all aspects of CS are relevant to SE. And rightly you will say that someone who has spent the same time focusing on more theoretical content will probably be more competent in this field than someone who has spent time in both theoretical and application.

And that is also the reason why I do not like this classification. It is simpler but loses important details that are relevant for example in a job profile. I prefer a classification based on competences. Here, knowledge, skills and disposition are considered in the context of computer science without a separation into disciplines. And we have already defined in 2017 which elements of disposition, cognitive skills and computing knowledge are useable for this classification. The resulting profiles are much more complex but much better suited to describe people or activities.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1642351895.0

s4frba,hsrtfwa,t3_s4frba,"I'm not sure I entirely agree with the assumption that any other well-known machine learning method outside of deep learning isn't ""effective"".

Deep learning is pretty much by definition based on artificial neural networks. So, 1/1 of the base methods used for deep learning are, in some sense, inspired by nature (at least originally).

However, for smaller amounts of data or for data with more linear relationships between variables, things like support vector machines may still be completely reasonable. If the phenomenon being modeled is linear or close to linear, a linear model might even well perform better than a nonlinear one such as an ANN, at least if you don't have a crapton of training data. (edit: and nearly all of these other methods are *not* inspired by nature.)

Also, as far as genetic algorithms go, are they actually one of the ""two most powerful"" machine learning methods? I may be a bit out of the loop, but genetic algorithms used to be one of those methods that sound appealing and may get a lot of hype but which often don't necessarily perform that well, or at least not necessarily better than other simpler and less computationally intense methods do.

I've seen some of that hype for GAs appearing again e.g. on Reddit in recent years but I'm not sure that attention is actually warranted. Again, I may be out of the loop, so perhaps GAs have actually enjoyed some kind of a significant rise in real performance along with neural networks recently. Since I'm not aware of that actually happening, though, I'm inclined to think of it as mostly hype, and I wouldn't count GAs as another data point towards effective machine learning being naturally inspired. I'd be happy to be shown wrong by someone in the actual know.

You might want to ask whether there are other methods beside ANNs that could be used for a layered approach that integrates some kind of feature learning, kind of similarly to deep learning. That's a good question, to which I don't know the answer.

The power supply will simply give your computer power to work. It does not dictate the clock freq or anything like that.

What exactly a computer does is very complicated, but a simple abstraction is a von neumann architecture. This is not at all whats happening behind the hood but thats what the hardwere wants you to see.

The tldr of von neumann architecture is that for every instruction (the ones the compiler breaks the high level program into) the cpu goes through five steps:

Fetch, where the cpu gets the instruction. Decode is where the cpu understand the cmmand. Execute is where the computation happen. Memory is where you read from the memory (ram) to get data you need for the instruction and write-back is where the results are stored in the registers or memory.

Your code does not go to the ram, but your cpu reads and write to the ram in order of executing instructions.

Writing hardwere (and checking it) is not an easy task at all. This is done by splitting the actual hardwere into many separate parts that should work indepentently and combining it all.

An hardwere engineer wont usually deal with transistors but would write in what looks like code (hdl) and use basic building blocks to create the whole piece.

Essentially (its a bit more complicated, but thats the jist of it) when you run a program the pc would point to the location of the first instruction the compiler made from your code. When the pc is there, all it do is just do the usual 5 steps until theres nothing to run from your program and it does some sort of branch to where it was before it ran your program.

s1yfl6,hsbhqnf,t3_s1yfl6,"Edit: sorry for the formatting I am writing on phone. By hardware I guess you mean chips. Well like someone said the design and production/fabrication are two different things.
ARM designs the chips but does not produce the physical chips. You can learn design online, and with degrees. We use computers to design as well. We ""program"" our logical requirements like need 5 ALUs here, have a bus there following the infinity fabric protocol etc in something like verilog which them gives us a schematic with respect to logic gates.
The final implementation and production of the chips are actually in the domains of semiconductor electronics, nano tech, chemical engg and material science. The main technique used is known as photolithography. There is only ONE company in the world that makes the Machines to do photolithography and all the fabs buy from it.
The general basic process follows: (this is outdated now)


- You get your raw silicon

- process them into ingots (cylinders)

- cut them into thin round wafers

- Polish them

- You then use the output of the verilog design to make a mask.
A mask a generally a flat face of something that can block light, and you then cut the mask into the shape of a circuit (2D) to allow some spaces in between where the wires/transistors would be.


- you place the mask on top of the silicon wafers

- You use that mask and use high powered light to melt away the some of the silicon that is under the gaps of the mask.

- in the newly created spaces you add some impurities like gallium or aluminium through electron vapour diffusion(not sure if that was the correct name I am forgetting some stuff) or some other techniques to dope the silicon so that it is more or less conductive.


- what this does is creates transistors PNP or NPN FETs(field effect transistors) at the wafer level.

- then it is layered with some other layers depending on the fab.

- there can be layers of masks and multi layer designs to improve efficiency. 

- a single silicon wafer will have many cpus/chips.


- there will always be chips that will have defects in them because we are dealing with such a small scale. Those chips either are either discarded or more commonly sold as lower tier products with the bad/defective circuits burned off.


- The use of light is also the reason why crossing the 1nm barrier would be so difficult apart from electron tunneling.

I hope this somewhat explains it.

s1yfl6,hsbwnbp,t3_s1yfl6,"There’s 2 main processes:

Photolithography is used to create semiconductors and chips. This is an optical and chemical process which will imprint certain doping patterns onto semiconducting material along with copper interconnects. This is essentially a tiny circuit, you can make transistors, diodes, resistors and some very limited values of capacitors and inductors in this process. Conductive pins which reach outside the chip casing provide access to certain points in this circuit. Production falls under physics, chemistry and solid state physics, design falls under electrical engineering, these usually aren’t done by the same company.

Printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication is used to create finished boards with all their components including chips, resistors, transformers, connectors, capacitors, inductors etc etc. Similar to semiconductors this also uses photolithography to create the copper traces on the board, along with a host of various CNC machines for drilling holes, cutting edges, placing components. There’s various high volume ways of soldering the components to their pads such as wave soldering or reflow ovens. Production falls under mechanical engineering and a little bit of chemistry, design falls under electrical engineering, again usually not done by the same company but larger companies will spin their own PCBs because a PCB fab house is much cheaper to run than a semiconductor fab.

Other kinds of components all have their own specialized manufacturing method, for example a USB connector is a cleverly folder piece of sheet aluminum. A capacitor is two conductive plates separated with a layer of ceramic insulator. A transformer is enameled copper wire wound around a ferrite core. A crystal oscillator is a finely cut piece of quartz with two metal plates on each side. Etc etc.

For a first course any top rated course with many hours of video would do.
By the time you are done with that you'll know what you want to do next. For getting industry jobs, you can maybe start with FPGA.

We were allowed to assume 1ns per gate; our design was able to run at 16MHz.  Good times.

But honestly from the perspective of CS it really doesnt matter how the logic is implemented physically. CS starts at the logic level. If tomorrow we change from semiconductors to say carbon nanotubes provided we have the same TTL layer (transistor transistor logic) we can run the same programs on it even though the underlying implementation is completely different. Thats the beauty of abstraction and the reason you dont need to be an electronics expert to design chips. Because chip design and verilog generally abstracts out the transistor layer.
If you know your digital logic. All you need to know to understand the basics is how photolithography can be used to make things like transistors, diodes, resistors. Once you got your logic gates everything else comes by copy pasting.
So what you REALLY want to understand is at the semiconductor level how we make transistors. And for that if you are already in uni you could probably take a digital circuit design class or semiconductor electronics class.

s14xir,hs731a3,t3_s14xir,"I learned the most about computation from reading Leslie Lamport. Something about his style is simpler than a lot of CS authors. I love this paper:

[Computation and State Machines](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/state-machine.pdf) 

It basically has everything in one place, though it is a little dense if you aren’t on practice with a lot of discrete math. The first two chapters in [Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf) give the best introduction to the subject. The book is great too, again focusing on what computation is at its core vs. talking about specific technologies.

Another book that has been eye opening for me is [Concrete Semantics](http://concrete-semantics.org). It’s about programming language implementation with a proof assistant, but it also focuses on what exactly a programming language is and how its semantics is not a fuzzy, informal thing, but a very concrete definition that we can write down and refer to. Programming languages are the foundation of CS. You can’t create or analyze an algorithm without a language for expressing it.

This last one I’m torn with recommending, because it doesn’t have the same readable style as the previous authors, but it’s also pretty much the best one-stop shop for the most modern view of CS: [Formal Reasoning About Programs](http://adam.chlipala.net/frap/frap_book.pdf). I still have to do double and triple takes while reading this book, but it covers so many important topics in one place that it’s invaluable. What I do is, when I don’t understand a section, I at least use it to search for other papers / books on the topic before coming back to it. Which might be the intention of the book anyway.

**Algorithms**

Building intuitions for how to compute efficiently.

The book that everyone else immediately recommends here is CLRS' ""Introduction to Algorithms"". I break from this tradition a bit in that, this was the one text that scarred me the most, mainly because I was wholly unprepared for it when I first went in.

First Course: these texts are geared for a first exposure to the construction + building up intuitions for algorithms.

* Grokking Algorithms - Aditya Bhargava
* The Algorithm Design Manual - Steven Skiena
* Algorithms - Robert Sedgewick
* Algorithms - Jeff Erickson

Analysis of: these texts are a bit more advanced and focus on proving correctness or properties of algorithms

* An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms - Robert Sedgewick
* Algorithm Design - Kleinberg & Tardos
* The Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Dexter Kozen

Reference ""brick"": I've always had a love-hate relationship with this one

* Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein^(not a favorite, but obligated to mention)

--------------------------

**Programming Language Theory**

This is my specialization in undergrad - how to reason about program semantics, how to analyze programs, and how to give type to things. I would recommend at least some algebra before tackling these. Some of the semantics texts may touch on algebraic topology results (e.g. Scott + Domain theory), but the poset / limit constructions are mostly self-contained.

Program Analysis: how to analyze programs

* Principles of Program Analysis - Flemming Nielson
* Principles of Abstract Interpretation - Patrick Cousot
* Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation - Steven Muchnick^(it pretends that it's a compiler text, but it's a static analysis text)
* Data Flow Analysis: Theory and Practice - Sanyal, Sathe, Khedker

Semantics: how to specify + calculate with the semantics of programs (what does it mean?)

* Types and Programming Languages - Benjamin Pierce
* The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: An Introduction - Glynn Winskel
* Foundations for Programming Languages - John C. Mitchell
* Semantics With Applications: An Appetizer - Flemming Nielson
* Formal Languages and Compilation - Morzenti, Breveglieri, Reghizzi

Types: type semantics, & how to encode properties/contracts/proofs into dependent languages like Coq & Idris

* Software Foundations - Benjamin C. Pierce
* Proofs and Types - Jean-Yves Girard
* Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism - Sorensen & Urzyczyn
* Type driven development with Idris - Edwin Brady

--------------------------

**Systems / Compilers**

Compilers: how to write a compiler / interpreter

* Engineering a Compiler - Keith Cooper
* Modern Compiler Implementation in Java - Appel & Palsberg
* Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools - Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman^(not a favorite, but obligated to mention)
* LLVM Cookbook - Pandey & Sarda

Systems: how computer systems are architected, how operating systems are made up, concurrency in action

* The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles - Nisan & Schocken
* Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition - John L. Hennessy
* Linux Pocket Guide - Daniel J. Barrett
* Understanding the Linux Kernel - Bovet, Cesati
* The Little Book of Semaphores - Allen B. Downey
* Java Concurrency in Practice - Brian Goetz

--------------------------

**Numerical Analysis / Mathematical Modelling**

Prereqs: linear algebra + diff eq

* Introduction to Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang
* Linear Algebra and its Applications - Gilbert Strang
* Elementary Differential Equations & Boundary Value Problems - Boyce & DiPrima
* Terrell's Notes on Differential Equations - Robert Terrell

First Course: introduction to numerical analysis + scientific computing

* Introduction to Scientific Computing - Gene H. Golub

* A first course in optimization - Charles Byrne
* Numerical Linear Algebra - Nick Trefethen
* Applied Numerical Linear Algebra - James Demmel

Applied:

* An Introduction to Mathematical Modeling - Ed Bender
* Scientific Visualization: Python & Matplotlib - Nicolas Rougier

Functional PL / Richard Bird: a world where you can do calculations with programs, and learn some category theory along the way

* Learn you a Haskell - Miran Lipovaca
* Real World OCaml - Yaron Minsky
* Introduction to Functional Programming - Bird & Wadler
* Pearls of Functional Programming - Richard Bird

--------------------------

**Learning to read Donald Knuth's TAOCP**

It took me most of undergrad and several years afterwards to work through small parts of the fascicles of volume 4. It led me down a giant detour of analytic + enumerative combinatorics, with complex analysis being the backbone of several of these asymptotic enumeration problems.

Step 1: Learning Discrete Mathematics

* A Course in Discrete Structures - Pass & Tseng
* Discrete mathematics and its applications - Kenneth H. Rosen
* Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science - Donald Knuth
* Concrete Math Companion - Kenneth E. Iverson

Step 2: Enumerative combinatorics

* Visual Complex Analysis - Tristan Needham
* Generatingfunctionology - Herbert Wilf
* Analytic Combinatorics - Flajolet & Sedgewick
* Introduction to the Theory of Species of Structures - Bergeron, Labelle, Leroux

Step 3:

* ???

Step 4: Profit

* The Art of Computer Programming - Donald Knuth^(not a favorite, but obligated to mention)

--------------------------

**Others**

Some other books (in order of ease) that I remember

* LaTeX - Leslie Lamport
* Discrete differential geometry: an applied introduction - Keenan Crane
* Nonlinear dynamics & chaos - Steven Strogatz
* A first course in network theory - Estrada & Knight
* Galois' Dream - Michio Kuga
* Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms - Cox, O'Shea, Little

s0jzi8,hs2xtap,t3_s0jzi8,"A few concepts:

Voltage: voltage is the electrical analog of pressure. It has a value for each point in 3D space, these values can change as functions of time. The voltage at a single point has no meaning on its own, it the difference of voltages between two points which has any meaning. 0v is usually defined as some arbitrary reference point which all other voltages will be compared to.

Node: a node is a continuous path of conductive material, for example a wire. It may branch off in multiple directions. All points on the same node are at the same voltage.

Power rails: two special nodes within the CPU would be the ground rail and the power rail. The ground rail would be the node which is defined as 0v. The power rail has some positive voltage such as 5v or 3.3v. These come from the power supply which will maintain the voltage difference between them. The voltages on these two rails are what defines “logic high” and “logic low”. These are distributed all throughout the CPU.

Transistor: a transistor is a 3 terminal device, meaning there are 3 pins which can each connect to different nodes. A voltage on the 1st pin controls whether the other 2 pins are electrically connected or not.

Logic gate: logic gates are special arrangements of transistors which perform logic operations on the voltages coming from their inputs, and set the voltages of their outputs accordingly. For example a not gate can be built with 2 transistors, one which will connect the output node to the positive power rail when the input node is low, and one which will connect the output node to the ground rail when the input node is high.

So to answer your question, 1s and 0s are voltages on wires. These voltages are set by electrically connecting the wires to the positive or negative terminals of the power supply. These connections are made with transistors, other signals on different nodes tell the transistors when to open or close. Logic is created with special arrangements of transistors.",9,0,0,0,9,False,False,False,1641832730.0

ON OFF OFF ON OFF ON OFF ON
that doesn't mean much to a human. So let's assign them 1s and 0s, that would look like: 
10010101
Now we have numbers. But that still doesn't mean much to an average person so let's convert them from base 2 (binary numbers) to base 10 ( 0-9 number system we learn in grade school).
I won't go into a full lesson on calculating binary but 10010101 = 149.
So we just used a little abstraction to make a group of 8 transitors represent the number 149!

We discuss in an open/closed or 1/0 due to the phyisical properties of the trasistor, control signal (or gate voltage) above some theashold (that depends on the doping and process) you can allow voltage and below it you can not.

Well no, because by themselves transistors don't do anything, not even store values. To do that, you need to combine transistors with each other (and resistors, diodes, capacitors, ..). To do this you build gates and latches that are represented as single black boxes, but are made up of multiple components. With these abstracted components you can then build logic circuits. [Here's](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~best/courses/modules/Transistors2Gates/) a website I googled that shows how to build gates from transistors (this is already a bit abstracted because if you want to build f.e. an AND gate from transistors you need resistors, too).

So without going *too* far, there's levels of abstraction of knowledge. This is a point I think Carl Sagan once famously made when he discussed the answer to the question ""why is ice slippery?"" You can look at a computer at a very low level, for example the level of voltage and current changes in transistors. That is what you have chosen to do, but that decision is arbitrary. It's probably the least abstract level you are comfortable with, but there's no reason to not go deeper and talk about Maxwell and field theory and perhaps quantum mechanics. I don't know, I'm not a physicist. But yes, you are correct when you say that ""transistors represent 1s and 0s"" is false on this level of resolution. But it's a *useful* abstraction. If you actually look at a processor (or any integrated circuits), and you keep zooming in, you eventually end up with transistors so tiny you could fit thousands of them into the cross-section of a human hair. And of course those transistors aren't just connected in series, they are instead configured in latches and gates, in multiplexers, and so on. What ""transistor"" in colloquial speech *means* is really dependent on what you are considering. When somebody says ""transistors represent 1s and 0s"", what they kinda mean is that there are tightly integrated MOSFETs (and other elements) on a chip that are arranged into latches that store state as ""current"" or ""no current"", which can be manipulated by tightly integrated MOSFETs (and other elements) on a chip that are arranged into logic gates and the like. And that's all incorrect and just a different level of abstraction (because what on earth is a ""transistor"" if not a human abstraction over what happens if certain materials are put in very specific configurations within very specific electro-magnetic fields, and what is a ""material"", and so on), so we just say ""transistor"".

> And I still think that transistors aren’t representing any numbers, the numbers are some electricity or voltage or whatever going through a wire.

That's functionally the same thing. They are ""representing"" a bit in that current going through a electro-magnetic field projecting from a wire is understood to encode ""1"", and no such current encodes ""0"".

In the case of PC operating systems (mostly Mac OS and MS-DOS and early versions of Windows) This mostly had to do with design constraints with the hardware that they had to work with at the time. MS-DOS was a derivative of CP/M written for the Intel 8086 and the original Mac OS was written for the 68000. Neither chip had transistors that performed the functions of an MMU (memory management unit) and both operating systems were written with such hardware limitations in mind. They were also written to function in extremely small amount of memory. 

The hardware that both platforms ran on (680x0 series of chips for Mac OS and 80x86 for PCs) did evolve to include an MMU (68020 and 80286/80386) but by then the software ecosystems were very intrenched and new versions of Mac OS/MS-DOS still had to support those older chips for a time.

Contrast that with early versions of UNIX which ran on Mini-Computers which were extremely expensive for the day. Those machines had the hardware that implemented/supported memory protection. With that support in place it was much easier to build a multitasking system with protected memory.

So in short, those features are easier to build when you have hardware to help you with it. Early PC-Class CPU's lacked the hardware to easily support them. Technically I think you could make it work without such hardware if you are determined enough but I would imagine may deciding to wait for MMU support to be standard on CPUs before implementing it.

rzqau2,hrz9nt4,t3_rzqau2,"The ""meaning of life"" is too abstract a concept, it should be posted on a philosophy sub.

As for CS' ""purpose,"" you should ask yourself how the ""man made"" fields of study came to be. For instance, was math invented or discovered? The general consensus seems to be that it is both; math is the quantification of naturally occurring phenomenon, but requires the invention of a proof (or something along these lines).

In the same vein, electrical engineering is the demonstration of man's mastery of a natural phenomenon (the flow of electrons). Modern computer science has grown out of electrical engineering by combining the ideas of information theory with electrical engineering. 

Now we are seeing the next evolution of this cycle; as computers become fast enough, we see blooming fields like data science and machine learning, that add more abstraction layers on top of CS that allow humans to model complex adaptive systems and gain further insights into the world around us. Basically, as new technologies are discovered, we (humans) gain greater insights into the world around us and gain progressively more tools to model those systems and look past their face value.

So there isn't really a ""purpose"" beyond providing humanity further insights into the world around us, and increasing our collective understanding.

It's pretty simple for me: I like video games (playing and making them), I like robots and I am a huge Sci Fi nerd. Studying CS for me is just studying what some of my favorite things have in common.

For those with a philosophical bent (of which I'm one), the fact that you can simulate things with computers is kind of a big deal. You make models in almost every domain. It's one of the most accessible ways to start tackling big, interesting questions. 

Zooming out further, computers are the latest in a long line of metacognitive tools. A ""Tablet"" is a Clay Tablet's spiritual successor, quite literally and deliberately. Personally, I feel that the tools we interact with are a big part of the human experience and it's neat to be at the fore-front of things. People making the first stone tools might have felt similarly empowered. I like to think that we are still at the front of the computer revolution and that there is a lot of miniaturizing and normalizing left to do. I'd like to ride my bike out into the woods, turn on my AR device, and suddenly have my home office all around me including access to the internet and haptic feedback, and that kind of thing. Right now being a computer person is often like being a person of two worlds (the person at the computer, and the person away from the computer) but I think the technology's logical extreme is a paradigm where you can do computing anywhere and any time, with few restrictions, combining the mobility of ""away from computer"" with the power of ""at the computer"" and applying this combination to every day life. It is really thanks to smartphones and tablets that things are moving in that direction. What is the next step? It's hard not to get excited about the frontier of metacognition. People must have been similarly excited about paper and ink, scrolls and notepads. 

Personally, I want to see what happens when we are applying these fundamentals not only to computers, but to cells. Cells are in theory programmable and certain principles of computing carry over.

Three entities are significant in the NFT world:
- File Hosting Service (IPFS, Google Drive, AWS S3, Dropbox)
- Smart Contracts on blockchains (Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity, Solana smart contracts using Rust, etc)
- NFT Marketplace (OpenSea, etc; they are the platforms that let the bidders bid and they glue together the above-mentioned entities to create their platform)

So let's imagine you are bidding for a cat NFT on OpenSea and finally buy that NFT from the creator after proposing the highest bid. All this bidding game is played on the platform. When you buy the NFT, the code inside a smart contract is triggered which adds a transaction into the blockchain. The transaction serves as proof that you have ""bought"" the particular NFT and are the legitimate owner of the same.

In reality, you do not ""own"" the NFT, you just own the link to the NFT image which is stored on another storage that may be centralized like Google Drive or decentralized like IPFS. If Google Drive decides to remove the particular image from their servers(which is unlikely but assume), you would get a 404 error.

I assume that you know about pointers in languages like C, Rust or Go. So I would explain the above phenomena with context to pointers. Imagine you have a variable `age` and you have a pointer to that variable `elonAge`.
```
int age = 60;
int *elonAge = &age;
```
Let's assume you have the access rights for `elonAge`, you have access rights to `age` but that doesn't mean that you cannot have any more pointers to `age`. You can have another pointer to that same variable called `muskAge`.
```
int age = 60;
int *elonAge = &age;
int *muskAge= &age;
```
You can read the data stored in `age` by dereferencing `elonAge` as well as `muskAge`.

Likewise, if you own a link to an image on the interwebs that doesn't mean that nobody else can't have access to that NFT image. A person named Geoffrey(forgive me if I misspelled the name) recently showed how this works by creating the [NFT bay](https://thenftbay.org) which is the NFT version of The Pirate Bay. 

He demonstrated that he can access the NFT *images* to which the owners have a link by downloading all the NFTs and torrenting them. I heard his talk in a podcast with Coffeezilla iirc. The NFT Bay is now banned in most countries though.

rzcexe,hrwuoth,t3_rzcexe,"The technical part of it is very similar to the idea of cryptocurrency (and works on the same technology of storing a ""ledger"" in a decentralized, online, data structure).  
The thing that distinguishes NFT from cryptocurrencies is that in NFT we give (completely theoretical) value to each individual ""link"" in the chain, whereas in cryptocurrency we give value to a numerical amount of ""links"" like we would with regular currency.

There is no real authority for NFT market shoppers to claim ownership of digital data, that ownership is not technically recognized by any institution in the world (AFAIK) and so basically people who participate in that market just choose to acknowledge that ownership (I believe that mostly because the media decided to play along out of greed, and failed to inform people that it's pretty much make believe, it's like issuing a certificate of authenticity for a molecule of oxygen, sure you could probably capture it, and you might even be able to prove that the tube you keep it in actually holds that same molecule, but as long as no country acknowledges your ability to own said molecule, it's meaningless.

Now, when talking about cryptocurrencies (say Bitcoin) there is usually some form of computational power required to operate the chain, store it's data and deliver it, so if you join in that effort you are essentially rewarded with some fraction of the currency (at least nowadays). The original idea, as I understand it, was a formula (take for example the calculation of pi), that was very computationally intensive, and if you joined in, you had a chance to be the computer that actually got the next number of pi in the calculation - this was called ""Mining"". That number was unique (in terms of it's position in the ""chain"") so when you got the credit for it, you could actually say that your bitcoin is bitcoin number XXX.

When talking about NFT's, pretty much anyone can choose to create a new NFT out of any unique identifier of digital data (specifically hash value), that unique value is stored on the chain, and so when it's ownership transfers it is registered on that chain - that chain of ownership is what the economy of NFTs is based on, you want to own something (as intangible as it is) that was owned by someone else important, or that has some digital history to it, and with blockchain that history, and connection to the original hash value is verifiable",5,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,1641735571.0

The code for the NFT then uses the blockchain  to ensure that only one person can be the owner at any time.

They're overhyped at the moment, but so was the Internet in its early days (dot-com boom) and nobody would deny now the Internet is important. The basic idea - buying and selling stuff other than cryptocurrency over the blockchain - is a good one.

The code for an NFT can be very simple - you can write one in 14 lines. Have a state that keeps track of the owner. Provide an API that transfers ownership if buyer and seller both authorize the transaction, and answers the question ""Who is the owner?"" at any time. The difficult part - keeping this all synchronized globally - is delegated to the blockchain.

This is inexpensive to make, and would probably sell for a couple hundred dollars. Based on this, we can see that tens of millions of dollars of the Mona Lisa's monetary value aren't contained in how it looks. Rather, they're contained in that it is THE original. Using NFTs, one can create a similar ""THE original"" property for a piece of digital art. Namely, they issue a single token for the data of their art. From then on, the owner will have cryptographic-blockchain proof that they are the sole owner of the original token.

Now, considering that NFTs are like art, that makes it so they are a very natural space for bullshit and hype. However, this is just the same phenomenon that takes place in the modern art world. A painted red canvas is worthless, UNLESS it was painted by this one famous person, for example. I personally think that valuing something for being THE original, rather than how it looks, is irrational, both in NFT space, and in real-art space. However it isn't like NFTs are all built on nothing and will pass as a phase. There is just as much merit in valuing NFTs (and therefore reason to expect them to continue to be valuable) as there is in valuing original pieces of art. One can further distinguish whether the NFT has artistic value (ie the apes vs some world renowned digital artist's painting). This is just equivalent to the distinction between a collectible card and a piece of art.

Lastly, it's true that much of paintings' value (but very little proportionally in the case of the immensely valuable ones) is from looking cool. NFTs don't contain any of this value, whereas physical art bundles together the two types of value. This is a meaningful distinction.

Let's say you want the exclusive rights to publish a book. Imagine the US copyright office were to print out your registered copyright and mail it to you. The laws of physics prevent another person from having that exact same printed copy as you, and NFTs do the same for the digital version. The Copyright office could turn around tomorrow and print a second copy of the exact same document and mail it to someone else though, in which case it would be really hard to prove which one of you actually owned the rights to that book or whatever. And in the NFT world, we can just create a second token to the same URL and certify that someone else owns that one. The system prevents two people from having the same ""paper"" claiming ownership. It doesn't prevent two people from having different ""papers"" each claiming ownership to the same thing.

And that's just one problem. A second problem is that no one really recognizes any of this stuff as meaning anything. So maybe you are the only person who owns an NFT that supposedly represents that book. I can just sell copies of the book myself anyway, and there's no mechanism for you to stop me. No government or police agency cares about NFTs. 

You can solve these problems. You can empower some centralized broker to track and enforce everything. But then what's the point of the crypto aspect?

rzcexe,hrytiej,t1_hrxn0ew,"I think that's incorrect though. 
[Non-Fungible](https://nerdschalk.com/what-does-non-fungible-mean/) is a term that has been used in property law for many years, so in order for an **NFT** to be an **Non-Fungible Token**, it cannot by definition be duplicated. 

In your example of creating another token to link to the same URL as the one printed the day before is a really poor use case. I mean its barely worth linking a QR code to a URL. Because **NFTs** are unique objects, the only use cases that justifies their creation is representing or being those unique stores of perceived value - *in some cases an NFT actually endows a once Fungible object with Non-Fungibility*. 

This is why a lot of the use cases are in the arts and entertainment domains but *there are others*...I promise there are. 

What you mention though does make me think about the encoding of an **NFT**, particularly its association with a real-world object. What convinces the guy who just bought an expensive NFT, that another token won't be made the next day to link to his new asset (represented by his token)? 

The fact that the blockchain is immutable, cannot be altered in any way and if someone were to try linking another token to the asset, it would result in some kind of error (probably logical) because there'd already be an association registered on the [distributed ledger](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30246/blockchain) with whatever that asset was. In the cases where an NFT only represents a fraction of an asset, those details would already be coded into the ledger even prior to all of the tokens being *minted*. I don't know though, this is an assumption from my mental model I've yet to verify.

I like art, art is cool and I think it's necessary for society but the use cases that excite me are the ones in which actually, an NFT can now come to represent a **title deed** or someones **last will and testament** and negate the ever present risk of the deeds building burning down or military coup resulting in a total rewrite of relevant country's land ownership.

Plus...I think the primary purpose of the blockchain and its offshoots is to enable peer to peer transactions on an industrial scale without that 3rd party, that almost always adds nothing to the value/utility of the transaction except for a fee and other things. I get that they were/are necessary for providing **the trust variable** to a deal between strangers, but over the years they have gotten a bit too ""big for their boots"", stretching their original mandate and becoming more of a pervasive force so some change in that regard would be nice (namely decentralization which I approximate as more power to the people, and stronger links between them).",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1641762753.0

If you think something is 100% secure and always will be - oh sweet summer child.

There’s a great story in either applied cryptography or secrets and lies. It’s about the DES algorithm; this was developed by IBM, but was sent to the NSA. They sent it back with some modifications, but nobody knew *why* they were needed. Years later, a researcher published  new form of attack - which it transpired that DES in its original form was more suspectable to. The NSA had modified it because *it already knew about* the attack.

The question is; what do you think the NSA knows about the algorithms utilised in the current implementations? Who knows, but I’m sure it’s more than the outside world.

The network is *secure* as long as enough nodes aren’t compromised; if enough nodes are compromised then the network is foo barred. The network has to be large enough to reduce the possibility that a single attacker could compromise enough of it. We know that computers can be hacked (it was one of your reasons for liking NFTs) so these nodes could be compromised. It would take a huge amount of resources to comprise enough nodes - and this isn’t worth it. But it’s possible.

However the likely attack is attacking the end user, stealing the wallet and all it contains. What’s brilliant about this; it’s it’s totally your fault and all your money/possessions are now irreversibly lost.

Business people and non-engineers with no idea how computers work or the nuances of computer science and software will never be able to capture the requirements and edge cases of the thing they desire. People are also very bad at knowing what they actually want. This takes professionals to do this work.

I know that if you add 12 hours to a time, it remains the same, it does a full 360 degree rotation around the clock.

So I’m going to pick two numbers, x and y, such that x+y=12. If I take any time, and add x, then add y to it, it will be the same time.

So I tell everybody what x is, that’s my public key.

When they want to send me a time m, they first add x to it and then send me m+x. Let’s pretend subtraction is extremely difficult, infeasible for anybody to do. So somebody listening into our communications will know m+x, but they don’t know m because they have a hard time subtracting x from m+x.

When I receive this message, instead of trying to subtract x, I’ll just add y instead, which gives me m+x+y=m+12=m, I now have the original unencrypted message. y is my private key which is a secret only I know.

Nobody else can do this because in order to find out what y is, they would need to compute y=12-x, and remember subtraction is difficult.

This is essentially how public key encryption works, a public/private key pair are generated to have the mathematical property that application of both, yields the original message. It also needs to be extremely difficult to compute one from the other.

In the case of RSA this would be based on modular exponentiation and prime factorization.

Modular exponentiation means m^x mod n, for some choices of n, we can find two numbers e and d, such that m^ed = m mod n, for any m. e and d are like x and y, e will be the public key which the sender will use to compute m^e mod n, which is incredibly hard to undo. d will be my private key, which I will use to compute (m^e )^d = m mod n, this is like completing the full circle around the clock and arriving back at the original message. All public key encryption is based on these “circular” type operations, a full cycle takes you back to the original message, this is broken down into two steps, one for the sender and one for decryption, the sender makes a partial cycle, which is incredibly hard to undo, the receiver however knows some secret to complete the cycle.

In order to find d from the public knowledge, which is e and n, you need to prime factor n. However n is a very large multiple of two prime numbers, n = pq.

rw311s,hrjhmdt,t3_rw311s,"It depends.

If `my_var` is on the stack, then its address increments/decrements (depending on the CPU architecture) as new variables are allocated. The CPU has a register to track the latest stack location in memory (called a stack pointer), and the compiler knows how much to add/remove from this register to reserve space in the memory for new variables.

For example, if I create two local variables (local variables get created on the stack), then their addresses should differ by the size of those variables, possibly rounded up to the nearest word. `long` is equivalent to one word or its multiple on most OS so there shouldn't be any rounding in this example:

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        long on_stack1;
        long on_stack2;
    
        std::cout << ""Address of on_stack1: "" << &on_stack1 << std::endl;
        std::cout << ""Address of on_stack2: "" << &on_stack2 << std::endl;
        std::cout << ""The difference in the address should be "" << sizeof(long) << "" bytes"" << std::endl;
    
        return 0;
    }

The value of the stack pointer is initially set by the OS when the program starts.

If, on the other hand, `my_var` is on the heap (e.g., created with `new`), then the address is dynamically allocated by the memory allocator (which comes with the C/C++ library for the OS) so how it allocates the memory depends on the allocator's algorithm. To avoid the heap's memory allocator accidentally using the memory used by the stack, the allocator tries to reserve heap memory on the ""opposite"" end of the memory address from the stack as far away from it as it can. You can see a typical memory layout here: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/)

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        long on_stack;
        long* on_heap = new long;
    
        std::cout << ""Address of on_stack: "" << &on_stack1 << std::endl;
        std::cout << ""Address of on_heap: "" << on_heap << std::endl;
        std::cout << ""The address of on_heap should be far from on_stack."" << std::endl;
    
        return 0;
    }

If you use a lot of memory it is possible for the stack to crash into the heap. And it is possible for a memory allocator to fail to allocate a large chunk of memory even if there are many small pieces of memory due to memory fragmentation. A part of the memory allocator algorithm's goal is to minimize such memory fragmentation.

Also, if `my_var` is a global variable or a constant, the compiler reserves a space for it within the binary so that when the program is loaded into the memory the variable is already reserved an address. Its address can be calculated as the starting address of the program + offset to the variable in the binary.

    #include <iostream>
    
    const char* on_global = ""You should see this string in the binary"";
    
    int main() {
        std::cout << ""Address of a constant: "" << (void*)on_global << std::endl;
        std::cout << ""Address of a global variable: "" << &on_global << std::endl;
    
        return 0;
    }

As others have pointed out, modern OSes, with the assistance of modern CPU architectures, use virtual memory so the addresses printed out by the above programs are not the memory's physical addresses. There exists a memory mapping mechanism to use the memory more efficiently and protect one program's memory from each other. I like these videos for understanding virtual memory: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBIvnQt0Bw&ab\_channel=DavidBlack-Schaffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBIvnQt0Bw&ab_channel=DavidBlack-Schaffer)",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1641501927.0

A single clock cycle is the shortest period of time within which you expect anything to happen within the CPU. It's the resolution of time for the CPU, in a sense.

It takes time, however brief, for electrical signals to propagate within the CPU. It takes time for transistors to switch.

When the CPU runs, say, an instruction to add two integers together, it does that by passing current through a logic circuit that produces the correct output bits from the input bits. The output is not instantaneous. Rather, the CPU would check the output at the next clock cycle (or possibly after a set number of clock cycles).

Regarding the frequency at which bits move around in a CPU; what is quoted as the CPU's clock frequency has some relationship to the rate at which bits move around, but that's missing the point of why there is a clock in the first place (which isn't to describe the rate at which bits move around). The reason why there's some relationship is because there will be parts of the CPU where data being moved to different parts, or processed, at the same rate as the clock frequency.

First, even if we are leaving composition over inheritance to later, by introducing it that way the misunderstanding you invite causes repeated breaches of the Liskov substitutability principle, because students learn to model their code based on the taxonomy in the real world, which is completely wrong.

Inheritance is not an 'is a' relationship from the real world, that is a gross oversimplification by people who didn't know what inheritance was for. The classic counterexample is square and rectangle - [see this talk by Bob Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHiWqnTWsn4&t=4430s).
 
Rather than modelling the real world behaviour of things in classes, it is far better to approach classes for what they actually are - collections of **software behaviour**. That way you never fall into the square-rectangle trap, but you still arrive at the shape-square and shape-rectangle behaviour (which is also in that talk, it's a good one to watch start to finish).

There are 3ish schools of thought on when they should learn OOP at all, objects-first, objects-early, objects-late. If they are objects-late, then you can give them whatever you like, because they can craft some decent procedural code and you can build on those concepts. Remember that there was a point in time where *everybody* learning OOP was in this category.
 
If they are objects-early, then they already know enough that you can draw out objects and a class structure motivated by the behaviours they already know about. A Zork clone is more than sufficient, which you can learn enough programming to create (procedurally) in a day or 2 boot camp. Rooms, exits, items in the rooms, etc. Easy peasy, and you can even show them the flaws in creating an inheritance structure based on is-a real world relationships when you do so, by comparing your 'what common behaviours do we want to bundle' vs 'let's model a maze in real world concepts' versions. It doesn't need to be 'real life' code, it needs to be real motivations from the software, even if that software is trivial.
 
If they are objects-first, then the best thing to do is give them a scaffold with a canvas object and do shapes. You can do this with BlueJ in the first hour they are at a keyboard.
 
If you are teaching them any other way, then what you have almost certainly been blinded by is the **syntax** of OOP, which is both the easiest and stupidest thing to teach a newbie student. Yes, they'll need to know the syntax of whatever language, they'll need to learn how access modifiers work, they'll need to understand scope, etc etc etc. But that is all crap they can learn by breaking things along the way, and is a distraction from the more useful starting concepts.

It's important to point out its usually a package, because it's packed up- a lot of data is compressed and in the case of online installers much of the data is omitted in favor of a downloading protocol for the data from an online server. Think Steam download, but for a single game or software. I would say this is the most common method for modern installers and why they can be smaller than a hundred megabytes.

For some, it is a fully packed software (offline installers), but these are often very large and tell the software how to decompress and reassemble itself.

A lot of libraries can be omitted because they come pre-installed or previously were and require separate downloads (think C++/.NET redistributables) which are shared between many apps.

Games usually only package the engine and boiler plate code and basic art (in the case of installers), then patches and more complex art assets are downloaded online as updates.

Given A • B = C, the proper way to do it is by first decomposing one of the factors, say A, into a sum of powers of two. Then multiply B by each decomposed component of A, accumulating the result into C. Because the components are all factors of two, each multiplication ends up being a simple bit shift, which makes the algorithm perform in the order of O(log n).

now consider both these CPUs want to load want to read something at address 0x0001-0x0004 the 8bit CPU will be able to read the address directly from 0x0001-0x0004 onto the memory

rue0sq,hqyhh8j,t3_rue0sq,"Let’s say we have an 8 bit data width CPU, with 16 bit instructions.

It has 16x 8bit general purpose registers.

There are 2x (16 to 1) 8bit multiplexers with the 16x 8bit inputs being the values in the registers. They each have 4 control bits to select which register values end up on the output.

The 2 8bit outputs are fed to an ALU which can do 4 operations: add, sub, and, or. The operation is selected with 2 control bits.

The 8bit output is fed back to the 16 registers, each have a control bit which if enabled, will latch the 8bit value into the register at the end of the clock cycle. These 16 control bits are the output of a 4 to 16 decoder, which is controlled by 4 select bits.

So our CPU can choose any 2 registers from our 16, perform one of 4 operations, and then save the result to any of the 16 registers.

It needs 4 bits to select the 1st operand, 4 bits to select the 2nd, 2 bits to select an operation, and another 4 bits to select which register to save the result in.

So you might have an instruction format which looks like this:

00xxaaaabbbbcccc

Where xx are the 2 bits which select the operation the ALU will perform.

aaaa are the 4 bits which select the register of operand 1.

bbbb are the 4 bits which select the register of operand 2.

cccc are the 4 bits which select which register to save the result in.

When the CPU sees this instruction it will route the relevant control bits to the multiplexers, ALU, and decoder to perform the specified instruction. This is what is meant by decoding the instruction. This is a simple instruction set but real ones are much more complex and require more logic to derive the relevant control bits from any given instruction. The area of the CPU which will do this is called the control unit. It uses the instructions to derive control bits which will control the flow and processing of data in the other components of the CPU such as registers, the ALU, memory, various multiplexers and decoders, bus access, etc.",52,0,0,2,52,False,False,False,1641145316.0

For example (and  I just made this up) if you want to add 5 and 2, and the control unit is set up to add when the first four indices of the instruction equals 2 (or 0010 in binary) then a 16 bit instruction for that could be: 

0010 000101 000010

The control unit would look at the first four values, see a ‘2’, and from there it knows to take the next 6 values and pass them in as the first operand to the ALU, and the last 6 values as the other operand to the ALU.

It doesn't really ""decode"" it as much as the bits split up with circuits and sent in chunks. The command code is one such chunk and the data (more specifically the register number being used) is another one. Flags can also be used.

Now take that analogy and compact it, the gates overlap and the logic behind the gates can be simplified using ors an boolean simplification. Our CPUs are massively simplified to be as compact as possible. Programmable CPUs also exist (as in the command sets can be changed), but that is a lot more complicated.

So basically, a CPU works by reading some list of ""commands"" in Binary code (lines of 0s and 1s).

These commands vary from OS to OS but they can basically be summed up to 3 categories: ""basic mathematical operations"" and ""memory operations"" and ""Jump operations""*.

The memory operations will be things like write num x to an address y in the RAM, or pull up the number in a RAM address and save it to the stack (a dedicated place on the ram, that mathematical operations will take their inputs from).

The mathematical operations will take numerical inputs from the RAM (from the stack) and replace them (on the stack) with the operation's result.

The ""Jump operations"" are taking us back to the first ""list of commands"" for the CPU, as we are all aware, in programming two of the most powerful tools we have are ""loops"" and ""conditions"", these make the difference between flicking switches manually and actually responding to various types of inputs, and being able to make varying computations with the same function - The Jump operations are able to check whether a condition applies (typically ""is the last stack item ==\<\> to 0"" and if that condition applies, the CPU will ""jump"" to a certain command in the list and start pulling the commands from that line to achieve conditional programming and loop iterations.

That is basically how a CPU operates. Hope it helps someone :)",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1641199753.0

At one extreme, you might just save your whole memory image to disk. It would be pretty fast, and you wouldn't need to do anything to your data. For this to work, you probably would need the exact same version of the exact same program on the exact same operating system (and probably a little help from the OS).

At another extreme you could use a text based format like JSON or XML. Everyone knows how to store and transmit text, and standard formats mean it's easy to write libraries that convert them to whatever internal representation your program/language requires. Unfortunately, this process is pretty slow (imagine converting millions of ints into a variable number of characters). It also wastes space. But the up shot is that it's super portable. Even humans can read and understand it!

There are compromises as well. Protobuf is a tool from Google that helps you define how things get serialized and communicated. Two programs have to use the same protobuf definition and version, but they can be written in different languages and run on different OS's.

A slew of recent advances from labs around the world suggests ways that artificial intelligence tools may answer that question. Josef Urban at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics in Prague is exploring a variety of approaches that use machine learning to boost the efficiency and performance of existing provers. In July, his group reported a set of original conjectures and proofs generated and verified by machines. And in June, a group at Google Research led by Christian Szegedy posted recent results from efforts to harness the strengths of natural language processing to make computer proofs more human-seeming in structure and explanation.

People are more predictable than we want to admit we are and most people do pretty specific things in specific situations. What big tech has is a fuck ton of data that shows that if you like X you're extremely likely to also like Y.

Let's say for example Google figures out that you like heavy metal. It isn't wrong to like heavy metal. Some people like heavy metal and some people don't. Then let's say that they figure out that 96% of people who like heavy metal also like cheap beer. What Google knows is that betting that you like cheap beer if you like heavy metal is a safe bet as there's only a 4% chance that they're wrong. So what they then do is work with advertisers who want to sell cheap beer and say ""metal fans like cheap beer, target them."" That isn't individual mind reading; that's just recognizing patterns in human behavior. If you like heavy metal then chances are you're in the 96% that also likes cheap beer. To an individual this might look like mind reading as you get targeted advertisement but it really isn't mind reading. What happens is Google analyzes your patterns, connects them to overall population patterns, and figures out what you like and what you tend to search for. They'll also notice things like people who enjoy heavy metal are extremely unlikely to search for, say, Brittney Spears and are thus not going to recommend her to metal fans.

What they use is machine learning which chews through obscene amounts of data and finds the patterns. It genuinely is just computers doing math and pattern recognition then figuring out ""people who do X are highly likely to also do Y."" There are also certain patterns that most people show in their searches when they're going through certain things or are about to do certain things that are also recognizable.

The other thing is that big tech tracks what you search for and knows what you do and don't like. Yes this is actually kind of creepy and I don't like that they do it but right now it's legal so they aren't going to stop.

If I'm broke as fuck and like cheap tacos it is less likely to show me the most expensive steakhouse in town first.

AI research is a very experimental field that relies on demonstrating empirical results. As with most fields, advancements follow on from previous advancements. Many highly impactful AI papers are just refinements of previous developments. For example, the difference between a ""traditional"" GAN and a Wasserstein GAN (wGAN):

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (Original GAN paper)

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) (wGAN paper)

It essentially uses the same architecture, or at least is basically architecture agnostic when it comes to layers, etc. The important thing was the switch from using minimax Loss which is reliant on cross-entropy between probability distributions, to using the Wasserstein distance instead. This practically speaking solved significant problems like mode collapse.

Also, Deep Learning itself can be kind of counter-intuitive, for example:

[https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30033](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30033)

At least, that's my understanding. This is attributed to Vsauce2. Soon, you get into understanding the different types of reward models and choice models, which are sort of plug and play. Some have a mathematical definition, such as a fitness function or a neural network that makes the choices instead of having a box for every possible state. There's also a few different ways to iterate the model, such as directly manipulating the model, genetically evolving the model, or just randomly changing everything about the model over and over until something happens to work.

On top of my head theres three options, all has their drawbacks and advantages over the other methods. 

One option would be saying that the ranking of last generation is somewhat noisy, in this case you could just treat your old agents just like new ones with the difference of the ranking would be:

r_new(iteration i) = \gamma r_new(iteration i - 1) + (1-\gamma) r_old(iteration i)

With gamma being a parameter of your choice between 0 and 1. 

This method would not decrease the number of evaluations but it would lower your ranking variance which would help your algorithm to converge.

The second method would be building your match tree in such way new agents would always be against old agents.

You can do that by rebuilding your match tree after every round and enforcing new agents would always be against old ones. Eventually you would need to pair old ones against old ones and you would simply take the better agents from last iteration without simulating a match.

This would yield low amount of simulations as you wont simulate old agents against each other, and it would work in the case where all new agents are better then the old ones (after a round the entire match tree would be only new agents), but the drawback being you might lose out new good agent quickly when he would face the best old agent in the first round - not something you want.

The last method comes to mind is somewhat hard to explain. its similar to the second method but instead of using all of the old agents in the first round, the first round you would use the worst half of your agents and all of the new agents. In the second round you would insert the worst half of the remaining agents and so on.

This would work similarly in terms of amount of matches to the 2nd option - this is better for cases where the new generation is not that different then the old one.

That's a fun exercise and those were just methods from the top of my head - there could be better options then i stated.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1640943740.0

You double click gmail to check your messages, while gmail is loading you check your Facebook page, but it's dead, so next you access Instagram.  Now you go back to check your gmail, this is known as Context Switch.  First you opened gmail, the scheduler will grab gmail app and start loading it, but you wanted to see who is on Facebook, the gmail app will go to a wait state and placed in the queue, then Facebook will go active, then you checked Instagram, so Facebook goes to the wait state and placed in queue and Instagram goes active. Then you go back and check your emails.  Now Instagram goes to the wait state while gmail goes to the active state.  
  No matter how it's worded, the CPU can only execute one app at a time.  It can load a program in each core while executing the main program, but it can only run one app at a time, but it will switch to another app in queue if it sees the current app go to a wait state, like waiting for user input.  It can switch between thousands of apps in seconds. 

So you have a scheduler that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

The OS scheduler determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues which can only have one entry per processor core on the system;

Schedulers main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run.


CPU scheduler main objective is to increase system performance, also selects a process among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates CPU to one of them.

Short-term schedulers, also known as dispatchers, make the decision of which process to execute next. Short-term schedulers are faster than long-term schedulers.


Medium-term scheduling  removes the processes from the memory. The medium-term scheduler is in-charge of handling the swapped out-processes
A suspended processes cannot make any progress towards completion. In this condition, to remove the process from memory and make space for other processes, the suspended process is moved to the secondary storage. This process is called swapping, and the process is said to be swapped out or rolled out. Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix.


A context switch is the mechanism to store and restore the state or context of a CPU in Process Control block so that a process execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.

When the scheduler switches the CPU from executing one process to execute another, the state from the current running process is stored into the process control block. After this, the state for the process to run next is loaded from its own PCB and used to set the PC, registers, etc. At that point, the second process can start executing.

This is the basics of a CPU running applications.  There is another task in there I cannot recall at this moment.",23,0,0,0,23,False,False,False,1640843091.0
rrsvuo,hqjoe0s,t3_rrsvuo,"The answer of u/DevilDawg93 is about the OS scheduling, but misses the part about the interaction with I/O devices. To answer your question: there are multiple levels of security in which a CPU can be, mainly the **privileged mode** in which the software can do anything, and the **user mode**, in which the CPU forbids access to the areas of the memory not explicitly allowed, access to I/O devices, use of some instructions, etc.

How it works: when the OS starts booting, it executes in privileged mode. It can organise the memory of your computer whenever it wants, and use some areas in the memory (the RAM) to write some important tables, in which you will find the pages tables (which indicates the regions of the memory on which a process can read and/or write). The OS sets some important registers of the CPU: one is pointing to the **interruption** handler, a function in the OS that can manage interruptions, another to a page table.

When the OS switches to a process, it writes in the special register the pointer to the pages table of the process, switch to user mode, and then jump to the code of the process, letting this process do its stuff. Because the process is in user mode, it can't do anything dangerous (requiring the privileged mode)... but can ask the OS to do it. It can trigger an interrupt (a system call), which will call a function of the OS. The CPU switch to **privileged mode** when it happens, and this is safe because only the OS could have written in the register referencing the interrupt handler. So there is no way (outside a security breach) for the user process to write in another program memory or use the I/O directly, the restriction is built in the CPU itself. The application **must** ask the OS to do it itself, and then the operating system takes the time to check if the application is allowed to do so, or not.

Of course this is a bit simplified view of how it works, modern CPU are very complex, but it still works according to this schema. I should add that switching from one process to another (as described by u/DevilDawg93) works the same: in privileged mode, the OS can configure the hardware clock to send a signal (for example every X µs). Each time the signal is sent, an interrupt is triggered, and so the CPU starts executing OS code in privileged mode. It is up to the OS to save the process state somewhere, set the CPU registers (for the pages table of the next application), load this next process state, switch to user mode and start executing it \[this is the context switch\].",5,0,0,0,5,False,False,False,1640872773.0

Repeatedly pick out the longest stand by putting your hand on top and picking the first one it hits. Since both these hands operations are constant time, you get a linear sorting algorithm!!

Let's do a quick analysis to see where this algorithm, and any ""natural"" algorithms in real life, fall short:

- hands are slow. Where a computer might pick something from memory in a few microseconds, it takes dozens of milliseconds to pick out spaghetti from your hand. That's a hard time limit, since physics prevents the spaghetti from being moved too quickly lest it break.
- there are practical bounds on the length of spaghetti.
- it's hard to hold more than, say, 100 spaghetti strands. Practical sorting will require millions of items to sort.
- in order to make this transferable to and from a computer, the computer has to output spaghetti of certain lengths, or cut spaghetti to a certain length. Beyond the precision required, it's just slow. It might be faster reading the spaghetti, although that may require a computer vision algorithm or some sort of spaghetti index.

So, even though it is a linear time sorting algorithm, practical problems abound around the interface and scaling. I think you'll find those problems anywhere you attempt to use a natural algorithm.

Video game bots (including chess bots), forum (e.g. Reddit) bots, and chat (customer service) bots are all pretty obvious examples but there are less obvious ones too. How long can you drive behind a self driving car on a rainy day before you realize it's autonomous (driving is in many ways communication)? I have had one or two automated robo calls to my phone which took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize were adaptive recordings of some kind (like phone trees, which are also getting really good). There are many games in which it is not obvious that an opponent is a bot.

Basically, I think we are already at the point where the average person is occasionally going to be fooled by a bot impersonating a human. We have long been accustomed to occasionally losing to them at games, although even in victory they are rarely mistaken for human. This is in contrast with the fact that we don't have the kind of artificial general intelligence most people think of when they imagine something passing the Turing test. When it comes to our human ecosystem and the bots (which are not yet ""true"" AIs) which inhabit it, there's already a lot of them out there doing very complex and borderline things (like high frequency trading) which place them in a sort of mixed arena with humans. The expectations of the 1950s are only so useful at the end of the day.

I think it is probable that there is no ""magic line"" after which a thing is ""intelligent"" or sapient or AGI or whatever. We are unimpressed by our current level of accomplishment, but what if we were time travelers from a hundred years ago? Without the finer points of context to help with the distinction, there are a heck of a lot of bots or automatic systems which could easily be mistaken for thinking and willful things. I think that as more and more systems are put in place to make AIs seem intelligent, that line will get crossed without fanfare or anyone having a reason to ""declare"" it crossed. Some day we will all be having cogent, deep, complex, back-and-forth, intelligent conversations with our phones or desktops or cars, and people will still be wondering ""is AGI here yet? What about the Turing test?"". Perhaps instead of a fine line we can observe the stepping across of, we should think of it as a large and fuzzy zone, with us in the middle of it somewhere. People will always be able to point to a seemingly intelligent program and say ""aha, that's just mechanistic"" but at a certain point you are making very philosophical arguments about the meaning of emergence through mechanism by attempting to disprove the alleged intelligence of a program.

Me too, most of the time, but it's getting to the point where I have
on several occasions been unsure if it would be okay to hang up or not
because the robocall was so convincing (on one occasion even replying to me like one of those ""speak to me"" phone trees). It has gotten me thinking about what a future world would be like in which you had to take for granted that sapient processes were all around you, in any given object that could be programmed. In such a world you might adopt a policy of politeness towards objects that would seem highly unusual (to put it bluntly) to someone from, say, Victorian Europe. I already say ""please"" to my Google Voice just because it's healthy to build those reflexes when using your communications muscles, so how much more interesting and nuanced in a few more years when the world is full of systems which are ""close enough to intelligent"" to make you think about your social reflexes when dealing with a machine?

>So far I'm not ready start giving my toaster or candlesticks ""rights.""

I'm not convinced it will ever ask for them, honestly, no matter how far these things go. You may not want to give your candlestick rights, but at what point do you begin to offer it politeness or consideration of some kind, if ever? Or at what point do you get mean to it? In a world full of somewhat sentient or sapient devices which don't want or need ""rights"", it will say a lot about a person how they treat those things. Not for the sake of the device, but for the person's social reflexes.

>The difference between writing and chess is the fact that you think in words, not chess moves. That's why it's the only important barrier. Turing thought this all out, trust me. He offers rebuttals at the end of his paper for some of your claims.

Unless one is just typing randomly then there is logic, movement and order to writing. This is why we can describe computer programs using words, and also chess games for that matter. The comparative cognitive load between traditionally ""cerebral"" activities is probably an area that is prone to a lot of preconceived prejudices, so I hesitate to compare them. You can take a chat bot so far in a conversation sometimes because of how effective projection and cold reading are. To have a deep, cogent, considered, insightful, top notch conversation is so difficult that a lot of humans go through life without ever being more than very bad at it (I'm not great at it myself). When you consider how easy it is to misunderstand, fail to practice active listening, insert a preconception or prejudice, or otherwise mess up a conversation's context wildly between two human beings (and how these things are the norm rather than the exception for all but the most basic conversations between two people much of the time) I think we should consider that in some years most smartphones will be better conversationalists than most people. Even then, we will still probably be arguing about the Turing Test (only then it will be about how ""real people aren't that good at conversation"", in the same way that people accuse video game bots at times). I think it will be just another wake-up call for people who thought that the species was ""defined"" by a specific quality (in this case intelligent communication). Although not all of Turing's rebuttals have aged equally well, I'm not arguing with the paper. I also agree that this ""magic line"" of intelligence is over-rated or does not exist.

My retort to that is that of course, that's the only reason you're using the program -- because it could be built faster than we used to build software. And it's done faster now because we have the power of computationally inefficient tools like ES6 spreads and dynamic hashtables forming immutable datastructures, which make programming itself more efficient of a (human) process than something like dirty flags and mutable state/pubsub insanity.

I disagree on definitions for overengineering, optimization, engineering. IMO optimization and engineering are basically the same thing; you have a system of constraints, as well as a system of preferences, and are trying to produce a solution that solves all of the constraints while honoring the preferences as much as possible. You can engineer for certain things (our company has no money, it needs to be entirely libre software) or others (our company has infinite money, spend as much as possible to get it done quickly), just as you can optimize for either memory or speed. Over-engineering is a strange word because in e.g. bridge design it basically means ""to make something stronger."" To make something stronger in computer engineering is to make it simpler and easier to manipulate, which I feel is really not what people mean by ""overengineering.""

Typically when people complain that an Electron app is overengineered, they don't mean it in the traditional sense of the word, which would be to say it has too much functionality, too much capability.

I kind of agree with your definitions. Sort of.

Optimization is a loan word from the field of mathematics, which - loosely speaking - means to maximize or minimize a function given a set of constraints.

I'd rather describe engineering as the practice of designing a product while constantly assessing and choosing trade-offs between various considerations - quality metrics like application speed, size, features and correctness, but also ""softer"" considerations like development time, maintainability and customer requests. What you describe as optimizations I'd rather describe as trade-offs, because that's really what they are - what do we want and what is the cost? These trade-offs are what an engineer must make all the time and try to balance everything acceptably.

I fully agree that overengineering is an odd word. We generally agree that engineering is a good thing, so it's odd overengineering became a pejorative for a particular, disliked strategy of trade-offs.

Anyway, to get back to the central point of our conversation. I come from a system programmers perspective, and I too find it odd that web apps are criticized for algorithm efficiency. Web apps tend to use a lot of cycles, but I don't think the algorithms are the culprits here - I think the cycles may be eaten either in the abstraction layers or by the interpreter itself.

If we consider the classic meaning, where it means something is made unusually well (like a bridge meticulously constructed to be even better than with usual engineering), then the parallel meaning to software engineering could be that overengineering a piece of software to execute extraordinarily well (high speed, low memory usage, etc.). In other words, a highly optimized piece of software. Optimization makes the source code incredibly complicated, so overengineered software (classic meaning) is much more complicated than it probably needs to be.

rp1tzo,hq2vnqb,t3_rp1tzo,"I have an intuition why it is correct, but this intuition works by understanding the algorithm as an recursive algorithm.

Here's the set up: we want to rotate the array leftwards, such that the element that used to be at the `middle` position is now at the start (i.e. position `first`)

Note that if `middle=first`, we are done.

Otherwise, we will now swap the first k elements with the k elements starting at `middle`. k is at least one, and is determined by `min(middle-first, last-middle)`. For example, let's say we have an array with numbers 0..9, and we want to pull 3 to the front:`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` becomes `3 4 5 0 1 2 6 7 8 9` after this initial swap step. `k=3` as `3=min(3,7) = min(3-0,10-3) = min(middle-first, last-middle)`. `first` points at position `3` (i.e. `middle`), `next` points at `6`.

Another example: Same array, but `middle=7`:

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` becomes `7 8 9 3 4 5 6 0 1 2`, as `k=3` again, but this time it's because `last-middle=3`, which is the limiting term. `first` points at `3`, `next` at 10 (i.e. `last`)

Essentially, k is chosen such that at least one of the `if`s will become true after k iterations of the loop.

So, we have now done this step. Note that the first `k` elements are sorted, and `k>1`. Now, the magic is that the remaining array can be brought into correct shape by recursion.

In the first case, we have `0 1 2 6 7 8 9` remaining, which can be corrected by rotating such that the 6 is pulled to the front. In the other case, we must rotate `3 4 5 6 0 1 2` such that `0` is pulled to the front.

&#x200B;

The first case corresponds to `if (first==middle) middle=next;`, the last case to `if (next==last) next=middle;`. In the first case, our new `middle` will be `next` and we do recursion. In the latter case, `next` is reset to `middle`. Notice that in either case, the variables are now arranged as if we had done a recursive call, with `next==middle` holding.

As for run-time analysis, `first <= middle <= next <= last` always holds, and `first` continuously grows while `last` remains constant, thus we must eventually exit the loop, after at most `last-first` steps.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1640560492.0

rolb3t,hq0zltu,t3_rolb3t,"The r/math post has been removed, so I will copy and paste it here:

After watching a YouTube video on prime factorisations, I became interested in the patterns that appear when you factorise the natural numbers in order (from n = 2 onwards).

I think it's really interesting how these patterns appear. For example, when 2 is the base (which happens for every other n; as every other n is even, so has 2 as a factor), the powers follow this pattern:

1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5...

Edit: the powers really follow this pattern: 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 4... (I'd forgotten the case of 2\^0) and the pattern above is just for powers > 0, but the following logic still holds.

This pattern appears to be such that you have a '1' at every (1-based) index other than a multiple of 2 (so 1, 3, 5, 7, 9... and so on). But then if you remove all the '1's from this list, you end up with a new list: 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 5... Interestingly, this new list follows the same pattern, just now with '2's at every index other than a multiple of 2. This process carries on and on as you keep removing numbers.

What's even more interesting is that you see a similar pattern for higher bases. When 3 is the base (which happens every 3 n, again for the same reason as before), the powers follow this pattern:

1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4...

This pattern now appears to be such that you have a '1' at every index other than a multiple of 3 (so 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8... and so on). But again, if you remove all the '1's from this list, you end up with a new list: 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4... And again, this new list follows the same pattern, just now with '2's at every index other than a multiple of 3, and so on...

protocat-112ocat-112uestion is - what is going on here? Has anyone got an intuitive explanation for why these patterns appear?

To try and understand this a bit more (and since I am more computer scientist than mathematician) I looked up and found an algorithm for generating prime numbers. I then implemented it in C# (which I have called 'current algorithm'). I've added some comments with what I think is going on, but generally I understand it. The algorithm iteratively factors out every prime from the target number. Put this in a simple loop counting up from 2, and you can easily generate a table (or dictionary in this case) of all prime factors for n >= 2. What is the time complexity of this algorithm? I had a go at trying to figure it out and arrived at O(n\^3), but the while loop confused me somewhat...

What I wanted to do however was generate the prime factors in a different way. If I could figure out the pattern of the bases and powers, I could instead 'populate' each number with its factors looping though the factors (a base and a power) instead of the target number, starting with 2\^1, then 2\^2, 2\^3... then 3\^1, 3\^2, 3\^3... and so on. I came up with this algorithm (which I have called 'new algorithm'), which as pseudo code is as follows:

    dict = an empty dictionary with keys from 2 to SOME_LARGE_NUMBER
    FOR (base = 2 to base = SOME_LARGE_NUMBER):
      IF (dict[base] already has entries):
        // base is not prime
        SKIP to next base
      FOR (power = 1 to log_base(SOME_LARGE_NUMBER)):
        FOR (extender = 0 to base - 2):
          FOR (n = basepower + (extender * basepower) to SOME_LARGE_NUMBER),             
      INCREMENTING n by basepower + 1:
            dict[base].Add(base, power)

I managed to figure this out basically through trial and error. The core part of this algorithm is the final for loop. For base = 2, power = 1, extender is only 0 and this gives n = 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22.... For base = 3, power = 2, extender will be 0 then 1, giving n\_0 = 9, 36, 63... and n\_1 = 18, 45, 72 (which combined give us all the numbers which have 3\^2 as a factor). Again, my question here is why does this work? I am especially confused about my 'extender' code, which is, as I see it, a fudge to make it work. Also, what is the time complexity of my algorithm? I believe this runs in O(n\^3\*log(n)), but I may be wrong... I've only ever looked at the concept of time complexity for simple examples...

It's worth noting that the runtime of my algorithm seems to be much slower than the 'current' algorithm for finding prime factors when SOME\_LARGE\_NUMBER is indeed large (like 100,000). Also, I've not figured out how to optimise it for only looking for a single n, which I'm not even sure is possible, as the n is in the inner-most nested for loop, which is dependent on the outer loops.

However, it is considerably faster for a smaller value of SOME\_LARGE\_NUMBER, like 1000.

Both of these values may of course be affected by my specific implementation of the algorithms.

I'd be grateful if someone could explain or clarify any of the questions I've raised, or even just add any further info, discussion or relevant reading about this, as I'd love to understand more about what I am seeing.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,True,1640528679.0

rolb3t,hq1lqdj,t1_hq0zltu,"I responded to your /r/math post but I don’t think you understood my comment. Try seeing what happens for n=10 because its the one where people are most familiar with the divisibility rule for n^k.

Start from 0 and increment by 1 in steps. Every 10 steps it’ll look like xxxx0, which is a multiple of 10. Every 100 steps it’ll look like xxx00, which is a multiple of 10^2. Every 1000 steps it’ll look like xx000 which is a multiple of 10^3, and so on.

Now, transfer over this logic to n-nary numbers, since in base n, a number of the form xxx0^k has a n-adic valuation of k.

All of this exactly explains all your observations. Your operation of “removing all the 1’s” and seeing the same pattern with every number incremented by 1 is just you recursing on a new instance of your observation where everything is scaled by a factor n, i.e. increment in steps of n instead and chop off the least significant digit of your n-nary number

rne5t2,hprxku7,t3_rne5t2,"**Let's assume that 0 <= n <= 100. That is, n can take any value between 0 to 100 (inclusive).**

Under the above assumption, the worst case scenario is O(1) when n = 0 or when n = 1. This is because the number of times the recursive function will be called is a constant. The recursive function will be called 50 times and this is simplified to O(1).

Under the above assumption, the best case scenario is O(1) when n = 100 or when n = 99. This is easy to see as the recursive function is only executed once (again, a constant number of times) for when n = 100 or when n = 99.

**Let's assume that -inf < n <= 100. That is, n can take any negative number to 100 (including 100)**

Under the above assumption, the worst case scenario is O(n) when n = -100 or when n = -99. This is because the recursive function will be called 50 times to reach 0 from -100 or to reach 1 from -99. And then the recursive function will be called another 50 times to reach 100 from 0 or 99 from 1. I am presuming this is how your Prof came to the answer of O(n) under that assumption.

Under the above assumption, the best case scenario is O(1) when n = 99 or when n = 100. This is easy to see as the recursive function is only executed once (again, a constant number of times) for when n = 100 or when n = 99.

**Let's assume that n > 100. That is, n can take any number greater than 100.**

Under the above assumption, this is when the worst case is O(infinity) because the base case of the recursive function will never be met. The recursive function will be called infinite times. But for such questions, you usually don't consider the above assumption because there is no need/pointless for infinite calls of the recursive function. We want the recursive function to complete.

The initiative to take apart and repair a program is what separates a weak programmer from an intermediate one.

To defend my point, job interviews will occasionally ask you to debug or identify a program, and from that discussion, they can see how experienced you are with programming while also seeing what clever tricks you can come up with to simplify or refactor the code.

Though tbh having a nonterminating algorithm as an example for asymptotic analysis is just straight up stupid by OPs prof. 

Fundamentally asymptotic analysis is about how an algorithm behaves as the input size goes to infinity/how it scales with the input size. For example if you have an algorithm in O(n^2 ) then you don't know how quickly it will run for n = 1000 but you can estimate that the time it will take for n = 2000 will be roughly 4 times the time it takes for n = 1000.

>So, if we are not supposed to restrict n, then that just means the best and worst case is O(inf) as n approaches infinity right?

You can make a case distinction for n but that's not the same as bounding n. If you bound n then runtime will be O(1) for any terminating algorithm. However a case distinction without bounding n can give you some better insights.

Consider for example this contrived algorithm:

    f(n):
    if(n = 1): return 1
    else if(n is a power of 2): return 2 * f(n / 2)
    else if(n - 1 is a power of 2): return 2 * f(n - 2)
    else return 2 * f(n - 1)

The asymptotic complexity of this function is O(n). However we can make a restricted analysis and say that we only consider n = power of 2 as input. Then the asymptotic complexity of this function for this restriction is O(logn). However that is not the same as bounding n.

In order words, in your example, you do not need to fix n to a specific value to get the best case. However, in the above example you would have to do so, therefore these are not the same type of problem. In general asymptotics is all about rate of growth, so fixing n to any one value makes no sense, we care only about how the runtime of our function changes as n grows.

Also I do not understand your response to my last line. Let me give you an example of what I mean by ""If determining the best case was as simply as picking a value for n, every function would have a best case of Theta(1)."" Consider scanning through an array. How long does that take in the best case? Well theta(n) of course, because the best and the worse case of scanning through an array are no different. However, if you take your approach and allow yourself to fix values of n, you could just say the best case of scanning an array is Theta(1), because the size of the array could be 1.

I think this whole discussion boils down to the distinction between bounding and doing a case distinction.

OPs example is really not a good one for this distinction since there the necessary case distinction actually corresponds to bounding n. When I replied to your comment I was more talking about asymptotic analysis in general rather than OPs example.

A case distinction make bounds but in practice that is rarely useful. What I'm mainly referring to is case distinctions like these (considering an input n): n is a prime number; n is a power of 2; n is even or things like that. In all of these cases n is restricted but can still grow arbitrarily large. And n being able to grow arbitrarily large is the important thing since otherwise asymptotic analysis doesn't make much sense.

So bounding can be seen as a form of a case distinction, but that's rarely ever the kind of case distinction we want to make for asymptotic analysis (except for completely stupid examples like the algorithm OP posted).",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1640352748.0

Instead of looking for innovative ways to solve problems, they look for innovative ways to use blockchain. In lots of these cases, the problem could be solved much cheaper and simpler by using something other than a blockchain, like a distributed database. See [this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf) for some limitations (and some benefits) of blockchains.  

Blockchains aren’t even that great at solving the problem they were invented for: currency transfer. The bitcoin network can only handle around 7 transactions per second, while networks like Visa and Mastercard can process tens of thousands per second, all while using orders of magnitude less energy than bitcoin. 

And the energy use of cryptocurrencies can’t be overlooked either: the bitcoin network uses the energy of a mid-sized country, most of which comes from non-renewables. Lots of blockchain fans will say that this can be fixed with proof-of-stake or other consensus mechanisms, but this hasn’t really happened yet (and I’m skeptical that it ever will for major blockchains). Proof-of-stake is also a pretty bad consensus method if your goal is decentralization, as it just rewards the richest, accelerating inequality in your currency. 

Cryptocurrencies also offer little in the way of security compared to traditional banking/credit card systems. If someone steals my credit card and goes on a shopping spree, I can report it to my bank and they’ll close the card and issue charge backs. On the other hand, if someone steals my wallet key and transfers all my cryptocurrency to their account, absolutely nothing can be done to get the money back. It’s gone for good. There are far too many ways for key storage to go wrong for the average person to risk storing a significant amount of money in cryptocurrency.

1) Is it true that fixing the energy consumption problem with PoS hasn't really happened yet?

I know these chains have their own issues that may stem from the inherent downsides of PoS, but I did want to bring up that they are far more energy efficient than BYC and the current implementation of ETH. 

2) Addressing your point about PoS rewarding the richest. I have considered this and it makes sense on a theoretical level, but for example Cardano has introduced some interesting ways to push back on this (for example, the k parameter which caps the amount of interest a stake pool can earn, which incentivizes decentralization of staked ADA. Have you looked into this at all/have any thoughts? 

Finally, there is a cool game theoretic feature to PoS where in order to attack the network, you would need to control >50% of the networks tokens, but then you are just destroying value of an economy of which you control the majority of. This is in contrast to Bitcoin where the ""resource"" used to assure trust comes from outside the system and thus you don't need to own any Bitcoin to tank the network.

Blockchain uses “Proof of Work”, in which someone needs to do work just to prove that they’ve done it.  In particular, the way it works in blockchain is that multiple parties race to see who can complete the proof of work first.  So there ends up being an incentive (usually financial, as in cryptocurrencies) to do more work than others.

Work requires energy.  Not only is that a basic law of physics, but computational work specifically requires electricity.  The production and distribution of that electricity has environmental impacts, primarily (though not exclusively) in the form of carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change.

But is the amount of electricity consumed actually significant in the grand scheme of things?  Well, the bitcoin system itself uses about 121 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year.  That’s about the same as the entire country of Argentina, more than the Netherlands or UAE, and nearly as much as Norway.  For a sense of scale, researchers at Cambridge estimated that about 3-6 million distinct users used bitcoin in 2017.  Norway has a population of a bit over 5 million, so to a very rough approximation, each bitcoin user is consuming as much energy just to use bitcoin as each Norwegian is consuming for their entire lifestyle.  (Caveats:  The other countries are more populace, to varying degrees, so the same cannot be said for them.  Also, it is the bitcoin miners, not every user, who are consuming the energy, so I’m sort of amortizing that expense across all users.)  Or to look at it another way, the energy required to implement a single bitcoin transaction is enough to power an average U.S. household for 24 days.  (And that’s not to mine a whole bitcoin; that’s just for one transaction.)  Compared to an alternative financial system, you can perform 750,000 Visa card swipes for the energy of just one bitcoin transaction.  And all of this is only for bitcoin, not the sum total of all blockchain systems.  So yes, the energy consumption is very significant.

And all of this is fundamental to the concept of proof-of-work.  So it’s not just bitcoin, but all blockchain systems that use proof-of-work will have this problem.  And again, none of this is productive work; it’s just work for the sake of proving that you have done the work.

All of that is just the energy cost, though.  As people build large compute clusters and hardware accelerators (or just use graphics cards), etc., there is a lot of electronic hardware being produced only for the sake of performing this proof-of-work (e.g., mining bitcoins), and there is a significant environmental impact to mining all the minerals required to produce those electronic components.

rlfsh9,hpfibxk,t3_rlfsh9,"Structure alignment tries it's best to align structures to fall within certain boundaries. Specifically memory words. Most address schemes are aligned on word boundaries so if you don't align to them you have to have an (another) offset to find the start of a structure/ field, which takes more instructions and time. You also have caches to deal with, which always read in a certain amount of words, typically called a cache line with is typically measured in memory blocks. The same thing happens if you don't align fields in your structure to at least word boundaries. It can be very expensive if you go across cache line boundaries for a field, especially if one of your lookups results in a cache miss.

 Now like you said, a lot of structures are too big to fit in a cache line. But it still helps to align their fields to a word boundary because you still don't want to also have to figure out the offset within the word. This is why structs in c/c++ will pad fields typically to boundaries of the highest native type. It just makes book keeping easier/faster.

Us humans operate the same way. If you are counting by 4s it's much easier to count by 4 all the time than to count by 4 to a certain point then change to counting by ones.",9,0,0,0,9,False,False,False,1640098774.0

So reducing the number of times you have to go get data from somewhere else, the better.

If you are dealing with very large datasets, where you can’t fit all of the data into the cache, then knowing how data is read from memory/disk becomes more important. For example, execution times while looping over large 2D arrays will vary widely depending on which array is iterated in the outer loop, and which array is iterated in the inner loop.",6,0,0,0,6,False,False,False,1640104961.0
rlfsh9,hpghkr4,t3_rlfsh9,"I think you have missed something in your example.

If you have a struct with an 8byte field (e.g. a 64-bit integer) and a one byte field (e.g. an 8-bit integer) then on CPUs which have alignment restrictions the compile will add padding at the end of the struct so that when multiple structures are put in an array all fields can be accessed efficiently.

Usually the worst case for alignment restrictions is “natural” alignment which means in this case that the 8byte field must be 8byte aligned. The compiler would then create a struct with { 8 byte field, 1 byte field, 7 bytes of padding }. This ensures that the size of the struct is an even multiple of 8 so if you create an array of them the 8byte field alway lands on a even multiple of 8 byte offset from the start of the array.

Edit: adding explanation for why alignment makes things more efficient.

What is not obvious is WHY aligning fields makes things more efficient. Adding padding to structs “wastes” memory, so it actually makes things LESS cache efficient in general.

At a surface level the answer is that the actual binary CPU instructions have these alignment restrictions built in, so if the compiler wants to access a field it can do it with only a single instruction if it knows the field is aligned. If the compiler know the field is not aligned, then it must compile the unaligned access into multiple instructions that access smaller fields and then more instructions to combine these small access back together into a register with the whole value. Clearly one instruction vs multiple is more “efficient”.

Going deeper one may ask WHY would some CPU instruction sets have this kind of alignment restrictions? Not all CPUs have these restrictions, so why do some? The answer is that these restrictions make the HW simpler, and simpler HW takes less power/room leaving more left over for enhancing performance in general. For example on how aligned access make HW simpler: no access will cross a cache line or page boundary. This means that any aligned load/store maps to exactly one cache line and exactly one page and will never be split accross two of either. HW can be built with this simplification in mind.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1640113046.0

This makes no sense. None.

You've stated elsewhere here that...

> I'm mainly doing it this way so I dont have to use blobs in my database with byte type data and can just use varchar with hexadecimal. 

 This is a solved problem, bcrypt hashes are **strings** that have the form `$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy` and your hashes should be persisted in that format. If your implementation is producing binary output, you should use a different implementation. If you've implemented this yourself, **don't**. Use an off-the-shelf option. **Don't** run your binary data through MD5 just to get a hexadecimal representation. You'll produce something that is completely unportable, and you'll have no way to go back and *make* it portable as your original passwords will be lost after going through this Frankenstein hashing process. EVERY BCrypt implementation in any language can accept a hash in the form `$2a$...` and test it. Your hashes will be useless outside of your own narrow bit of code.

You've also said you're sending `md5(bcrypt(salt + password))` to the database. Where are you saving the salt?? You *need* that salt in order to compute `bcrypt(salt + candidate_password)` the next time the user attempts to log in. If you hash it with MD5, it's gone, and you can't use your stored hash for anything. Storing BCrypt in the form `$2a$...` takes care of this for you, storing the salt as part of the encoded hash.

Your question contains this troubling line:

> ... if they got the salt by hacking into the server ...

This implies to me that you're using **one salt** for all hashes, stored as a single secret. **That's not a salt, and this isn't BCrypt**. BCrypt uses a *per-user salt*, stored along side the output hash. Decorating your hash with a single application-wide secret is a [cryptographic **pepper**][1], which is not part of BCrypt and not useful. It's also unclear to me how you can be using a single pepper and still have BCrypt's cost factor at play.

Finally, MD5 is old and broken, and has **no business** being considered for use *anywhere*, but especially not in any thing related to security or password hashing. MD5 adds absolutely no security here, only complexity and harm, and it's about the worst possible way you could convert raw bytes to a hex encoding.

SHA-512 has been designed to be fast. You don't want any delays when validating a signature, for instance. There is no reason for generic cryptographic hashes to be slow.  
  
bcrypt on the other hand is a password hash that performs key strengthening on the input. Basically, it does this by slowing down the calculation so that attackers will have to spend more resources to find the input by brute-forcing or dictionary attacks. The idea is that although the legit users - you in this case - will also be slowed down, they are only slowed down once per password. However, the attackers are slowed down for each try. The legit user is of course much more likely to input the right password first.  
  
Furthermore, bcrypt also contains a salt as input, which can be used to avert rainbow table attacks.

It is a hypothesis because for determining relatively ""random"" events(although there are no random events in the known universe according to Laplace's demon) you would need a lot of computation and that often falls into the [Computability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory).

I wrote a paper about your question titled ""Can something be truly random"" but I later never published it. But I'll discuss some ideas about the paper here. So Laplace's demon is actually kinda proved by the fact that we can now calculate the result of a coin toss before the coin actually lands on the ground.

We can generate random numbers using nature and we can generate pseudo-random numbers using computers. Randomness of something completely depends on the patterns and predictability of the data. The predictability of data depends on the information conveyed by the data. Information is retrieved from the order of the data. If the data is redundant, meaning that it has no patterns but a pattern of uniformity, it conveys no information because it has no order. This relation can be stated as follows:
Randomness ∝ predictability ∝ information ∝ order ∝ regularity of data

We are not yet sure whether Laplace's demon holds in the world of quantum mechanics because ah things of the macroscopic world usually break in the microscopic world. 

Laplace’s theorem also collapses when we apply the second law of thermodynamics. According to Laplace’s theorem, nothing can be random and everything is predictable, which means that the information about the universe doesn’t increase because there is no randomness being created whatsover. This completely goes against the 2nd law of thermodynamics which states that the entropy of a physics system always increases with time.

Again this ain't true. This struct, on gcc x86, defies what you say:

    struct example { 
        char c;
        int i;
    } an_example;

    // Then print (&an_example + offsetof(an_example.i)) Vs (&an_example.c + sizeof(an_example.c))

This is due to padding. For GCC look up the ""packed attribute""

> am failing to understand that how do we access the consequent fields of a struct with just the memory address of the first field.

The compiler knows the size of each member of the struct, and therefore knows where each other field is. So everything you write `an_example.i` the compiler knows to translate that into a specific memory offset .  Look up the `offsetof` macro.

Yeah I was wrong there. The instance of a struct is rather a reference variable to the first field of the struct. Again this might be implementation specific(I am using Golang which is similar to C is a lot of aspects) but when I print the memory address of the struct instance and the memory address of the first field of the same struct instance, they both are the same.

Strings (and other advanced datatype) are not first-class types because they can be of arbitrary size. The string """" takes 1 byte, ""abcd"" takes 5 bytes and so on (don't forget the null byte).

* put in a pointer to the string, which then resides somewhere else in memory. Now your struct contains a pointer, with its specific size and alignment properties.

rj8mre,hp2gang,t1_hp2ahfx,"First let me provide some clarification on the first rule. It’s not exactly the n and n-1 relationship you described. Rather, I like to treat the beginning of the struct as a 0 point, and then ensure that each element begins at an “index” relative to the 0 point that is divisible by the size of the given element. For example, if we had a struct that had an 8 byte element, a 2 byte element, and a 4 byte element, it would look like this:

8 bytes | 2 bytes | 2 bytes of padding | 4 bytes

Note we have 2 bytes of inner padding, because our 4-byte element is now separated from our zero point by 12 bytes (without padding, it would be 10), which is divisible by 4. 

So now let’s revisit how we’re representing a string. Rather than storing the string literal, character by character, a string really just stores the address of a character array (where the array lives gets complicated and can vary, but it can be on the heap, in static initialized, static uninitialized, or perhaps even the stack), where the array represents the string. This way every string occupies 8 byes (since it is a char pointer). 

Knowing that, firstName and lastName are now both 8 byte addresses (char pointers)! Also, remember the age is a int and is 4 bytes, even tho the value is 33. So, here is our raw struct 

firstName | lastName |    age
8 bytes     | 8 bytes    | 4 bytes

Do we need any padding? The first element looks good, it’s just 8 byes. The second element is also 8 bytes, and the difference between the zero point is 8—all good. Our third element, age, seems to be good as well, it’s separated by 16 bytes from our zero point, which is divisive by 4. Now do we need any padding on the end? 

Total struct size = 8 + 8 + 4 = 20

20 is not divisible by 8! So we need 4 bytes of padding, to get our total struct size up to 24, which is divisible by 8. Here is our final struct:

firstName | lastName |    age    | padding
8 bytes     | 8 bytes    | 4 bytes | 4 bytes 

Total struct size = 24

Now, why does the second rule ensure we don’t have one element of a struct stretched across two blocks? Here is an example: lets say we have a struct that an 8 byte element and a 1 byte element:

|       8 bytes       | 1 byte

Now, lets say we want to make an array of structs. Each struct is 8 bytes in size, and arrays are stored contiguously in memory, so we have 

8+1 bytes | 8+1 bytes | 8+1 bytes | etc…


If our array is large enough we will eventually approach the end of a block. Will a block size ever be divisible by 9? Like, almost definitely not. So you’ll get the end of the block with less than 9 bytes of space left, and the struct will get chopped!",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1639848228.0

First, you should identify what the ""problem size"" is in this context. It looks like the input of your algorithm consists of a list of lists. Candidates for the problem size here could be:

* The total number of items.
* The number of lists in the `lists` object.
* Both of the above.

The first option is probably the most applicable here, so let's say `n = total number of items`.
For your sample input, `n = 6`.

To find the worst case runtime of this algorithm to be Θ(f(n)), you want to show that a worst case instance of the algorithm will:

* complete in **at most** `constant * f(n)` steps (which shows the algorithm runs in O(f(n)) time), *and*
* requires **at least** `constant * f(n)` steps to complete (which shows the algorithm runs in Ω(f(n)) time).

The `constant`s in the above two conditions need not be the same constant, but they must both be independent of `n`.

So first, you should consider what is a worst case instance for your algorithm. Hint: you've already given a worst case instance for `n = 6`. Then you should prove the two statements for some function `f`.

Photos and videos can hardly be compressed further using lossless, general-purpose compression. That's because most common image and video formats already employ compression, often both [lossy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression) and [lossless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression) compression, and applying compression on top of compression generally doesn't give you much. There might be some slack to be picked up by state-of-the-art lossless compression but not a lot. I'd expect almost no gain from compressing already compressed image or video files.

Word documents and other documents from the modern Office suite are also already compressed, and while the compression used in the file format may not be bleeding-edge and you can probably compress it a little more with a better compression algorithm, it's probably not going to be that much.

Most video games that can take a lot of space also come with the majority of their assets compressed nowadays.

Plain text compresses fairly well, but few people have plain text files taking a lot of disk space. Uncompressed image files may also compress well, depending on the image, but few image formats that are commonly used today are uncompressed.

> If the data is redundant, meaning that it has no patterns but a pattern of uniformity, it conveys no information because it has no order. This relation can be stated as follows:

^ An extract from a paper I wrote about randomness but never published it.

If you had photos with all the pixels of same values. You could compress it to about `1/resolution + bits required to store the length of resolution` size.

Compression is just representing a relatively large amount of data in a concise form. For example `11111111` will be compressed as ""1 for 0100 bits"". If it is a random(explaining what is random, would make the comment humongous so leave it out) pattern, you cannot compress it because you cannot express something random in some other form because you do not know anything about its pattern.

So, now answering all your questions one by one:

Not much really because the compression algorithms which are the norms haven't changed much since 2000s, we still use JPEG widely which was originally developed in the late 1980s. We are still using H264 which was originally developed in 2003. H265 was developed in 2013. So compression hasn't changed much in the last 10-20 years.

You can compress an image without loss of data to about 10% with JPEG encoding, but again this is based on the randomness of the pixel values.

> If one terabyte holds 1,000,000,000,000 bytes, what is the utmost limit of compression?

The utmost limit of compression will depend on the data in that 1 TB of data as explained earlier in the comment.

Well, its in your hands whether data loss will occur or not. You can compress an image to like 50% its size with loss of data but usually the loss of data is not traded for high compressibility.

rihkz0,hoxgzd8,t3_rihkz0,"Before you dive into software architecture, I'd recommend working on becoming a great software developer first. The book gets a lot of slack, but for young developers I still recommend Clean Code by Bob Martin. Once you've completed (or better yet, while!) some introductory background reading, start implementing the principles discussed in a language you're comfortable with. Small, simple examples with easy to understand conventions will go a long way. Next, take those principles and use them in an existing architecture - MVC is a great one for Java.

From there, it's good to start working on how you organize your software. For this I like to recommend A Philosophy of Software Design (2018) by John Ousterhout for a supplemental approach to the ""historical knowledge"" as well as studying design patterns. [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) provides a great overview of some of the most common design patterns you'll see in software through an application that's very approachable through most - game design. Design patterns are great to know because if you can employ and identify them properly, it will be easier for others to understand what your code is doing and vice versa. This is also the point where you start incorporating those principles you learned above into larger projects. 

Finally, to answer your exact question of ""how to understand large and scalable projects,"" [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) is what you're looking for. Practice taking a problem, designing a solution for it, and comparing against what the author implemented. But work on the above first.

If you are using a common messenger, you typically press enter to send the message, and if you want a new line you have to press shift+enter. In a email, you can just press enter to get a new line and have to klick on a button to send the email.

This tells us, that a messenger captures the enter key and uses it as a ""command"" to send the text, while the email programm captures the enter key and uses it to append a new line to the text.

So the same key can do different things on different programms. This is because the programm, and not the keyboard, decides what to do with the pressed key. Because of this you also can easily switch between different keyboard layouts without replacing the keyboard.

rhll1c,host0b2,t1_hore9kn,"> So, the character H and the Character 7 would equal the same amount of bytes? Which is one or two depending on the encoding?

Some encodings are fixed-length, i.e. all characters are encoded with the same number of bits. This is how many common 8-bit text encodings worked in the past: every character was exactly 8 bits. That also set an obvious limit on the maximum number of unique characters that could be represented, as there are 2^8 = 256 unique combinations of 8 bits that are possible.

Other encodings are variable-length, and a single character can take one or more bytes to represent. The most common text encoding on the web is UTF-8 where every character takes between 1 and 4 bytes. The most common characters in English text (the ones that are included in ASCII, which is an old character encoding standard) take up 8 bits, or one byte. This would include the English alphabet, digits 0 to 9, and a number of other characters, but not many non-English letters. This allows the encoding to be compatible with the old ASCII standard. There are more than a million other characters that are possible in UTF-8, but they can take up two to four bytes per character.

So, even when using a variable-length encoding, H and 7 are still likely to take up the same number of bytes, but H, ü and 国 can take up different numbers of bytes.

I don't know about the text encoding used in SMS specifically, but as u/CarlGustav2 said, it seems like there are two possible encodings, one of which is a fixed-length 7-bit encoding, with the other one being a fixed-length 16-bit one.

Yes, if it's using a fixed-length 8-bit (or 7-bit) encoding. A 7-bit encoding would allow basic English text but no international characters; an 8-bit encoding such as [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) would allow some non-English characters but the set of characters would depend on the encoding, as no 8-bit encoding can have enough unique combinations of 8 bits to represent letters used in all languages. (Some languages such as Chinese or Japanese of course have thousands of characters all by themselves, so they wouldn't fit in *any* 8-bit encoding even on their own.)

If you want to know whether an email message consisting of 100 written characters can actually fit in 100 bytes, it's worth noting that email messages also include various control information in so-called headers, including the sender and recipient, the text encoding used, and various other things, so a full email message is actually going to take up more space than that.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1639674660.0

Now this is clearly enough to represent the English language. The most common 1-byte encoding is usually ASCII. Just Google ""ASCII table"" to see the encoding. On the other hand, what if you want to represent almost all languages? You will need more bits to make that work. If you instead use a two byte encoding then you can represent 2^16 = 65,536 characters. Now this is enough to represent pretty much all characters you'll need globally. 

So essentially, if the application you're using allows characters other than English then it's probably using 2-byte encoding. Single byte encoding was mostly used back before the whole world had internet and every language needed to be encoded. 

For your last question, yes, enter is going to be a newline character (or possibly two characters if you're on windows). To you when you click enter it looks like nothing there, but realize that the reason your cursor moves to the next line is because the text editor is showing you the message being typed, and the only way anything changes on the screen is if a new character is entered.

In this scenario, I’ll say both contain 36 bytes. If that’s true and the transmission signal adds a certain length of extra data, how great would the difference be? If you know the question, that’d help a lot. 

Also, people are saying you can change the encoding for an email. How would I go about choosing an encoding that is strictly one byte per character? Or is that already the preset encoding software? As for the email, let’s say I’m using the google email or hotmail. 

Space counts as a character? I see. That makes sense. Does a space contain one byte like every other character? Or since it is blank, is it lowered to lesser bits? 

Enter doesn’t count count as a byte? How about as data? Since it’s caught by the program and then sent out, surely it contains wavelength data of a sort. Any idea of the specific amount?

If you create a new line, does the combination of shift+enter equal two bytes if you are utilizing a encoding that equals 8 bits per character. Thus one byte a character. For practical reasons, let’s say that there was only one space skipped on the last line, meaning, it would be 3 bytes now. Right? Or does skipping a line not take enter+shift as a double character command? Merely just a single command since it is utilizing a single command to create a single character. If you know what I mean.

It is not possible to write a message in Chinese that uses one byte per character (assuming an 8-bit byte). This is because one bye can represent 256 Disney numbers. So you can encodes the English alphabet by saying A=65, B=66, C=67 and so on. Then a=97, b=98, c=99 and so on. But there are more than 256 Chinese characters and so it will necessarily take more than one bye per character to encode a message in Chinese.

There are two characters related to new lines in common encodings, called Line Feed and Carriage Return (LF and CR).  These names come from mechanical printers which had to be told separately to move the paper up a line (LF) and to move the print head back to the start of the line (CR).  There are several conventions on how these characters are used to construct new lines in different bits of software. Some use only a CR at the end of each line.  Some use only a LF.  Some use both CR+LF.  CR and LF are both part of the ASCII character set and have values 10 and 13.

Every character in the ASCII art takes the same number of bits to represent.

Note that some older email clients used 7-bit ASCII to represent emails. Since you can represent 32 non-printing characters, upper and lowercase letters, numbers and a selection of punctuation in 128 characters, you only need 7 bits to assign a unique number to reach character.

For eg: PROM is a programmable ROM that can only be programmed once, while EPROM is Erasable PROM, so shine a UV light and the data disappears.

rhhyf3,hos7qu5,t3_rhhyf3,"Transferring or processing data doesn't cause any meaningful wear. Writing the data on a storage device may cause wear but usually not enough to matter in most cases.

Electronics, such as the wires or the computer's CPU or RAM memory, don't really suffer physical wear from processing data. Heavy use of components such as the CPU can cause the component to heat up, and repeated heating and cooling cycles may technically shorten the lifespan of the component. However, that would typically only really make a difference on a time span of decades. That's much longer than you're going to be using a CPU or any other computer component in any everyday use.

Downloading files also doesn't really cause heavy load on the CPU or other components in a computer, so downloading data probably wouldn't make even that kind of a difference.

As for storage devices, that depends on the technology used in the storage drive. SSDs do have a limit on the number of times each memory cell can be written to, so frequently writing a lot of new data on an SSD does theoretically shorten its lifespan. How much data you have on an SSD doesn't matter; what matters is how many gigabytes of new data you keep writing.

However, you can typically overwrite each cell on an SSD thousands of times. As long as there's free memory space available, the SSD also automatically tries to spread the data writes evenly over the free physical flash memory so that the wear wouldn't all be on the same cells even if you keep overwriting the same files. You probably can't wear out a modern SSD with any kind of normal use even if you download or otherwise write lots of large files on it. SSD wear might matter in heavy constant use, such as perhaps in a data center, but it doesn't really matter in desktop use.

Mechanical hard drives are a little different. They are, well, mechanical, and they suffer physical wear over time. A hard disk drive has spinning disks that rotate at thousands of RPM, and data are stored by altering magnetic fields on the disk. Mechanical parts such as bearings can wear out over time. However, most of the wear would probably come simply from having the hard disk drive powered on and the disks spinning, or from powering the drive on and off often, rather than from writing lots of data on it.

The syntax is dead simple, arguably moreso than Ocaml, and because it's run using an interpreter, it's very easy to see the results of your code quickly. It's also typeless, which means there's one dimension fewer to wrap your head around.

Fact 1: After even number of moves monkey will be on same parity (odd/even) as it started, after odd number of moves it will be on different parity.

  
Start at door 2, go up 1 door at a time (2, 3, 4,...)  


Fact 2, starting from the left and working your way up one door at a time, if monkey starts on same parity door you start on monkey will be caught at worst when you get to n - 1 door where n is the number of doors.

  
Proof by induction

  
base case 3 doors n = 3

  
proof by exhaustion

If you start on door 2 monkey must be on 2, you open door 2 and catch him

  
If you start at 1 monkey must be on 1 or 3. If on 1 you will catch on first check. After first check monkey must move to 2. So on second check you will catch it. 3 - 1 = 2

  
case k + 1 (4 doors) n = 4  
proof by exhaustion

If you start at door 1 monkey and monkey starts on door 1 you will catch it on first check.

If you start on door 1 and monkey starts on door 3 you miss first check, if it moves to door 2 you will catch on second check as shown in base case. If monkey moves to door 4 on second move you will miss on checking door 2. But on 3rd move it must move to door 3, you will check door 3 and catch it.

If you start on 2 and monkey starts on 2 you will catch it on first check.

If you start on 2 and monkey starts on 4 you will miss first check, it must move to 3 and you will catch on second check.

  
By induction if monkey starts on same parity as you you'll catch it at worst on the n - 1 door. Fact 2 is true.

  
So starting on door two and working your way up, if you get to the n - 1 door (in our case 9) and there is no monkey, you know that the monkey couldn't have started on an even # door or else we would have caught it according to Fact 2. So this means the monkey started on an odd number door. After checking doors 2-9 (8 moves) the monkey must currently be on an odd numbered door according to Fact 1.  
We know the monkey must be on an odd door, so using symmetry we know if we start on an odd door (9 in this case) and go back down in same manner (9, 8, 7,...) and we know that we will catch the monkey at worst at door 2. So for 10 doors 2345678998765432 will at worst catch monkey on the last door. Just drop the last 2 off your solution.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1639241909.0

rdlhtp,ho5f20s,t3_rdlhtp,"The solution depends on the number of cages. I'm using 0 indexing.

The idea is as follows. Guess 0..1...2....n-1. If the monkey was initially on an even index, we will always win in this first iteration. This holds for the general case where - if the monkey is on our right, and we guess an even index while the monkey is on an even index, we will always find it by linearly scanning.

So our goal now is to somehow ensure this happens.

With an even number of cages, if we guess 0...1...2...n-1, and we don't find the monkey, then it must have started on an odd indexed cage. After an even number of guesses, the monkey will be on some random even indexed cage, so if we guessed cage 0 twice ( to force the monkey to go odd -> even ). After that second guess, we've now guessed an even cage whilst the monkey was on an even index, so we know we will win.

Similarly, with an odd number of cages, we can do a linear scan once, but we only guess cage 0 once as well, as after an odd number off guesses, our orginally-odd-monkey would be on an odd cage, so if we guess 0 after n-1, we will once again gaurentee that we guess an even index while the monkey is on an even index as well.

This problem fucked me up because I initially thought there was a way to solve it with (a natural) recurrance.

You already explained in a comment that if the monkeys starts in an even numbered cage, we will catch him in the first ""half of the run"". I cannot proof this assumption but it seems to be true. I tested this with numbers up to n=6 and I could not find a counter example. I know this is not a proof, but I firmly believe this assumption is true.
Following this assumption, this means the second half of the run is only entered, If the monkey starts at an odd numbered cage. The two times we open cage at position (n-1) imply, that beginning from the second half of the run, every time we open an even numbered cage, the monkey is in an even numbered cage. Same goes for odd positions during the second ""half"", if we open an odd numbered cage, the monkey is in an odd numbered cage. So the monkey is not able to cross us.
Thus the opening of cage 2 two times in the end is unnecessary, opening cage 2 one time in the end is enough: if we open cage 3 during the second half, the monkey is in cage 1. Monkey then has to move to cage 2, and we open cage 2 afterwards.

So all in all, the 234...(n-1)(n-1)...432 approach gives us 2*(n-2) cages to be opened at maximum, which would be 16 for n=10. Please correct me, if I did a mistake anywhere!",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1639224667.0

If the monkeys starts in an odd numbered cage, the doubled 9 in the middle will make it so that you will open an odd numbered cage at the same time as the monkey will be in one.

Wait what? The next move from OPs example was to open cage 8. No monkey in cage 8, so close the door. Monkey moves from 7 to 8. OP then continues moving down to 7 and so on, missing the monkey.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. I meant it moved into an odd cage after we opened 9 for the first time, so at the moment we are opening 9 again, it is already in an odd cage.

Step by step from this point:

* Monkey can be in 2, 4, 6, or 8
* We open 9, monkey moves to 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9
* We open 9 again, monkey is not there (so he is in 1, 3, 5, or 7), he can move to 2, 4, 6, or 8
* We open 8, monkey is not there (so he is in 2, 4, 6), he can move to 1, 3, 5 or 7
* ...
* We open 3, he is not there, so we know he is in 1 and has to move to 2, so we open 2 and find him",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1639243048.0

FORTRAN is a very simple language. It's in fact the first compiled ""high level"" computer language.

The one I understand that causes the most problems is aliasing. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing\_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing))

If the same memory location can be represented by multiple variables, then the compiler has to assume worst case and cannot optimize certain paths. If the language doesn't allow such flexibility, then the compiler can crack its knuckles and go to town on optimization.

Compare that to:

`sideOneLength^2 + sideTwoLength^2 = hypotenuseLength^2` 

But now imagine for much more complicated statements or entire proofs written out like this. 

In proofs, compactness is a virtue that helps with readability and understandability. There's a reason separate mathematical language was invented and we don't write formulas out like

Same thing for crypto currencies, where value is placed on an association with your wallet and the sum of all your transactions.

Seems arbitrary, but the same thing goes for money - if nobody would believe it has value, it would not have it.

My opinion is still sceptical. Crypto currencies praise themselves as decentralized - which may be true as long as you stay in an ecosystem where all goods and services may be paid for with such a currency - but when you want to exchange them for ""real"" money you need to go to a centralized exchange, where you can be identified and privacy flies out of the window as well.

At the moment they’re being used for digital beanie babies, and it’s hard to see true value there

But looking at real world potential: I’ve just spent £1000 on solicitors fees to check the title deeds and other information about the house I’m buying, and most of that cost is retrieving the information they need. A tokenized system could be ideal for something like that. Whether that takes the same exact form as an NFT, I don’t know, but the idea was floated long before NFTs existed

Similarly car ownership, maintenance and inspection records etc would seem like great candidates for a token system - allowing authorized dealers and garages to log information on a decentralized blockchain, which could be much more reliable and cheaper to run than a centralised system.

I wouldn’t say they’re definitely suitable for such tasks, but certainly there’s real world potential there

Perhaps more importantly, digital ownership of songs, movies, books etc would be a perfect candidate. Streaming is great but not ideal because you can’t buy something to keep. But buying digital assets relies on the store/service you use staying in business

NFTs could solve this by allowing you to own a song more generically, so record labels or publishers can reassign the rights to sell those items to another distributor/store/service, on the proviso that they are sold as NFTs and the new provider will supply a download to the owner of the token.

This is entirely different from stocks, which are, by definition, an investment. There are valid reasons to use crypto as a currency, too, namely the very reasons it was created for: decentralization, anonymity, universality, etc. In fact, it was used for those ends before it was an investment. However, these are things that the average person doesn’t care about, and “making an investment out of them to begin with” doesn’t change that. Stocks have been around forever now, and they’re still not used as currency (you don’t buy things in the market with stock, or pay for services, etc.) because, again, they’re fundamentally an investment, and not a currency, as opposed to cryptocurrencies. 

I’d go so far as saying that crypto as an investment is inherently a bubble based on hype and misinformation. Stocks are associated with the worth of a company, so, in theory, it makes some sense that the price changes with time, as the company’s value also varies according to how well it performs. Crypto, on the other hand, is entirely based on: will people adopt this currency? However, as long as people face it as an investment, they won’t be using it as currency (because it lacks the stability that a currency needs, after all, if you can’t be sure of its worth tomorrow, you probably won’t want to stake your livelihood on it, which is why people won’t be inclined to take it directly in exchange for goods and services on the mainstream, which is even more reason for it’s instability since it exists only tethered to some other currency, i.e.: it doesn’t have “independent” value, it’s worth only however many dollars people are willing to pay for it at the moment)

In case you don't have a CS background, it means formally proving that an algorithm, if followed exactly, will logically and inevitably reach the correct answer. It's similar to a proof in mathematics.

If you do have a CS background -- as you probably do considering the understanding you show -- you knew that already, so I'm not sure what the point of the question is.

> If we build a super artificial intelligence that solves certain problems but the proof is so complex that no human could ever understand it, then does that mean it hasn't been proved?

Okay, so I'm assuming we're talking about an ANN producing a proof about something rather than just producing yes-no answers to the question of whether a program will halt.

Can you directly prove that the proof (supposedly produced by the AI itself) is valid? Or that the proof has been generated using a method that's formally proven to only produce valid proofs? If the answer to either of those is yes, then I would generally consider it proven even if we can't directly understand the proof itself, if the methods used for either producing or checking the proof were formally proven to be correct. That is, of course, with the usual caveat that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and that we should carefully check the validity of whatever logic was used for supposedly vouching for the validity of the proof.

However, it's worth noting that artificial neural networks don't generally work in such a way that you could formally prove anything about the validity of their results. They just empirically seem to work for a bunch of problems. So, if we're dealing with an ANN, we can't prove that the method (the ANN itself) with which the supposed proof was found was guaranteed to only produce valid proofs, and so the proof that it produces would need to be validated in some other way. That could be either by humans understanding the proof and meticulously checking it for errors, or using automated theorem proving. (Automated theorem proving is then again an undecidable problem in the general case, although it's decidable for some subset of possible inputs, so YMMV.)

However, the point is kind of moot if we're talking about perfectly solving the halting problem. It has been proven to be undecidable in the general case, at least in the sense that for a hypothetical algorithm that purports to solve it, it's always possible to construct an input for which it fails.

You might be able to have a neural network that produces what empirically seem to be correct answers to various instances of the halting problem, with or without any formal proof of anything. You might be able to have a neural network produce a formal and provable theorem about *which* kinds of special cases of the halting problem are decidable. But you wouldn't be able to have a neural network that provably (in the formal sense) correctly answers the halting problem for any and all instances of it.


> This is the crux here. I think the question is theoretically could a maximally intelligent God solve the halting problem? And i don't mean a maximally intelligent God could create a proof solving the traditional halting problem, but rather give any code to that maximally intelligent being and it could determine whether the code halts or not.

That's kind of getting into metaphysics. I don't think there will be a valid answer to such a question, any more than to any other question regarding what results from omnipotence.

> It seems like a very different type of question whether intelligence can solve a problem compared to a direct computational approach. The way I think about it is humans create solutions and proofs in math, using intelligence, that would never be achieved with standard computation. They seem like different problem domains.

That's a valid question to think about. Humans, and actual intelligence (whatever that means), do usually arrive at solutions in a different way than direct computation.

I don't think that necessarily helps a hypothetical AI formally solve the halting problem, although I guess I kind of see where you're coming from. Yes-no answers to the halting problem could hypothetically be accompanied by a proof or reasoning of why a program always halts or why it doesn't, and an intelligence that doesn't (superficially speaking) work by means of classical mechanical computation might be able to creatively come up with answers and proofs that a classical algorithm wouldn't.

The problem is that, if whatever produces those answers and proofs *doesn't* do it systematically, e.g. by enumerating all possible proofs, you can't really prove that it will always be able to find one for *all* instances, even if the answers could be shown to be correct about the ones for which it does. The same is of course true of humans.

Of course, but I don't think that's the same thing. *Someone* has been able to present those proofs, and they've been independently reviewed by others with the required expertise.

If you're committed to something electronic, I would look at solid state storage, something older (and thus likely more robust), like mask ROMs.  Even consumer grade mask ROMs last decades with very little care (think Atari 2600 cartridges, some are from the 1970s, most of them still work if they're clean).  You could probably take inspiration from Viking and Voyager space probe computers, the Voyagers are still functioning after decades.  A nation-state actor could surely take lessons learned and make a very robust system in a similar manner.  Voyager used dual redundant systems and CMOS volatile memory with a direct, permanent connection to the RTG.  You'll also probably want some kind of nuclear-derived power.

My main thought is things need to be designed to be fault tolerant and redundant, the system should have the ability to bypass or work around failed parts, and the storage area should be as clean, even temperatured, and dust/moisture-free as possible, say, in a cement-lined cave.  A big part of why electronics fail is due to temp cycles.  Moisture in the air combining with contaminated on the hardware can cause corrosion.  Avoid the use of electrolytic capacitors.

rbwnot,hnwdlhm,t1_hnwbn4y,"Well, at my high school, it was easy to make this program. For their school logins, everyone had a username that could be easily determined. It included their name and graduation year (Ex: John doe graduates in 2022: jdoe22). For the password, it was always the word ""pass"" and then a 4 digit number (Ex: pass9233). My program first asked the user to type in the student's full name and graduation year. After that, it generated the username automatically and stored it in a variable (very simple code). Then, it opens up a tab in Chrome, goes to our school portal website, and starts entering the username and every possible combination of the password until it works. pass0001, pass0002, pass0003 and so on. In reality, I had it open 4 different Chrome tabs at once to do it faster, but it worked on every single student. Does your school have a password system like that?

The term ""core dump"" likely originated in the 1960s when early computers used magnetic core memory. When a running program crashed, all of the data in the entire core was printed out on paper to help with debugging.

Core dumps are generated when the process receives certain signals, such as SIGSEGV, which the kernel sends when it accesses memory outside its addressed space.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1642445213.0

 >In computing, a core dump, memory dump, crash dump, system dump, or ABEND dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally. In practice, other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time, including the processor registers, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information. A snapshot  dump (or snap dump) is a memory dump requested by the computer operator or by the running program, after which the program is able to continue.

r95hk3,ht2lguo,t3_r95hk3,"Simple answer: No.

A computer cannot even draw a mathematical point (which has no dimensions whatsoever)—in fact one cannot exist in any real sense. A mathematical circle has no height and no width.

No perfect mathematical shapes exist in nature, although some shapes come very close. Even when a physical law applied to a certain situation predicts a perfect mathematical shape, there are always extra factors that are not considered by the physical law that mess things up: friction, air resistance, relativistic corrections, quantum uncertainty, atomic granularity.

An example of something very close to a perfect circle in nature is the orbit of Venus about the Sun. This near perfection is attained because:

1. The initial velocity of Venus was such that its orbit is nearly circular and not as elliptical
2. There is very little air resistance or friction in space
3. The Sun is so distant from Venus and so round that it acts almost exactly as a point source of gravity
4. Venus is so big that quantum effects are very small
5. Sun's gravity is weak enough that Newton's law of gravitation is reasonably accurate

But, all of these statements are not perfect, so there are still many small sources of deviation from a perfect circle, even for Venus' orbit.

Consider trying to draw a perfect circle on paper with graphite. Even if you were able to use an AFM tip, laser sensors and a feedback loop to perfectly space every single carbon atom to form the circle, you still have the fact that the circle is made out of atoms. Zoom in enough on the circle and it's not smooth anymore because of the profile of the atoms.

Then let's say the next instruction is an ""add accumulator with value"" instruction, and that causes the processor to enter a state where it next reads a raw value, and finally performs a binary addition operation (also implemented using logic gates) with the read value and the value in the accumulator, storing the result in the accumulator.

r8upnl,hn915z3,t3_r8upnl," To understand the classical computer, it's useful to sort of build up to it in complexity. We started with electrical circuits where humans could manually open and close circuits via switches. A switch allows a circuit to store a single bit of information which says either ""the circuit is closed"" or the circuit is open. But what if, instead of a human having to flip a switch, we could create a switch that would open or close a different circuit based on whether or not its own circuit is open or closed. Such as switch is known as a transistor, and through the triumph of the transistor we can go beyond simple circuits and arrive at machines which can perform arbitrary computation by opening and closing circuits in complex patterns.

So however a punch card reader worked physically, it ends up in opening and closing a circuit in a pattern that can then be stored in the open and closed states of the computers internal circuits. Then the computer can use this stored set of open and closed circuits as a starting point and by opening and closing circuits in it's particular pattern( as specified by its instruction set), the computer can execute the stored program. (This might be a slight oversimplification, because real computers might rely on more complex physics for some sorts of memory, but all the logic in a computer could be implemented with circuits in theory)

NVRAM is typically used for performance or simplicity of design where the content needs to be changed rapidly.  Dynamic RAM (ie VRAM) often must be refreshed for the content to be retained.  Flash memory can be rapidly read and slowly written. Many flash memory devices also have limits on the number of times they can be written. Generally EEPROM has a much higher limit on the number of writes so they are often used to store data that needs to be preserved over a system restart ( power cycle ) such as a position of a gate or valve overnight.  So the types of memory for a computer system is selected based on targeted application function:  
     Dynamic RAM — Typically large memory so refresh cost is minimized; low cost; good to excellent performance; 
                                  ok to lose content I f reset/power loss.
     NVRAM — higher cost, simple design, Excellent performance.  Typically content preserved over reset/power

About what you said in your rant; you certainly could compare run times of Algorithms directly.  But doing so introduces many factors not really part of the algorithm itself. Like for example the speed of the computer running the algorithm.
With asymptotic growth, we're really interested in the algorithm on an abstract level, away from all implementation.

This is also part of why we say things like ""O(3n+log(n) + 2n^2) = O(n^2)"". All the constant disappear because they don't really matter for our purpose; if the algorithm runs in O(2n^2), one can insert a processor of double the speed to combat it. But one cannot ""fight"" against asymptotic growth; no matter the speed of your computer, O(n^2) becomes arbitrarily large and at a speed where any smallere term like O(7n) becomes completely negligible if we increase n far enough.

> Like if you already have a function that perfectly describes your algorithms time complexity, what's the point in simplifying it in a weird way

One of the problems is that you *don't* necessarily know the exact function, at least not with precision that would make those exact details meaningful. What would you base the exact complexity function on? Which programming language is it written in? The same algorithm that works based on the exact same idea will have its exact details, and the exact number of steps, look different in different programming languages. Or, more importantly in terms of performance, if it's compiled into machine code, which processor is that? If it's interpreted, which interpreter? The machine code is going to be different for an ARM processor than for an x86-64 one, and the number of machine instructions is going to be different. Some CPU instruction sets might provide individual instructions that do more work in a single instruction but could take longer to execute. Moreover, different instructions take a different number of cycles on different CPU models even if the instruction set is the same.

Asymptotic complexity doesn't change from a language to another, or from a CPU instruction set or a physical processor to another. It's a mathematical property of the algorithm itself. A quadratic function is always going to be quadratic regardless of the constant multipliers; a linear one is going to be linear; an exponential one is going to be exponential. That way you can talk about the algorithm itself more generally rather than its implementation in a particular language, or on a particular CPU.

Including every constant and every term when talking about an algorithm more generally would often mean giving more detail than you perhaps have grounds for. It would be a bit like reporting seven digits in your calculated result about a physical phenomenon when the original measurements are only really accurate enough to warrant two. It kind of looks more accurate but most of it is just noise.

You could argue for keeping the lower-degree terms even if the constants were discarded, of course. It might sometimes make sense to think of an algorithm's time complexity as being in the order of N^2 + N if that happens to be true rather than just N^2. And that wouldn't (probably, at least not always) even depend on the implementation, and could be part of the behaviour of the algorithm itself.

The highest-degree term starts to dominate as N grows indefinitely, which is what asymptotic analysis deals with, so the lower-degree terms are skipped. But you could reasonably argue that the lower-degree terms are part of the algorithm's behaviour, too.

> that breaks algebra rules?

This is a bit of an aside, but I don't think it really actually breaks algebra rules. The common way the notation is used perhaps does.

What for example O( n^2 ) actually denotes is the set of functions that are bounded above by n^2 * c for some constant c. The pedantically correct way would be to say that an algorithm's worst case complexity is *in* O( n^2 ), for example, rather than that it equals O( n^2 ). That's one of the things that people very often write in a way that's rigorously speaking not quite right.

It did, traditionally. And a lot of Computer Science courses will teach this stuff. But these days it's considered Computer Engineering, but there's a huge cross over between the two, as CE can be seen as a subfield of CS, or a cross over of CS and Electrical Engineering.

Check out /r/ComputerEngineering for more.

Anyway, here's my stock answer for this question:

If you want to learn about computer architecture, computer engineering, or digital logic, then:

1. Read [**Code** by **Charles Petzold**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319).
2. Watch [Sebastian Lague's How Computers Work playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq)
2. Watch [Crash Course: CS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) (from 1 - 10) 
3. Watch Ben Eater's [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypETld5oX1ZMI-LYoA2LWi8D) about transistors or [building a cpu from discrete TTL chips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). (Infact just watch every one of Ben's videos on his channel, from oldest to newest. You'll learn a lot about computers and networking at the physical level)
3. If you have the time and energy, do https://www.nand2tetris.org/

There's a lot of overlap in those resources, but they get progressively more technical.

This will let you understand *what* a computer is and how a CPU, GPU, RAM, etc works. It will also give you the foundational knowledge required to understand how a OS/Kernel works, how software works etc. Arguably it will also give you the tools to design all of how hardware and software components, though actually implementing this stuff will be a bit more involved, though easily achievable if you've got the time. nand2tetris, for example, is specifically about that design journey.

r5yufr,hmrjr2m,t3_r5yufr,"There's a **lot** of incorrect information in this thread. Pun intended.
 
Multi-threading was a thing long, long before multi-core CPUs were a thing. Setting a process priority to high and giving it a single-core affinity does **NOT** make it single threaded. This is misunderstanding the concept of process, thread, and core entirely.
 
What you are doing by changing those settings is ensuring that it is the only thing running on that 1 core, on the proviso that nothing *else* is being given above normal or higher priority, and that you never, ever saturate all of your other cores with other processes (which will override that priority). So in essence turning it into a single core machine as far as that software is concerned.
 
Dual- and higher- core processors were very, very new to the consumer space in 2006, with the vast majority of consumer PCs being single core, and the vast majority of consumer software being written in such a way that single core performance was what was prioritised. This doesn't mean that those programs were single-threaded - far from it, the majority were multi-threaded, so the GUI remains responsive while processing work happens in the background. For example, if you're using Internet Explorer, the page can still be loading while you type things into a search bar, you didn't have to wait for that page loading work to be complete before it could respond to your keyboard input.
 
The difference between multiple threads all running on the one core at the 'same time' and multiple cores, is that multiple threads (or processes) running on the same core don't actually run at the same time at all. Through various algorithms they are sliced, diced, and given effectively a time share of that chip's work, one after the other after the other, to fake things running at the same time. Only 1 instruction is every being worked on at the same time, but it could be some from Thread 1, some from Thread 2, some from Thread 3, then back to 1, and so on (the same for processes, it might do something for the game, then the notepad window in the background, then the OS, then the game again, picking up each thread each process has).
 
What multiple cores do is make it so that time sharing is now done across multiple things that can actually execute instructions simultaneously. So if you are dual-core there are 0-2 instructions being processed at any given instant, from up to 2 threads in up to 2 processes. And scaling up to quad-core with 4, etc etc. This means that so long as you never have 1 big-ass thread that wants all the processing power, a dual-core CPU can be twice as fast as a single core, quad-core is 4x faster so long as you have 4 threads that want all that power, etc.
 
The reason the game is crashing when it is running on multiple cores is because the code that it uses to manage its threads (so they don't all try to change the same data, or so that thread 1 that is waiting on some calculations from thread 2 doesn't start too early, etc) was written when there was a physical guarantee that 2 instructions on 2 threads would not happen at the same exact time. When it is on multiple cores, this guarantee disappears, and that thread management fails. There are a bunch of technical reasons this may occur, usually from attempting to do things more quickly (2006 consumer PC hardware was not fantastic by modern standards) and skipping various safety checks.

r5yufr,hmqh70s,t1_hmqde7r,"Ah, got it, I assumed this was something you were working on yourself.

To give you a little bit more information, running a program single-threaded (what your workaround does) causes each line of the program to happen sequentially, as if you were running through the code by hand. Running multi-threaded allows you to run different chunks of code in parallel, giving you way more power, but it’s a perfect example of “With great power comes great responsibility.” If you don’t make sure that the multiple threads “play nice” with each other, you could run into issues.

A *race condition* is some bug that only expresses itself when the threads get scheduled in a certain way. The first example you’re normally given is

> Imagine a program that creates 2 threads, that we’ll call Ping and Pong. The Ping thread will access a global variable, lets say Score, and increment it by 1, 1000 times, and the Pong thread will access Score and decrement it by 1, also 1000 times.

The logical conclusion is that, at the end of the program, Score would be equal to 0 because we incremented it 1000 times and decremented it 1000 times. However, what’ll most likely happen is that it’ll be left with some non-zero value because the threads didn’t “play nice” with it. This is because you need to first access Score in memory, update it, then replace it in memory.

If the Ping and Pong threads grab the value of the Score at the same time, increment and decrement respectively, and then reassign to Score, whose value actually made it? Does the new value of Score reflect the increment that Ping did, or the decrement that Ping did? The answer is: it’s entirely dependent on how your OS schedules the threads. When you learn about this topic in your studies, you’ll learn about things like “semaphores” or, more generally, “locks” which are mechanism to help make sure your threads “play nice.”

Deadlocking is a concept that comes up once locking is being used. In that Ping Pong example, we can make the threads play safe by using a lock on Score, so Ping and Ping are only allowed to modify the value of Score if they currently hold the lock we associate with Score, which prevents the scenario from earlier where they overwrite each other’s work. Once your program gets more complicated and multiple locks are at play, you may end up with a situation where one thread says “I won’t free up/release/give back my lock on **X** until I get I get a lock on **Y**” while another thread says “I won’t free up/release/give back my lock on **Y** until I get I get a lock on **X**”. That battle over locks causes your program to come to a screeching halt, since neither thread will give up their lock until they get the other, which is why it’s called a deadlock.

Maybe, maybe not. For enterprise applications you usually have a lot of microprocesses all doing different things in the backend.

r4xo16,hmjmfsd,t3_r4xo16,"Being more specific with parameters would make it a different method. One thing I think you are confusing is the difference between accepting and requiring.

Your code has the `Animal.speak` method which requires a `LoudSpeaker` parameter and returns a string. This means any subtype of `Animal` must have a method that *accepts* a `LoudSpeaker` and returns a string (or string subtype?).

Being more specific (covariant) with the return type doesn't violate the method contract. If you returned a subtype of string (is that possible with string?) your are still by definition returning a string.

Being more specific with the parameters does violate the method contract. If the `Cat.speak` method *required* a `ScreamingSpeaker` (i.e., the method definition specifies it) then it can no longer *accept* a `LoudSpeaker`. Keep in mind that the  `speak` method can still *accept* a `ScreamingSpeaker` when you call it. If you wanted `Cat` to only take `ScreamingSpeaker` you could detect the type of the passed argument and throw an exception (or return null or whatever) if it is not a `ScreamingSpeaker` but since the method signature did not change that is **not** being covariant with the parameters.

Being less specific (contravariant) with parameters is allowed because it still fulfills the method contract. If `Cat` can take (requires) a more general `Speaker` in it's `speak` method, then it still *accepts* a `LoudSpeaker`.

I'm not sure what you mean on line 37 with ""According to LSP I shouldn't pass in LoudSpeaker here?"" because that is wrong. The `Animal.speak` method *requires* a `LoudSpeaker` which means it can also *accept* a `ScreamingSpeaker`.

I understand I can pass in anything at runtime. What I'm saying is that Liskovs Substitution Principle dictates (as I understand it) that if the parent class's method (Animal.speak) requires a Loudspeaker, then the child class's method (Cat.speak) can only require a Loudspeaker or it's parent Speaker as a parameter.

So the methods themselves, because they are in a subtype relationship, must be *contravariant*.

There still seems to me to be a disconnect here. I'm sure I'm still misunderstanding something, I don't think I've found a formal flaw or anything like that but on it's surface it appears that LSP has an implicit contradiction.

Forget about the classes. I'm looking at all the functions in that code whether they are methods or not, and I'm wondering why some functions have to be covariant in their inputs and adhere to LSP and why some (subtype methods) have to be contravariant in order to adhere to LSP.

This is nearly correct. The *parameters* of the method *may* be contravariant. The `Cat.speak` method can require a `LoudSpeaker` or any parent-type in the method definition. This allows the method to still accept a `LoudSpeaker` but it may also accept a more general (parent) type.

>However, any other function, in order to adhere to LSP must be covariant in their parameters.

Not quite sure what you mean here. Are you referring to the parameters that are passed in when the function is called? Taking the function with the definition `speak(LoudSpeaker $speaker)` and calling it with `speak(new ScreamingSpeaker())` is not covariance it's just polymorphism. A `ScreamingSpeaker` *is* a `LoudSpeaker` so it can be taken as a parameter. If `Cat` overrides it with `speak(Speaker $speaker)` (being contravariant), then you can still call it with `speak(new ScreamingSpeaker())` but you could also do `speak(new Speaker())` or `speak(new QuietSpeaker())` where `QuietSpeaker` exteneds `Speaker`.

r4v7w6,hmj2d2w,t3_r4v7w6,"Disclaimer: not a C# programmer but I do know a thing or two about memory.

I'm not 100% sure what you mean by memory stack, as you've mentioned the same theoretical structure used in two different places: the stack data structure. I'm going to assume you wanna know about the ""stack memory"" used by programs during function calls.

First off: there are different types of memory at your disposal when you write programs:

1. Text : this is where the source code of your program resides. If someone (or something) tries to change it, you'll get an error as it's read-only
2. Data and BSS : these two are used by variables and objects that live during the whole lifetime of  your program. So global and static variables are usually stored there (at least in C and C++)
3. Heap : this is dynamic memory which you can request from your OS for your program. Of course, if there's not enough free memory, you'll get some indication of failure (nullptr in C++ and maybe an exception in higher-level languages)
4. Stack : I assume this is what you wanna know about. Whenever you call a function, your compiler has to allocate some space to be used by the parameters and local variables of that function. Also, you want to store a pointer to place from which you called the function, so that you can return to that place after the function finishes executing. Now, this ""stack"" is fundamentally no different than the user-defined stack data structures created by programmers in languages like C and C++ (some higher-level languages provide stack data structures as part of their standard libraries). The practical difference is just that the memory stack happens to be a useful data structure when dealing with function calls and is used by the compiler when it emits assembly code (this is what C/C++ compilers do, not so sure about C#). You can see PUSH and POP instructions if you disassemble an executable. It's what computer scientists call a LIFO structure (last element that goes in is the first one to come out), which makes perfect sense in the context of function calls since you want to free up space (i.e. pop) used by the variables of the last function you called so that the next function has a fresh memory space to work with, while you also want to make sure to keep the memory used by the functions higher up the call chain untouched.

Why is this important? Couple of important considerations:

1. Stack tends to be faster. I say tends to because I've worked in some environments where the difference in performance between stack and heap is negligible. That being said, in many environments stack seems to be much faster than heap. So prefer it whenever you can.
2. It tends to be more memory-constrained than heap. You can't just shove gigabytes of data into it and expect things to go smoothly. Sometimes it can happen even when there is no obvious indication that you're shoving a lot of data into it. For example, remember when I said the location from which you called the function is saved into the stack? Well, in a more popular scenario when a programmer forgets to put an exit condition in a recursive function (google it if you don't know, it's basically a function ending up calling itself infinite amount of times) then you will get a ""stack overflow"" since all those saved pointers end up filling the stack. You can overflow stack much quicker in embedded systems with limited resources, than on a desktop gaming PC.

That's what I can think of now. I hope more experienced programmers will elaborate more on this issue and maybe even find a fault in my own answer",10,0,0,0,10,False,False,False,1638192944.0

    def myFunction(y /* not a function variable */) = {
      val z = 10 // function variable
      return x + y + z
    }

So if you had some code like 

    def myFunction2(n) = {
      val pi = 3.14
      // breakpoint 1
      return n + pi
    }
    def myFunction1(n) = {

      val y = myFunction2(n)
      val z = x + y
      // breakpoint 2
      return z
    }
    myFunction1(1)

then at `breakpoint1` your stack would look like

    3.14
    5

then at `breakpoint2` it would look like

    9.14
    4.14
    5

notice that at `breakpoint2` our `3.14` is gone. because once `myFunction2` returned, then the stack pointer (pointer to the top of the stack) was moved back to the location it was at before the function was called. thus `3.14` was overwritten with `y` and `z`.

hopefully this makes sense to you, if not I'm sure there are lots of great intro CS / unmanaged language classes online that can explain i more depth.

r4v7w6,hmm26uf,t3_r4v7w6,"Others' answers give good context. This may be a bit more direct:

The ""call stack"" is basically like a C# `Stack` of ""stack frames"". The OS sets aside memory for the call stack before a program starts. **A stack frame contains all the information needed to return from a function call and give back control to the caller.** This information is usually just a ""return address"", which is a pointer to the instruction that should be executed after returning.

A stack frame can also store local variables and function arguments. This is different from a C# `Stack`, which only stores one type of value. The compiler will keep track of the size of each function's stack frame, so the return address can still be found by popping that many values off the stack.

Source code is compiled into a list of simple instructions that the CPU can execute. These instructions operate on tiny chunks of memory inside the CPU called registers. Some instructions are loads or stores, which move data between registers and RAM. Some instructions are arithmetic, which just manipulate the contents of registers. Some instructions also do both.

**There are usually dedicated registers for the ""stack pointer"", which is the address of the top of the call stack, and the ""instruction pointer"", which is the address of the next instruction to execute.** The instructions that operate on these dedicated registers are the answer to your question. 

Most CPUs have instructions dedicated to manipulating the stack pointer. A `PUSH %reg` instruction will increment the stack pointer and store the contents of the general-purpose register `%reg` at that address. A `POP %reg` instruction does the reverse. The compiler can use `PUSH` and `POP` instructions in pairs, or manipulate the stack pointer directly, to store as many local variables as each function needs without losing track of the return address.

Most instructions implicitly increment the instruction pointer. A `JUMP` instruction instead explicitly overwrites the instruction pointer, so control transfers to a new location. **A `CALL` instruction pushes the instruction pointer onto the stack before jumping, like a combination of `JUMP label` and `PUSH %ip`. A `RET` instruction does the opposite of `CALL`, which is essentially `POP %ip`. This is how function calls and returns use the stack.**",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1638239256.0

Atlasing allows you to pack textures into a single file, normally minimizing the amount of empty space around sprites (thusly size required to store images in memory), and store metadata which is useful in the logic and rendering part of your code.  

The GPU can now use one or two textures instead of switching context between multiple textures residing in memory.  It is hard to understate how big of an improvement texture atlases can be to your rendering times (and it is worth doing because it is simple to do).  A good experiment would be to build two like projects rendering a hundred 2D sprites, stationary, but one utilizes an atlas and the other has every sprite in a separate file.  You will see the importance then.

One of the techniques I like, since I don't like having all of my images in one file, is to build atlases on the fly in memory during scene changes in the game.  I'll have all relevant information for the graphics at that point.

Recall that an NP-complete problem X is simply:

Intuitively, assuming Y is in NP and there exists a polynomial reduction from the NP-complete problem X to Y, Y becomes an NP-complete problem as follows:

2. From X, reduce this problem to Y in polynomial time. This is possible since this is assumed.

r2e13s,hm585sg,t3_r2e13s,"Not necessarily.

One thing is that from your question, you only mentioned ""X reduces to Y"", but does not specify what kind of reduction it is. This I can already imply, there is no information on how difficult Y is.

To give a fun example (I like to argue by using examples), consider X = sorting an array of n integers. This is in polynomial (in P), and this is trivial to verify. Then, if I were suddenly feeling cute and decide to come up with this Y:

1. Set up an email connection
2. For each integer i, do:
   1. Compose a message; specify that the message should only arrive on the ith day after the sending date; set the receiver to self
   2. Add the message to the Message Array
3. Send everything out in the Message Array

>Listen to the incoming email connection and print out the results. On the 1st day you will receive 1 (if there exists any ""1"" in the original array), on the 2nd day you will receive 2, ... ad infinitum

Then the complexity suddenly becomes much higher, because literally another computer is required to do this job (sending the email back to you). Also, sorting integers (X -(reduce)> Y) suddenly becomes unbounded.

It is important to specify the kind of reduction you are talking about. But let's say you are talking about polynomial reduction. It still doesnt say anything about whether Y is NP-complete or not. If I find some Y which is in P (or more realistically, where Y is in EXPONENTIAL) then I would have disproved your idea.

In fact as others may have pointed out, if someone happened to find some Y such that Y is in P, then they would have solved P = NP and would become famous. It is just that no one have found such algorithm of Y and so I cannot give any examples to this. ""People can only think of NP"" does NOT imply ""there is only NP in this world"".

\-------

Actually in situations like this, it is often reversed: I want to know what kind of problem X is, and so I try my best to reduce X to some ""simplest"" problem Y, and I literally cannot get more simpler than Y. But oh look, Y is e.g. in NP! So unfortunately X will have to be in NP too.

This mindset can be useful if you happen to also want to explore undecidability. In the broader scheme of things, P, NP, EXPONENTIAL, ... all are in ""DECIDABLE"", and for Turing, one of his contribution was that he found a whole bunch of problems that were ""UNDECIDABLE"", i.e., you literally will never get any result if you tell any Turing machine (e.g. a modern computer) to ""go calculate it"".

This is what you'd call a stage 1 bootloader, it simply starts up, detects your boot device, and then moves to the next stage. (The BIOS does a lot more at the initial stage, but we aren't concerned with it for now).

The Master Boot Record is the first disk block and this is where the real booting process starts. This is the very beginning of your disk partition. The MBR stores the first stage boot loader and the disk partition table.

After the BIOS phase is completed, MBR starts to scan the partition table and loads up the Volume Boot Record, VBR is basically what partitions (and what kind) this particular disk has.   


Just like MBR, VBR's initial segment has what partition type and size the partitions in this particular volume are, followed with the Initial Program Loader (IPL).   
This IPL is our second stage bootloader, which is basically coded to actually load our operating system. (Depending on what kind of operating system you are using, IPL will load up another program that will actually bring the contents of the operating system to the main memory and make it ready for execution).    
Like for example, IPL will load up the NT loader for windows which actually loads up the content of the windows operating system. Or IPL will load up GRUB for Linux.  These would then follow different stages to load up the operating system. 

All in all, it's a complex chaining process that starts from static code and then points you to another location where more sequence of actions are stored. 

(Also most machines now use UEFI over BIOS).  
(Another fun fact, this process can be abused to load up malware or even prevent the completion of the bootloader process. A lot can be done with this since the initial code is actually a static sequence, and if able to tinker with it, the threat actor has a lot of power)

r27cn1,hm68jtv,t1_hm5cc72,"I think the intention is to make functions which take decimal inputs that look like binary, then emulate logic systems even when they have multiple inputs and outputs.

If we write `1001` in binary, we're talking about `9` in decimal. But here, we want `1001` in *decimal* as a result of a binary system with 4 outputs, using decimal math.

The whole thing doesn't seem particularly useful. Admittedly, I'm having trouble sifting through the rah-rah here, the OPs word salad, and the math errors, but that's my takeaway.

If we think of [a full-adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Full-adder_logic_diagram.svg), we have two inputs X and Y, plus a carry input Z. (I'm using the OPs input variables, the image I linked uses A, B, and C instead.) It outputs two bits: sum and carry, which you can conveniently think of as a two digit binary number with carry as the MSB and sum as the LSB.

The goal appears to be to write a function that does this all in *decimal*, such that `f(1,1,1)` for example, results in `11` *decimal*. The function would have this truth table: 

X|Y|Z (Carry)|Result
:--|:--|:--|:--
0|0|0|0
0|0|1|1
0|1|0|1
0|1|1|10
1|0|0|1
1|0|1|10
1|1|0|10
1|1|1|11

It's important to remember these functions have very limited domains: `x` and `y` and `z` can be 0 or 1, and absolutely nothing else ... even though the function definition looks like a plain old polynomials over the reals.

The function given for a full adder:

> Heres an adder that takes a carry and 2 bits and outputs the binary in:
> x+y+z+8xy+8xz+8yz+16xyz

is pretty obviously incorrect, as we're finding.

I think we're a lot closer with this (tested):

    x + y - 2xy + z - 2z(x + y - 2xy) + 10(xy + z(x + y - 2xy) - xyz(x + y - 2xy))

which simplifies a bit (untested):

    y + z + 8yz + 10yzx^2(-1 + 2y) +  x(1 + y(8 - 16z) + 8z - 10zy^2)

Does work and is far more compact then the solution you had, mostly because 0\^2 or 1\^2 are totally meaning less and since xy and z all are ones and zeros you will find that you can just remove them and then cancel down.

I don't really understand your first paragraph. It does not make much sense to me. I think perhaps you are misunderstanding the term hostile as it applies to AI ethics. As I posted elsewhere, hostile in that context means unaligned or incompatible with human needs or desires. It does not imply maliciousness or anything to do with ants.

As for the second paragraph, this same can be true for any safety-critical piece of software. Flawed software can have serious repercussions whether AI-based or not. As for the last sentence, this is simply fundamentally flawed (in my view anyway) and based on science fiction or pure speculation (usually from non-experts, such as Elon Musk). ASI does not mean that it can do everything, and it certainly does not mean it can do the impossible. It is in fact quite possible to examine ASI in a scholarly way by making reasonable extrapolations based on what we know about AI. Of course, even such work is speculative because we do not really know much about ASI (see my other posts), but at least it is justified by existing literature.

If you're really interested in this, then I'd suggest looking at some works on AI ethics. There are some good works on ASI as well. Nick Bostrom as written some works on the dangers of ASI (which I personally feel are flawed), and then there are a number of good rebuttals to his arguments. So this is a good place to start.

My argument is that the potential caliber of ASI, when applied to certain dimensions or areas, could potentially have indefinite negative repercussions, and we lack the capacity to even forecast such repercussions.

r0ss7l,hlx33x1,t3_r0ss7l,"I'd say those are two entirely different kinds of problems.

Running code compiled for one instruction set architecture on a different ISA usually comes at a steep performance cost since perhaps the most straightforward solution -- emulating the other CPU with software -- is slow. I don't know how Rosetta works in detail, but since it's either JIT or AOT (ahead-of-time) compiling the x86-64 machine code to its native ARM code, and the compiled ARM code is then run on the CPU, it can achieve much better performance than outright emulation.

Other than that, an application running through Rosetta is still code that has been built to run on an Apple OS, running on an Apple OS. Apple knows all the system calls and any other macOS APIs that an application can make use of; it's their design after all. Since they (probably?) still have the implementations of those same APIs in their OS, now just running on ARM, Rosetta can just mechanically make whatever modifications are required to the machine code so that the system calls now work on the ARM version, and re-link the application executables with the ARM version of any library ABIs provided by the operating system, and whatever else they need to do. (I don't know if re-linking is what they're doing, and I'm speculating, but the point is that once they've got the translation logic done right and all the corner cases working, it's a mechanical translation. Most of the APIs themselves are probably still identical in content. The implementation of the binary interfaces just differs, and the difference is systematic.)

It's still a nice piece of work, but Apple essentially knows and controls all the pieces of the puzzle. They also had time to prepare.

Supporting a modern operating system on a particular piece of hardware is a different thing. An OS needs to be able to work with the specific hardware on which it's running. This requires not only compiling the code for the correct CPU instruction set, but also being able to properly communicate with any other device-specific hardware such as the GPU (integrated in case of the M1) and the motherboard chipset. A modern operating system also needs to deal with power saving modes for all of that, and so on.

Writing the code to do this, not to mention figuring out how the hardware works exactly if no detailed public documentation is available, is a lot of work that has to be done for each individual component that a machine might have. Also, I don't know what if any documentation regarding these on the M1 is publicly available, but Apple isn't exactly the kind of a company to go out of their way to release technical information they don't need to.

The same is of course fundamentally true about running Linux or Windows on any other random hardware regardless of the CPU architecture. However, the new Apple hardware brings in a lot of new components to the mix, and there probably isn't a lot of public documentation available for non-Apple developers. Also, if it were some random laptop from some random brand not working well with Linux, you just wouldn't have heard about it. You hear about the M1 because it's Apple.

qzwb8e,hlph3vq,t3_qzwb8e,"Hi we had a course on big data last year. To break down one approach is the following.

1. Get Hadoop set up on a system. If you have a cluster available by your school/university, definitely request access, as it will massively increase what you can do for this project.

2. Once set up, build a map reduce job. This is the most important part. When you work with big amounts of data, you need some way to quickly traverse this data, and filter only those relevant results to be displayed. An example dataset could be  found at https://commoncrawl.org. You can take an entire segment of the entire set if you can get a large cluster. NOTE THIS IS MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF TERABYTES. Otherwise use the indexer to find a smaller sample dataset. 

3. Now how do you map reduce. The idea is simple: You have several cycles where each element is mapped, filtered and shuffled throughout the entire Hadoop cluster. These operations often can be done in parallel and are really trivial by themselves. Important is to ensure that you bring the data to the point of computation, not the other way around. Network traffic will be a large bottle neck. Instructions on how to do this are available online.

Updating:

Retrieving:  
A few waves of search for ""s"" in the hashmap, starting from most important to least.  
Search one:  
look for exact matches of s  
Loop as many times as you think it's necessary:  
generate similar strings to s, s'. Search for s'

* every next loop is on s', s'', s''' etc
* if your ""network"" was created first, you gotta search through the entire thing unfortunately and update your map

qzwb8e,hlpto9w,t3_qzwb8e,"A search engine is a variable beast - there are a whoooooole lot of steps to take, each step of which is technically a search engine, and notably **does not have to operate on websites to be one**. One that worked on your lecture slides for the class would be just as valid.
 
First, you have the most basic 'return by exact match on field'. You have a database, you go through that database and pluck out the matching elements by title, or keyword, or author.
 
Next, you can apply rules to those searches - This AND That AND The Other Thing OR Something Else. Many search engines are sitting here, for example https://www.scopus.com/
 
The step after that is 'content based' searching, which is going to look at the body of the material and look through there, including all your rules and whatnot (this is not difficult for function, but is a nightmare for optimisation).
 
Next after that you have internal, implicit rule generation. That is things like implicit 'stemming' of words, synonyms or close to them, and other basic natural language processing 'pre-processing' steps. There is still no machine learning at this stage, just related steps you would normally do before throwing it into your algorithms. (note: this is probably the step I would recommend for a good 2nd, average 3rd year programming assignment in a data science curriculum, perhaps excluding body content).
 
After that you add machine learning for natural language processing. You start looking at the connections between words, related topic, density of the topic in the elements being found, working out subject/object, etc etc etc. This has no indefinite end and is where Google spends a significant amount of their time and money.
 
But that's just core functional capabilities. You have non-core and non-functional capabilities as well, of which the most important are probably weighting and optimisation. Weighting is being able to take your matches and assign them a weight. Easy at the lower ends of core functionality (how many rules did they match, and how often do they match them?), when you get into the pre-processing you need to look at how much pre-processing was necessary - so if you searched for 'speedily', then the ranks for matches would probably go speedily->speed->fast, for example. And when you're into NLP land it gets much more complex.

If this is a passion project and you decide to do more on it (or maybe this is within your scope anyway), Google relies more and more on ML/AI methods in their search to allow you to search with meaning/concepts - Elasticsearch and BM25 will not be able to do any of that for you, they rely more on word matching (which does still work well, but means that you need to choose the correct words). If you're interested in the ML/AI version, you need two 'pillars' - vector similarity search and NLP models (typically transformers like BERT).

It's super fascinating imo and worth looking into, for the NLP models intro I [wrote this](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/dense-vector-embeddings-nlp/), and for the vector similarity search (or 'semantic' search when used with NLP) [I wrote a 'course'](https://jamescalam.medium.com/free-course-on-vector-similarity-search-and-faiss-9b3e91a91384?sk=b5cb406932f62c1fb69eb0944efba92c).

The trick to that particular problem in OOP, as I see it, is in recognizing inheritance as a secondary feature of the paradigm (the primary feature being just polymorphic message passing). My first language was modular and procedural, so I actually had a bit of difficulty learning OOP as a concept (with Java 6) probably due to the fact that I was so used to thinking procedurally. Whatever the reason for my troubles, learning Smalltalk, with which I quickly replaced Java as my main OOP language, was immensely helpful in elucidating for me the core of OOP and thus in helping me to gain an intuition for what complex OOP software should look like from a high level.

All this to say that focusing upon inheritance relationships (aka ""is a"" relationships) tends to result in hierarchies that are difficult to follow or even to formulate in the first place, which is the issue you mention. Instead of using inheritance, try using interfaces, (or whatever ad-hoc class level polymorphism your language provides). This is a key element in an approach to OOP that is often referred to as ""composition over inheritance.""

For a while, try writing OOP programs using no inheritance at all (other than mandatory inheritance, like from Object in Java, ofc). I don't believe that inheritance is always evil, but refusing to use it is a good way to train yourself to not have to, and thus to become more flexible and better able to accurately model the domain of your software.

It might be easier to understand in the reverse direction. If we want to pack two integer bytes, 7 and 208, we multiply 7 by 256, then add 208.

7 * 256 + 208 = 2000

If you're familiar with bitwise operations, multiplying by 256 is equivalent to left shifting by 8, which makes room for a new byte in the least-significant position. Likewise, dividing by 256 is equivalent to right shifting by 8. Modulo 256 selects only the least-significant byte (equivalent to bitwise AND 255).

Viruses typically exploit security issues in programs to trick those programs into executing (e.g. sometimes E-Mail programs automatically attempt to download attachments, trip up and then execute these attachments because someone fucked up while programming them).  


Viruses also don't ""duplicate all over the system"". That's not how any of this works. A virus is a computer program. Its primary goal is to get executed, so that it can do its malicious activitiy. A virus especially wants to get executed after a restart, or when the user deletes the original file. Hence, the virus copies itself to a few new folders, and registers these copies of itself as programs to be run when booting the system.

Trojans typically exploit the user by masquerading as a useful program. They often even perform a normal function besides their malicios activity so that the user does not become suspicious.

A virus (or any kind of malware) is made of program code.

What separates viruses or malware from any other programs is that their program code 1) attempts to do something malicious, and 2) malware usually tries to include itself in your computer's startup programs or other startup routines so that their code is automatically executed whenever you start your computer.

Malware might also have some other kinds of tricks to make itself harder to detect, for example.

Fundamentally, though, malware is just program code. Program code only does something when it's being run, one way or another; it doesn't do anything by sitting on the disk. In fact, a better way of looking at it might be not to consider the program code as doing something (malicious or otherwise) by itself; rather, when you run a program, the operating system and the computer's CPU take the program code they find in the program file and start doing what the program code says.

If the code on the storage device is encrypted, it's not a question of whether it can ""escape"" from somewhere. The program code that has been encrypted does not make sense as program code, and it doesn't look like program code to the operating system or to the computer: it cannot be executed in the first place, so it cannot be doing anything, inside or outside of that folder. It's just inert bytes.

In that sense it doesn't necessarily make sense to say that encryption ""works both ways"", as it's not as if the virus is alive but being contained within the encrypted container somehow and restricted from accessing the rest of the system by the encryption.

You're correct that if malware code has been encrypted, and it's not being decrypted (or the password simply isn't available), the malware can't possibly be doing something. However, that's not really ""the other way around"": it's exactly the same way that encryption works for any other files. MS Office cannot open an encrypted Word document that hasn't been decrypted; the CPU cannot execute program code that has been encrypted without it being decrypted first.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1637422621.0

But they all are basically applications that run on each router, send packets of information to directly attached neighboring routers, and build up some kind of internal state about what the network “looks like” from which they decide what the routing table should be.

The definition of what’s a field or another is highly debatable. A good analogy is to see the human knowledge as a continuous variable, and fields of knowledge being our attempt to discretize it.

Applied Computer Science which IMO is by far the most important part of the field, spreads across all other fields, e.g Computational Biology, Computational Chemistry, and even Computational Sociology. These fields couldn’t care less about proofs btw. So, how do we classify it? Are those subfields, mixed fields? 

By current standards of what constitutes a field, I dispute the idea of CS not being one in its own, but it doesn’t really matter.

The labels for each discipline of study exists because of the location where the locus of study is centred around. It's not surprising that there are overlapping themes, lessons, and tools that are shared between the distinct disciplines. The main idea is that the discipline of study is large enough that it deserves its own label to distinguish where is the locus of attention; the main idea is that the discipline has enough people thinking about the specific lessons for whatever motivation they decide.

Applied computer science exists upon the foundation set by the study discipline that we call computer science. No matter where you choose to apply the lessons of computer science, the foundational lessons of computer science remain a discipline of thought that exists without regard for application into real world practice. I consider applied CS to chemistry as computational chemistry. Formal proofs are still important within computational chemistry based on lessons learned within CS. 

For example, one lesson of general CS is that we can calculate the runtime cost and the runspace cost of any given computation. We can analyse whether the computation in question is a solution within P-time. We can analyse whether the problem itself is possible to be solved as a P-problem. If we find that the problem is a ""hard problem"", this means we won't be able to completely solve the problem on normal computers. One way to deal with this in the real world is to find a partial solution the problem. Or perhaps we find that the problem is so difficult that it's not actually possible to find a computation that gives a partial solution; we give up on trying to solve the specific problem and try to reformulate the problem into something that is feasible. Your average computer programmer who is untrained in these matters cannot apply this kind of analysis to the problem they are trying to solve; they could probably apply a naive ""hard"" solution because they don't know any better. This is just one lesson that is the consequence of understanding the cost of problems and computations, there are many other useful lessons that are a normal part of the computer science discipline.

I like to distinguish the discipline of computer science and the discipline of computer programming as being not the same discipline; you don't need computer science training to work as a computer programmer.

But in many languages the self-modification of code is just a natural part of writing programs. Think about how in Python decorators work by dynamically defining an inner function. Or consider the low-level details of how Python works, how basically everything is a `dict`.

There is a related concept called [homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity). A language is homoiconic if you can manipulate code as if it were data. Lisp and Prolog are the usually cited examples, but for me it was Mathematica that really made the concept click in my brain. In Mathematica, functions are just expressions that have a particular evaluation discipline.  So you might construct a mathematical function, say, and then apply that function to a list of values.  Or you might start with a function and then deconstruct the pieces of the function. For example, your function might be a polynomial, and your program might make decisions based on the degree or coefficients of the polynomial. Seasoned Mathematica programmers don't restrict the dynamic manipulation of code to just mathematical functions.

To put it simply, it's a known fact that any task you can do in programming, you can do in Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional.

The biggest way I can highlight the advantage of Functional is this: If you want to break down working code into its most indivisible units that still work, what you're going to be left with varies on which it is. Procedural will likely leave you the whole program. Object-Oriented will frequently leave you monolithic Objects with large supporting libraries. Functional will leave you with... one line. 

And that makes all the world of difference. If you're hopping into some new code, Procedural requires you understand the entire program.   
Object Oriented requires you understand the object, the connected libraries, the state, the variables, the ways output can vary from the object, etc.   
Functional requires you to understand one line. 

Further, Functional is insanely more reusable than Object Oriented since it's so atomic. Anything you've done before, you can treat like a buffet table, grabbing what you need.

And sometimes you use one tool wrapped in another because it solves the problem better.

qxixkk,hlg8eas,t3_qxixkk,"1. The conceptual simplicity of pure functions allows compilers to perform some elaborate optimizations they otherwise couldn't. E.g. [Elm is blazing-fast and builds small bundles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-with-benchmarks-2019-update-4be0d3c78075/), and Haskell performs favourably in benchmarks relative to other high-level languages, sometimes approaching the speed of e.g. C. (YMMV, sufficiently complex Haskell applications tend to have hard-to-debug space leaks owing to ""laziness"", though the community has been moving towards more strictness in I/O, and laziness is not a feature of all functional languages. The community has also been building more understanding of how to fix these issues in recent years.)
2. Fearless refactoring. When people talk about ""functional programming"" these days, they often implicitly include a static ML-family type system. These expressive type systems allow you to encode a lot of information, preventing nonsensical states from being represented in the language. E.g., it's generally impossible to represent an out-of-bounds enum member in Haskell, unlike in C. When adding a new variant of a data type, the compiler will enforce that you handle it in all of your switch statements. Also, impure functions are carefully restricted into the IO type and every type ""inheriting"" from it (i.e. every instance of the MonadIO class). That means that when you're refactoring non-IO code, you can be sure that you haven't introduced an error merely by changing the sequence it's written in.
3. Effective abstraction encouraging uniform interfaces. Historically, software engineering has taken a very unscientific approach to design patterns. But many of them are patterns that are studied by computer scientists and mathematicians. There are arbitrary API differences in many languages between strings, arrays and vectors, but Haskell (specifically via its ML-style type system) allows a high degree of polymorphism for functions acting on these types.

Purely functional languages like Haskell, Clean, etc. have their own solutions to this problem.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1637373470.0
qxixkk,hlf8gu8,t1_hlbn4ak,"I work on a production Haskell codebase.
Basically, you do have state. Haskell allows you to allocate memory and pass/modify it by reference.

These actions have to occur in an expression with the type IO. But the top level entrypoint, `main`, has the type IO, and so there's no fundamental barrier to using state at the top level.

You use pure functions as the default, since the compiler can so aggressively optimize them with out-of-order execution and fusion. But for things that have to be stateful, you give them the type IO, which effectively just turns those optimizations off and makes the machine execute your function line by line like an imperative program.

There are more elaborate APIs people often wrap IO with, but that's the basic idea.

Edit: the other big reason to use pure functions, beyond compiler optimizations, is that you can eliminate while classes of runtime errors from ever occurring. Pure functions should never throw an exception or close a socket when it shouldn't have, etc.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1637438325.0

There are also db browsers which are basically a frontend client for interacting with the database; you can execute sql, see the results of queries, explore the database, ect. This is how most developers would interact with the database. There is also usually some sort of API for a website backend or data pipeline to interact with.

There's a myriad of different concepts that go into a database, do you have a more specific question on how they work?

The biggest tip that I have for this is to try not to overcomplicate like I mentioned before.

qvrimr,hkz121g,t3_qvrimr,"Directed Acyclic graph is a directed graph which doesn't have cycles. This is useful if you want to solve something like constrained scheduling, eg. chalk out a sequence of activities where some activities depend on others to complete. So if you hypothetically have a case where job A requires job B to complete and job B requires job A to complete, you have a cyclic Directed graph, and you cannot have a topological order (so you cannot logically draw out a sequence for doing those jobs). On the other hand, if job B required job C and C required A, you have a DAG and you can solve the job ordering problem (A->C->B).

In general, a directed graph can have cycles. A DAG is a special kind of directed graph.

In order to understand memory representation of a DAG, you have to understand memory representation of an ordinary, ""undirected"" graph. An undirected graph is a set of vertices and the edges joining them. Say you have V vertices and E edges between them, so you represent the graph as follows:

* You represent the vertices as an array of length V, having indices from 0 to V-1.
* Each array entry 'arr\[v\] 'points to a (linked) list of vertices 'w' which are connected to the vertex 'v', where v is any integer between 0 and V - 1. The list of vertices is called the Adjacency list, or 'adj'.
* So for example, if vertices v and w are connected, v will have w in its adjacency list and w will have v in its adjacency list.
* When you add an edge to the graph, say add\_edge(a, b), b will be appended to a's adjacency list and a will be appended to b's adjacency list (since in an Undirected Graph, edge a-b is same as b-a --- and *this is where a directed graph differs from an undirected graph*)

Now, in a directed graph, edge a-b means edge a->b, and edge a-b and b-a are not the same. So when you add an edge a-b, you only add 'b' to a's adjacency list, and not 'a' to b's.

Now it is possible to have 3 edges a-b, b-c and c-a in a directed graph, which will cause a directed cycle. That's all.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1637145202.0

Concurrency and parallelism are more general concepts, and they can take place in several different ways and in different kinds of contexts. Concurrency and parallelism are relevant to the OS concept of multitasking, but they're really concepts of a different level.

Out of those two, concurrency means being able to execute more than one thread of control so that their executions overlap. The threads can be from the same or from different processes. The execution doesn't necessarily take place at the same actual moment, i.e. it may be that any particular moment in time only one thread of control is being executed.

Parallelism means actually being able to perform multiple operations at the same moment.

Well, yeah. Or so that the OS or its user can switch between multiple applications or programs without having to terminate one of them first. You'll generally want the OS to be able to switch between them quickly and relatively often so that switching between applications is fluent and so that your music doesn't break up and so that a web server can get around to responding to requests quickly. You want it to be fast enough to *look* like the computer can run multiple things at once. Technically, however, it's multitasking whether it's really quick or not.

Multitasking is something you generally take for granted nowadays, as there haven't been any non-multitasking operating systems in mainstream PC use in the last ~25 years. But, well, *somebody* had to implement multitasking, and sometimes it can be useful to know how and why it works, so we still learn it.

> Parallelism will be slightly faster in performing task as it does not require constant switching between two or more jobs.

Depending on the task (or tasks) and the resources you have, it can be faster by any factor. For example, if you have *n* processor cores and your task can be divided into *n* equal parts that can be run (mostly) independently of each other -- or if you have *n* separate tasks you want to run -- you can ideally get a speedup of *n* times over doing those parts or tasks one after the other. In the best case anyway.

You might save something by not having to constantly switch (as the switching itself has a cost), but the real reason parallelism can give speedups is that it allows you to make use of the multiple cores or other parallel resources you have available.

Parallelism is kind of like dividing work between multiple workers and having them actually work and advance tasks at the same time instead of one of them working and another having to wait for the first one to finish before starting their own part.

Some tasks are easy to parallelize, but in case of other tasks it might be harder, so the speedup you can achieve might be smaller or even none.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1637102933.0

The MP944 was a collection of six chips forming a single processor unit. The TMS0100 chip was presented as a ""calculator on a chip"" with the original designation TMS1802NC. This chip contains a very primitive CPU and can only be used to implement various simple four-function calculators. It is the precursor of the TMS1000, introduced in 1974, which is considered the first microcontroller—i.e., a computer on a chip containing not only the CPU, but also ROM, RAM, and I/O functions. The MCS-4 family of four chips developed by Intel, of which the 4004 is the CPU or microprocessor, was far more versatile and powerful than the single-chip TMS1000, allowing the creation of a variety of small computers for various applications.

qu4c71,hkordik,t1_hko9khj,">But we have no idea how to write back to it.

We sorta do, conceptually. Education is all about this. As is martial arts, and sports. In fact, anyone who has ever learned anything and gone through the process of creating a repeatable ""function"" (muscle memory* is the phrase I've most often heard) out of something that used to require much more attention during the learning phase is then aware that some kind of self-write operation is a part of daily life and learning new things, beyond just being a passive sensor. If we can map what happens in the brain during other things, then it stands to reason that we could map what happens in the brain when people are intensively learning and training themselves. The idea of insta-grok technology does not seem far fetched to me, but I'm not an expert. I would add the important caveat that the brain is complex and consciousness even more so. It would probably take far longer to perfect and understand how to use such technology than it would to get it going in the first place.

I am not sure I would replace the learning process itself with a Matrix style ""insta-download-to-your-brain"" system, but it would be cool to have more control over the process which we already use when teaching ourselves things. Oftentimes training is like playing the part of both the animal and the trainer at the same time, and even if you're a smart trainer you might still also be a stubborn animal. Some people's muscle memory (and neuroplasticity, for that matter) is less stubborn than others, and easier to tame for this purpose or that. I personally enjoy the process of learning and practice, but I would enjoy having more control over it. Perhaps current Sci Fi depictions only scratch the surface of what cybernetics and biotech could allow, in theory.

But if I can, the question isn’t that we don’t understand the general process of repetition leading to acquired skill or knowledge. The question is what the actual underlying physiological process occurring during repetition is. And whether or not we could repeat that.

qu4c71,hkostqd,t1_hkoryks,"I don't think repetition alone teaches a person much. To use the sports and martial arts analogy again: you want to build mental, logical, conditional reflexes for different situations in addition to building the muscle memory of the actions themselves. In general this means applying what you've learned in a variety of situations and getting ""practice"", which is distinct from repetition, although repetition is a byproduct of practice. A surprising amount of, say, Math is about building this kind of thing so that when you see a certain kind of problem the right solution hits you like a reflex. Intuition comes from practice.

I'm not a doctor or an expert programmer (or expert anything), so I'm not sure what the current ""resolution"" limits are for making sense of brain scans. I'm skeptical because it is hard to measure the conscious meaning of even a face expression from a friend, nevermind a gazillion neurons being examined in n-dimensions of data analysis.

* Automatic generation of bibliography with references in paper order. ALL papers in every field have citations/references and numbers range from tens to hundreds. Being able to collect that in a bib file and reference a cite with a simple function is worth its weight in GOLD.

* Separation of content/structure from formatting. When writing in LaTex you write the content with minimal structural markup (like sections/subsections). Almost ALL the formatting like fonts, page layouts, etc are separate and usually GIVEN to you by the journal/conference/publisher so you don’t spend much if any time fiddling with it. For those familiar with it LaTex splits content from style kind of like HTML and CSS.

* Simple ASCII file format that is human readable makes it possible to recover from mistakes/corruption as well as collaborate using revision control systems designed for code.

qtkimi,hknwkyu,t3_qtkimi,"I’ll give some unconventional advice here. Check out Arduino, it’s a dev board based on the atmega328p microcontroller. A microcontroller is essentially a tiny computer, this particular one has 32kb flash memory, 2kb ram, and runs at 20mhz. But they’re simple, especially compared to a modern PC and operating system, much easier to grasp everything that’s going on. Typically you run them without an operating system, your code just goes right on top of the hardware and you have full access to all of the registers, you can set and read the voltages on the pins, you handle interrupts yourself, etc. You learn a lot this way.

Arduino is a good place to start, it mainly just provides a nice interface for flashing code into the microcontroller, but once you get a little more familiar with it you can use the microcontroller on its own on a breadboard, then use a programmer like the atmel-ice and AVRstudio to flash code into it, AVRstudio also has an assembler you can use as well.

After you get familiar with that you can move upto a multicore family of microcontrollers like stm32 and get exposure to concurrency this way.

The reason I recommend this route is I think these topics are best learned in their simplest possible forms and the PC ecosystem is not really the place to find that. I also think computing is best understood bottom-up instead of top-down.

There’s Arduino kits such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?crid=2RW64OFAM05ZF&keywords=arduino+kit&qid=1636939028&smid=A2WWHQ25ENKVJ1&sprefix=arduino+kit%2Caps%2C127&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMkY3OFBNOTNHQUpSJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODcwNzExMVRWOEdTTzhPSlRZRiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDAxMzc2M1RTT1dKR0NNR05TQiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3Bob25lX3NlYXJjaF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) to start with.

You can get the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) here. It’s C++.

There’s no hello world because it doesn’t have a screen but the equivalent would just be a program to blink an LED.

    void setup()
    {
        pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    }

    void loop()
    {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
        delay(1000);
    }

setup() runs at startup

loop() runs immediately after and is looped forever until power down, there’s no operating system to return to so your program can never end.

pinMode() just sets a pin as output or input, you’re either outputting a voltage on any particular pin or reading it.

LED_BUILTIN is just a constant for the pin connected to an LED on the arduino. Equal to 13 in this case.

digitalWrite() sets the state of a pin configured as an output.

HIGH and LOW are just constants for digital high and digital low, equal to 1 and 0 respectively.

delay() just loops the cpu for a given amount of milliseconds.

You can flash your code to it by hooking it up to a USB port, selecting that port in the Arduino IDE and then hitting upload.

r/embedded is good if you need help with programming it or the hardware concepts.

O(nk) can be as said on SO an outer loop with n iterations and an inner loop with k. In the case of k = n you get O(n^2 ).

O(n+k) would be on for loop with n iterations followed by a for loop with k iteration, again if k = n then you'd get O(2n) ~ O(n).

I then don't fully understand what you mean with n = 10 and k = 0.

So in the case of O(n^k ) which you could think of k nested for loops with n iterations, if k = 0 it would mean there are no nested loops, in fact no loops at all -> O(1)

In the cubic sense of O(n^2 ) there's no dependency to k. Now if you'd consider O(nk) though you'd have one loop with n iterations and a nested loop with 0 iterations. Now if the second loops doesn't do anything -> O(1).
Might be easier to think of it as the loop with k iteration being the outer loop.

1. First exposure is all about getting exposure to ideas within the book. I don't worry about remembering ideas or the way the ideas connect, I just want exposure to the ideas so I know that they exist.
2. Second reading is about considering how the ideas relate to one another. I don't worry about memorizing anything, I want to focus on a narrative that connects a weave of ideas from beginning to end.
3. Third reading is when I start to write notes if I feel like writing notes. Since I have exposure to the ideas and how they connect, I now have a simple understanding of the book, I can write effective notes about the book. If all I wanted was a simple understanding, three iterations is normally good for me.
4. Any more readings above three is to reinforce the learning that I've already done. Repeating the study material multiple times means you can pick up subtle ideas that are easy to miss when you're faced with a whole book's worth of detail.  The more repetitions you do, the stronger your imprinting for the ideas you already know, the easier it is to detect subtle details that are easy to miss. 

This strategy allowed me to read books that where initially incomprehensible to me. The value of repetition means I can (eventually) absorb ideas that have no meaning to me.

For example, take this (relatively) young new compression algorithm: [ZStandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstandard?wprov=sfla1)

qqpf3o,hk2m4d7,t3_qqpf3o,"Something to keep in mind is that file/document formats are almost never about quality/merits/capabilities of the formats. The format people use is determined by what software they, and the people they are sending documents to, have.  

A good example is JPEG. There have been a few formats that give equal or better quality images, use less space, and use about the same resources to decompress/view. Why haven't those formats pushed JPEGs out of existence? Well everyone's web browsers support JPEG and don't support fancy new format X. While it might seem practical to just say, everyone should just update their browsers' to a never version, and then we can switch. Experience has shown that this just isn't the case. And that's not getting into all the backend and image generation software on the server side, or the firmware on physical cameras, and anything like that. 

Everyday file formats aren't a matter of someone building a better mouse trap. Adobe has a lot of power in the document/image sphere because their software is entrenched there. If you can't get Adobe to make their whole software line support a PDF-successor format, that format is dead in the water. 

Put another way, file formats are a matter of economics not computer science. 

PDF files don't use a single specific compression algorithm by the way. They use a pile of them, specialized for the part of the document they are being used for. Compressing vector graphics, fonts, blocks of text, color images, and greyscale images with different algorithms that are tailored to the specific task. 

Note that while introduced in 1993, PDF was a closed, proprietary format until an open standard for it was established in 2008. The number of versions of PDF is around 10-20 I think, it has been updated/changed many times over the years. The most recent update was in December of 2020. While user visible features have certainly been introduced,fill in forms for example were added in version 1.2 in 1996, most updates have been adding encryption and compression algorithms to the multitude that PDF supports. Keep in mind that 1996 form feature is still vastly underutilized.  Being able to view a PDF, and even more so being able to 'print' anything into a PDF, without installing specific software that the user downloaded and installed (as opposed to came with their operating system) are pretty new things. 

In many ways, you could argue that PDF is more of a container format than anything else. Something that's the case for a lot of file formats nowadays. All audio/video file formats and even zip files fall into this category. The standards define a standard way of holding different hunks of data and metadata, with different formats being used by the individual hunks. A new compression algorithm can be added to the PDF standard without throwing away the format or backwards compatibility.

I am curious if there is anything about PDF you find lacking. Of course, file using less space is nice, but that applies to all files. I'm sure that most people, even in CS, don't know the majority of the features that PDF even support. I'd definitely include myself in that category.",9,0,0,1,9,False,False,False,1636555195.0

qpu9g8,hjxjzeh,t3_qpu9g8,"Somewhat of a simplified answer, but I think this conveys the jist of what you’re asking for.

So first understand what a [Boolean function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) is. Every function of a processor is built as one of those, the mov, ldr, str, etc. will be a function of ones and zeros being input, and translates to a certain series of ones and zeros output. You can build any possible Boolean function you desire with the correct series of transistors like this.

Next you need to understand what a [Multiplexer/Demultiplexer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer) is. Essentially, it’s like a type of Boolean function where you give it an address of ones and zeros and it will pick from either a corresponding input or output bus. This is how you “select” things in a computer.

Assembly code correlates almost one-to-one with the machine instructions that gets put into a processor. Each machine instruction is a series of ones and zeros (most commonly 32 or 64 bits, this depends on the specifications of the processor). A certain number of those bits represents the “op code,” which would be your mov, ldr, add, etc. and that specific series of bits would go into one multiplexer to “select” the function that is being performed.

Each of those functions requires other information (ie add needs two values to add together and a register to store them, mov needs a source and a destination register, etc.) which would be passed as arguments. Other bits in the instruction represent those arguments, which would be either your registers or immediate values in your assembly code. Each of those strings of inputs go into a multiplexer that selects the appropriate value.

The largest section of the machine instruction is usually at the end which is the offset. This is needed when accessing data from large memory stores because your memory addresses point to large sections of data, and when you need a specific piece of the data you would specify an offset.

Your assembly then gets translated into these instructions.

For example, one step of a Load Memory Into Register instruction have an enabled control word bit that tells the Memory module to ""output"" its current value to the bus, and the Register module has its ""input"" bit enabled to read from the bus.

The way they work largely depends on what kind of architecture is being used. Different microprocessors work differently.

the ALU as it's name suggests can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction. From these two opperations we can build more complex operations such as multiplication, division, modulo. etc (see ripple adder for a basic circuit bit number addition).

 small segments of data can be saved in the registers which hold data that should be frequently accessed with less frequently accessed data going to ram then hard-drives.


going down a level these components are made of circuits such as a JK flip-flop which can store a single bit of data, D or data flip-flops, timers, and comparators. 

these in turn are made of the low level logic gates we all learned about at somepoint such as your OR's, AND''s, XOR's, etc. 

finally you get down to the transistor a simple off and on switch where several are used in the correct configuration to create the gates.

qpu9g8,hjzjih2,t3_qpu9g8,"A specific answer to your ""Who translates 'mov'"" is that all CPUs have a specific set of instructions. This is called an instruction set. Different CPUs may have different instruction sets. For example, Intel and ARM CPUs do not have the same instruction set. Therefore a compiled Assembly program may run on an Intel CPU but not on an ARM CPU. Or it may run, but yield different outputs. The instruction sets are basically a giant table of Hexadecimal numbers which correspond to a specific instruction.

But if you want to create an instruction set, you have to program the gate logic for the instructions. Gate logic is basically a series of cycles where each cycle has a set of operations for which gates and busses to open/close. Some instructions take more cycles than others to be completed depending on the CPU architecture and instruction set which is why we have concepts like ""Branchless programming"". Branchless programming is basically writing if/else logic differently to avoid switching branches in the compiled machine code since switching branches can be a heavy instruction and takes more cycles.

A good but small difference between ARM and Intel instruction sets is that an 8-bit integer is signed differently. You know the difference between unsigned and signed integers in programming. Say you have a C program where you declare a variable c:

    char c;

On an Intel CPU or most x64 CPUs, this basically compiles or is equivalent to:

    signed char c;

Since an integer is evaluated as a signed integer by default. But on ARM CPUs this compiles to:

    unsigned char c;

So you have to take that into account when you program for ARM CPUs. For example, if you compile this code below to an ARM instruction set. Based on what I mentioned earlier, what is the problem?

    char abs(char c) {
        return c < 0 ? c * -1 : c;
    }",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1636493383.0

Seeing how an adder works revealed the mystery of how circuitry can actually do math.

Then seeing how the whole circuit starts off in chaos where any parts (not good with terminology) could be on/off but once electricity has flowed through the whole circuitry it reaches an equilibrium.

And how certain parts (registers) are protected from that chaos and are updated only after that equilibrium state is reached.

>Who translates 'mov' into what it actually does and who knows how to interpret that command ? 

An assembler does this. It does what you think, it sees mov and there is a set binary sequence which corresponds to that. It just sticks that down as the next bytes of the binary file.

The CPU never sees the letters m/o/v, it is fed the first 8 bytes of the binary file. Those bytes are just put into a CPU register. The bits in those bytes set up the initial conditions of the circuitry which will come to some equilibrium. Then it automatically puts the next 8 bytes of that file into the same register (unless there was a jmp command or an interrupt etc.).

For example, the 10th bit might be connected up to a AND gate, so if that bit is a 0, the output of the AND gate will be off. That's just an example of what I mean by initial conditions affecting the circuitry.

=======

CPUs are made of billions of transistors, assembled in logic gates, assembled in more complicated circuits like the Adder, ALU, etc.

I'm sitting in front of that computer and I write a very basic program, compile it and for the sake of argument, I store it in RAM.

'storing' something in RAM means that at the lowest levels, a transistor/capacitor pair gets activated and one capacitor gets filled with current storing 1 bit (I'm guessing now ?). 

so reading something from memory must mean that an electric current arrives in the ram circuitry that says: give me the status of all capacitors in row 10

Then how would the status (full/empty) of capacitors be communicated back to the CPU and what does the CPU do with that info ? Does the CPU in turn also have transistor/capacitor pairs that get activated in order to 'work' with this information ?

Storing the length also makes it possible to reference substrings from anywhere within a larger string. With null-terminated strings, you can only reference a substring which goes until the end. For example if the string is ""HELLO WORLD"", in C (a null-terminated string language) you could refer to the substring ""WORLD"", by adding 6 to the start address, but you could not refer to the substring ""HELLO"" without modifying the data to replace the space with a null character. In Rust (another systems language, with length-based strings), you can split the string into ""HELLO"" and ""WORLD"", without modifying the ""HELLO WORLD"" string data.

Reading math literature (which this essentially is) is not like reading a novel. You frequently have to go to prior sentences to remind yourself of what something was defined as being.

What Knuth is actually saying though isn't too complex (though he certainly makes it look like it).

In the first two sentences, he's remarking on the fact that the algorithm defined previously (I'm looking in my copy of Volume One of *The Art of Computer Programming*, though mine is the second edition from 1973) as quadruple (*Q*, *I*, Omega, *f*) is not sufficiently restrictive, as it isn't necessarily *effective* (previously defined as being computable by a pen and paper in finite time).

 >Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics. Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them.
 
**[Turing machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)** 
 
 >A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete ""cells"". The machine positions its ""head"" over a cell and ""reads"" or ""scans"" the symbol there.

One of the things that makes something like that harder to hold in the mind (for the reader, as I have done this plenty as a writer and felt no shame about it until a few weeks later when trying to read what I'd written) is the use of single letter variables and Greek letters rather than words.

qoh47t,hjnafhu,t3_qoh47t,"There is a lot of literature on genetic algorithms and schema theorem. I would suggest reading Holland's original work on it.

To give you a somewhat concise answer, the basic principle is that high-quality solutions have elements (building blocks as Holland called them) that are likely to appear in other high-quality solutions. Hence, with genetic algorithm (GA), a population of high-quality solutions is maintained. Two members are selected and their building blocks (genes) are intermixed. By mainly using the building blocks from these solutions it increases the likelihood of finding a better solution than those in the population. However, since it is possible that a key building block is missing from the population and hence cannot be selected by simply intermixing (crossover), a mutation operation is added to give a chance of finding such an element.

Since GA is non-deterministic it cannot guarantee to find the globally optimal solution. However, it is guaranteed to find better solutions over time because only better solutions are preserved in the survival/culling step. The computational cost for finding a better solution generally increases over time.

Note, that GA is not optimal for all search problems and is highly parameter driven (see various papers by Grefstennete and ""No Free Lunch Theorem""). Parameter optimization is required to make it work well for even those problem spaces for which it can search effectively.

GA is ineffective when the underlying hypothesis is not true, i.e., that high-quality solutions are not composed of building blocks of other solutions.

Like, they're both tools, and they both hit things, but it's the what the tool is building that's the different.  The carpenter builds a house, the blacksmith builds more tools.  The Statistician (carpenter) is using ML build some data or interpret it.  But CS is using ML to build more or better tools.

I think as you mentioned that /r/statistics is more concerned about the interpretable models they get out using ML.  And that makes sense.  I think CS is more concerned with the algorithms to make those models.  

There's a ton of overlap, ML is like applied statistics using computer science algorithms.  But, CS tends to focus more on how to efficiently build the tools (so to say).  Which algorithms best fit the application and how to arrange the data so that it can be taught to the model. When working with ML there's more focus on the kinds of regressions, variance and bias from some given training set vs the test sets.  The overall goal in CS ML is to find ways to get the best resolution of the data while limiting the BigO time it takes to do it.

For instance.  A statistician doesn't really need to care too much about how long it takes for an ML to process a model.  If they're just analyzing numbers of some huge data set about global wind trends, or aggregate user data and viewership trends.  There's no pressing need that the ML be able to instantly pop out a prediction in miliseconds given some new input, just that whatever answer it arrives at is correct.  CS will say, okay, it's correct, but now my autodriving car just crashed because it wasn't able to quickly make that prediction.  So CS will want to know, ""how can I get as accurate of a model as I can, that can process a new input as quick as I can?"".

Software engineering (SWE) is an application of those skills listed above, some more than others maybe, to build systems that accomplish some goal for a product or project. Being more well versed in CS is the same thing as being better at SWE. CS is the foundation of good, scalable, fast software.

Computer engineering is a non standard term, and to me is a bit ambiguous as to if you’re talking about systems engineering which I think requires some Electrical Engineering coursework as well, or just SWE which is what your question seems to hint.

qna9yb,hjfd8ph,t3_qna9yb,"Your question makes little sense. What is precisely the context between computer science versus computer engineering?

If you are referring to a degree program, than the answer is obvious. A degree is named based on the course content and syllabus, not on the eventual career outcome of people receiving education under that program.

Majority of people who receive any degree at undergraduate level and masters level, and even significant number of people who go all the way to Phd level ( or any equivalent qualification) will not have a career as a researcher in that field or equivalent position that requires the epitome of specialization in that field. Therefore, select few physics major become physicist; select few creative writing majors become full time authors of creative literature; select few business majors go on to become a CEO ; and you can expand this argument to many other fields.

So, a computer science is called that because the university offering it believe that the courses and syllabus fall under the field. And, it is common for colleges to differentiate between a computer science and computer engineering course. At my school these are two different majors despite considerable overlap, and at most school the same applies.

If you are referring to how the term CS is used in casual conversation — e.g CS pays well— there can be some semantic ambiguity which by the pragmatics of the language it is very clear anyway. For the very example I have cited, it is clear that speaker is making a comment on specific subset of the field, rather than a statement on the field in its entirety.

Sure, I don’t see why not. *Should* you build a language in Python? No, probably not. People have built OSes in high-level languages though: https://node-os.com/ https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano

And probably plenty more. 

What language *should* you use today? I’d say Rust. The Linux kernel is obviously written by incredibly smart people, but programmers make mistakes. Google has a project to identify bugs in the Linux Kernel and found that over 70% of them are memory issues or data races. Mozilla, Microsoft, and many other companies have said the same things about their C/C++ code bases. However, these issues are, by design, impossible in Rust. Rust’s unique ownership model makes data races impossible and allows it to properly free your memory without the need for programmers to do it manually like in C/C++ *and* without the use of a garbage collector like all high level languages. And Rust is just as fast as C/C++ and sometimes faster, while still being a higher level language.

qmuxrz,hjcgi7w,t3_qmuxrz,"> Like is the instruction of if (x==2) then print(x) the same machine language for C and python?

Answering the question directly, no.

Python compiles down to its own byte code that is unique to python.

Java compiles down to byte code for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The JVM hosts other languages as well such as Clojure.

C compiles down to _whatever instructions set you want_. That might be x86, that might be x86_64, that might be 6502 or ESP8266.

Compilation just translates the code from one language to another, usually simpler, language. Usually down to some machine-readable code, either a virtual machine (NOT like VMWare) or physical machine code. Physical machine code is interpreted by physical hardware rather than software (we must get this low level at some point) and depends on the exact machine you're running the code on. So C doesn't even have to compile to the same code/instruction set as C.

Finally, the `print(x)` actually must ask the OS to do the printing for you. So in the case of the example code, if you  compile the code for an intel mac, and a windows PC, or a Linux PC, you'll use the same instruction set, but it will result in different code as the code will talk to the OS in different ways.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1636066914.0

To answer your direct question the `if (x == 2)` might to produce the same machine code. Basically a `cmp` and a jump instruction (`jne` maybe). 

`print(x)` would be pretty different between languages (not just the keyword / function name itself) due to string interpolation, formatting, buffering, flushing, etc. There's a lot that goes into printing stuff out.

For your most specific question (regarding C++ and C), **if** the same compiler is used and **if** the basically the same source code is used, then it _might_ be the same machine code. Though C++ `std::cout << x` likely produces different machine code than C `printf`.

If an ACK/NAK is corrupt, the sender needs to resend the package to the receiver to get another ACK/NAK that isn’t corrupt. If the receiver has already received the previous package, when it is resent by the sender it’ll be a duplicate package, so we need a way for the receiver to know whether the package sent most recently is the previously received package or a new one. The single bit (sequence number) you refer is used by the receiver to check whether the received package is a duplicate or a new package. 

This bit is updated in the receiver end after sending an ACK, so for example say it’s set currently at 0, it receives a package with bit 0 from sender, sends an ACK back, now bit is update to 1. Let’s say that ACK was corrupted so the sender resends package with bit 0. Since the current sequence number in the receiver end is 1 and 0 != 1 the receiver knows this isn’t the expected package so it must be the previous package and it resends the ACK for bit 0 (when you resend an ACK from a previous package you don’t update the sequence number)

Tl;dr:
We aren't doing work equal to Σlog(i) but rather Σlog(n/i). This causes O(n) instead of O(n*log(n)). I provide a proof below showing it is O(n) without Stirling's formula.

Proof:
Σlog(i) for each i is wrong because we aren't doing log(i) units of work for each i. That would be how many times we can double 1 without exceeding i; However, in the function the units of work are based on how many times can we double i without exceeding n. These equations model this value (where x is the number of times we can double i to equal n).

`i*2^x=n ⟹ 2^x=n/i ⟹ x=log(n/i)`

To model the entire function we sum each iteration:

`Σlog(n/i)`

`= log(n/1) + log(n/2) + ... + log(n/n)`

`= n*log(n) - (log(1) + log(2) + ... + log(n))`

`= n*log(n)-log(n!)`

The proof that n\*log(n)-log(n!)∈O(n) can be done by induction (after spending too much time on it and hating yourself).

`Let g(n) = n*log(n)-log(n!)`

`Let h(n) = 2*n`

Claim to be proven:

`P(n): g(n) < h(n) is true for all integers n >= 2`

Base Case:

`P(2): 2*log(2)-log(2!) < 2*2 ⟹ 1 < 4 ⟹ P(2)=True`

Induction Step:

Let's define a function that represents the increase of g(n) to g(n+1). That is, we will define function gΔ(n) be the difference between g(n+1) and g(n).

`Let g(n) = n*log(n)-(log(n!))`

`Let g(n+1) = (n+1)log(n+1)-log((n+1)*n!)`

I did this bit by hand to be sure, but [wolfram alpha can confirm](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28n%2B1%29log_2%28n%2B1%29-log_2%28%28n%2B1%29*n%21%29-%28n*log_2%28n%29-%28log_2%28n%21%29%29%29) the following (assuming n is positive, which it must be as we only increase from the base case of 2):

`gΔ(n) = g(n+1) - g(n) = n*log(1+1/n)`

Doing the same for h(n) is trivial (it always increases by two):

`hΔ(n) = h(n+1) - h(n) = 2(n + 1) - 2n = 2`

The limit of gΔ(n) [turns out to be 1/ln(2)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit+of+n*log_2%281%2B1%2Fn%29+as+n+approaches+infinity) as n approaches infinity, which implies gΔ(n) never exceeds 1/ln(2). Note 1/ln(2) < 2. Now we know if P(n) is true, P(n+1) must also be true because h(n) to h(n+1) is an increase by 2, while g(n) to g(n+1) cannot increase by more than 1/ln(2). It follows:
`P(n)=True ⟹ g(n) < h(n) ⟹ g(n) + n*log(1+1/n) < h(n) + 2 ⟹ g(n+1) < h(n+1) ⟹ P(n+1)`

P(n) ⟹ P(n+1) for all integers n>=2, which proves:

`g(n) = n*log(n)-(log(n!)) ∈ O(n)`

The following example code is written in Kotlin and uses some experimental features which were suggested by my IDE, but this stuff translates to Python and any other language you are using:

    import kotlin.time.Duration
    import kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime
    import kotlin.time.measureTime

    @OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)
    fun main() {
        // For testing this kind of thing, a custom Result class is handy. We're going to use a list of them:
        val results = mutableListOf<Result>()

        // We're going to do 9 iterations, which should cover up to around a billion:
        val numTests = 9

        // We're going to start with 10 and increase by a factor of 10 every test:
        var nLimit = 10
        repeat (numTests) {
            results.add(
                f(1..nLimit)
            )
            nLimit *= 10
        }

        // We'll cap it off by checking each result:
        results.forEach {
            println(it)
        }

        /*
            Conclusion: Although the amount of time used is vanishingly small and will vary from test to test, the
                trend is clear when you view the number of iterations in the inner loop. As n increases by a factor of
                ten, the number of inner iterations also increases by about a factor of about 10.
                This is experimentally true, which makes it about 0(n) in my amateur opinion.

            Result(n=10, time=4.927005ms, innerIterations=16)
            Result(n=100, time=56.142us, innerIterations=194)
            Result(n=1000, time=488.659us, innerIterations=1990)
            Result(n=10000, time=3.690477ms, innerIterations=19990)
            Result(n=100000, time=5.846741ms, innerIterations=199988)
            Result(n=1000000, time=10.475195ms, innerIterations=1999986)
            Result(n=10000000, time=24.845879ms, innerIterations=19999984)
            Result(n=100000000, time=237.521900ms, innerIterations=199999979)
            Result(n=1000000000, time=2.323592679s, innerIterations=1999999977)
         */
    }

    @OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)
    data class Result(
        val n: Int,
        val time: Duration,
        val innerIterations: Int,

    fun f(n: IntRange): Result {
        if (n.first == 0)

        var innerIterations = 0

qkkwwt,hj0xdci,t1_hj0uezp,U can think of it as running in log n but then u have to consider it goes log(n)+ log(n/2)+log(n/4)… in which case u end up with total of n anyways. It’s simpler to just consider the highest order being o(n) because we still gotta iterate through n times. So focusing on highest fact that we need minimum of n iterations will leave u with O(n). Technically it’s be correct to add up all the logs but it’s the same result as just considering the main for loop.

Tom Scott has a [really good series called ""The Basics""](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLLeET0dOWaKHkAlPsrkcha) which teaches general concepts to keep in mind.

I hope you've heard of [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt), which has amazing science videos. (I'd check them out, even though they're not strictly math or computer science)

[Junferno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRb6Mw3fJ6OFzp-cB9X29aA) covers random computer science related subjects with a healthy dose of deadpan humor. You might enjoy [this video](https://youtu.be/MBQvN03i4-4).

[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) has a great series called 100 seconds of code, where he goes through basic concepts quickly. Take a look through [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN) to see if any of the topics are interesting to you.

[AlphaPhoenix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCWeRTgd79JL0ilH0ZywSJA) is a great channel about science, and computer science. [I liked this video](https://youtu.be/TOpBcfbAgPg).

[HoneyPot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsUalyRg43M8D60mtHe6YcA) produces pretty good documentaries for developers.

[Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/c/KárolyZsolnai) covers real world math papers in a fun and entertaining way. A lot of his videos relate to AI.

[Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) has some amazing videos about game development, which often involve more math than you think. I particularly recommend his [coding adventure series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK).

[freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) has a pretty good youtube channel that does a lot of deep dives into particular subjects.

[Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) has really good videos about low-level computing. If you are interested in learning about how computers *really* work, this is a good channel for you.

[LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow) has some amazing educational videos about cybersecurity, for more intermediate audiences. He's not directly related to Math, but his content is so good I can't not mention it for people interested in cybersecurity.

I hope that helps!

Obviously, if you are experienced and you know how to code, then using Python is great because you can use all those tools that the language gives you but if you are starting out new, I don't recommend starting from Python because it's not a language that forces you to think.

If you are starting from Python and you are a beginner, then learn about computer memory as well. Mainly about how main memory works and how different kinds of data are stored, the stack and the heap.

Say if you start learning C and you are a total beginner, then the learning curve is very high, there is a lot to learn; not just about the language but you will also learn about how memory works. However, you will get better in problem solving when using a language like C since there aren't a lot of tools/libraries/shortcuts that C gives you to solve problems. So, it forces you to build those tools in a way, which definitely improves your critical thinking.

So, here is my advice. If you are not sure whether to learn coding or not, try Python first. Learn a bit of Python and see if it interests you. If you are really serious about coding and you want to be a good at problem solving, then learn either C/C++ or Java.

qjz6f7,hitzm0f,t1_hitqchc,"I agree and that is what I said as well; Python is the way to go if you have no clue what programming/coding is and you simply want to see if it is for you.

And yes, you can definitely make a lot of progress by understanding about the basics of programming such as loops/conditional statements/functions/classes/recursion and so on.

But when comparing to languages such as C/C++/Java, Python is not a language that forces you to understand why something works and how something works. Knowing how and why things works can significantly help you to write better code and also to think like a computer.

For example, in Python I can swap two variables like so:

    x, y = 1, 2

The above is very intuitive. x = 1 and y = 2. This is very easy for a beginner to understand but does he/she understand what is ""actually"" happening? This only teaches the beginner how to code but doesn't teach how to problem solve at all.

Now, let's try the same in C:

    int x; int y; int hold_x_for_me;
    hold_x_for_me = x; 
    x = y; 
    y = hold_x_for_me;

The above gives, x = 1 and y = 2. I know, you can do the same with Python but it's very easy to fall into the trap of using the shortcut because it's much easier to understand and because it doesn't force the beginner to learn why it works.

The above is a bit more complex for a beginner but now the beginner can at least try to understand why the hold\_x\_for\_me is needed. It forces he/she to think why this extra variable is needed.

It allows beginners to start thinking about computer memory, how data is stored, what variables really are (an abstraction to memory address) and these are very important concepts to learn when learning how to code as well. Because by learning such concepts, beginners tend to develop/improve their critical thinking and also improve to think more logically, which is what you need when coding.

As you can see, C has types as well and thus when declaring variables, the correct type must be used. This again forces beginners to learn about how different kinds of data are stored, which is again another important topic. But when using Python, it's very easy to just brush it off.

BUT, you can still learn Python and also learn all the other important concepts I mentioned above. When I learned Python at Uni, we did also learn about how things and why things worked (what happens under the hood) and so it was very useful to learn with Python.

So, if you are a self learner/in the path of self teaching, then make sure you learn what happens under the hood as well (computer memory, namespaces, scoping, data types, how things are stored) if you are going to learn Python.

Even if you do choose to learn C/C++/Java, you may learn what happens under the hood as well depending on how great the resource (book/video) is and so definitely do your research as well.

I will name few important concepts any beginner should be learning when learning how to code:

You can not compare a course with around 10-15h or content worth 15$ to an collage class which has hundreds of hours (if you include studying for exams and homework) and which you pay thousand of dollars for.
Most courses are not meant to be a “learn all about this theme that exists in detail” they are more like another resource you can use to learn about the topic you are studying and in my opinion they are way more efficient if you want to study something, by the facts that these are people who scripted the video content they deliver and they try not to waste time (which is very different from schools and colleges (this is what i experienced)).
I also enjoy the fact that you can replay, change the playback speed and choose when you are studying, this gives me the opportunity to manage my schedule better and gets me generally more motivated.

Did you even read what I wrote? Do you understand computer architecture? How do you access memory when you code? It's addressed as a big one dimensional array. A memory address is just an index in to that array and tells you where data is stored. A linked list isn't some magical beast that lives outside of memory, it's implemented on top of memory. That big array. I was trying to make a point that every data structure is an abstraction of other data structures, though you seem to have missed that point, so perhaps I didn't do a very good job communicating it.

As someone who interviews software developers on a regular basis, I can tell you that I'd be impressed if someone actually talked about how data structures like linked lists were actually stored in memory. It would clue me in that they actually understand the underlying mechanism they are writing abstractions over. This is sadly lacking in many of today's software developers.

\> An array is usually stored contiguous in memory, not the integers.

I'm honestly unable to understand what point you're trying to make here. Yes, an array is not stored in ""the integers"" because that sentence doesn't even make any sense. If you're referring to my statement ""individual data primitives addressed with contiguous integers"", did you perhaps misunderstand? I can speculate on why you said what you said, but honestly I don't know, so I won't.

\> A linked list is usually not contiguous in memory since it traditionally needs to allow for constant time insertion and removal.

I'm not sure why you felt to need to point this out. I never said a linked list was stored in contiguous memory. I did talk about a ""list"", referring to one of your comments to GeronimoHero, but a ""list"" is not the same data structure as a ""linked list"".

A good programmer builds useful programs that have a low count of lurking bugs, handle bad inputs gracefully, are easy to read and maintain, are easy to install/deploy, meet customer requirements, give clear error messages, have a clear version history... Those are essential skills for a programmer that are largely unrelated to the language you're working in.

When I'm hiring, I'm much more interested in someone convincing me they have those skills than that they've worked in language X for 5 years. If someone clearly has those non-language skills, I'm prepared to hire them with no experience in the relevant language at all, on the assumption that they'll pick it up quickly enough that it won't be an issue. Just asking someone to demonstrate having worked on a project in language X for Y time I view as very risky - it's surprisingly easy to bullshit your way into a junior role in a big organisation and then look busy while never actually achieving anything. You can get away with this for a long time.

A couple of years ago, there was a guy contracting at one of the companies I work with. He was hired because he appeared to have solid Go experience on his CV. When he arrived, it pretty quickly became obvious that he could sort of talk the talk and had seen people working in Go, but had never actually written anything useful. As soon as you started asking detailed questions, his bullshit turned to defensive bluster. As soon as you asked him to write some code, nothing happened. If you really pressed him to produce something, he would deliver something cobbled together from StackOverflow examples that didn't really address the requirement and was nearly up to the code standard you'd expect for a five minute demonstration that something was possible. Usually it involved some wildly inappropriate technology choice, because that's what the examples he found used and he didn't know how to adapt them (trying to replace sqlite with Elastic on an embedded system already struggling for memory is an example that sticks in the mind - he didn't understand why we wouldn't listen to his amazing ideas). Error handling, when it happened at all, consisted of `panic()`.

He was bagging £400 per day and as far as he was concerned, he'd made it. He had no awareness that a problem existed and no interest in improving - as far as he was concerned, everyone else was the problem. His contract still got extended three times and it was only after two years that we managed to convince HR that his contributions were entirely negative and to stop extending.

Six months later, his recruitment agent told me he'd spent the profits from his two years on a three month holiday in Croatia, then moved to London and used his experience with us to bag a gig paying nearly double what he'd earned with us.

Indeed, there is a lot of cross pollination - you’ll notice this with the vendors competing for your workflows.

It’s because at some point in the past, the financiers and engineers are mega large corporations realized that the future was in a “platform”: a way that arbitrary improvements and extensions could be hooked onto an underlying system. I began to understand this through Microsoft Services in my work.

There’s a platform, which runs plug-ins, or services, which are small pieces of functionality that complete a specific task. A collection of these and their behavior + our interface with them is a “program”

So why does that matter? Simple. If I have a great platform that people almost *have* to build on for whatever reason, I essentially own a piece of every plugin that runs on it. I become the gatekeeper.

If I have the requisite skills on my teams I can build my own features, or copy what’s out there to keep up with the joneses.

If I have enough cash I can just buy the plugins that are most successful. Look at Apple and JAMF for a recent example.

The consequences of the apple epic ruling also come to light.

For most purposes that an operating system would have been made from scratch twenty years ago or even forty years ago, Linux either fits the bill very well, or is good enough. 

Though keep in mind that in the few places you still some regular OS development, though as hardware gets more and more powerful, it become less worth the trouble. The two ends of the spectrum if you will, HPC and embedded. 20 years ago there were generally using OSs there either developed for that kind of system or even running a custom OS. Using Linux in either place makes development of software and systems insanely easier, and the only reason that Linux wasn't used before was it was too slow or had too much overhead. Nowadays, to the degree that overhead is still there, just throwing some more hardware at the problem fixes. 

In terms of advances, so much of it happens behind the scenes. The Linux kernel of today does think that weren't invented yet in the 90s. As long as the interface between userspace and the kernel stay the same, the kernel can be radically changed, and it has. One thing that effectively future proofed a lot things was the assumption that a lot of processes/threads were logically, if not actually, running at the same time. Doing so provide a huge amount of flexibility, even back when only servers and high-end systems had more than one cpu/core. This abstraction made going from systems with 1-2 cores to systems with 10-20 cores possible. It takes a lot of stuff to make that performant, but again it's all under the hood, hidden from the user, and from userspace developers.

Same thing in terms compilers, language implementation, and runtimes. Programming languages have changed a lot in the last 20-30 years, the best being  the only real software was written in C or C++, period. There were exceptions of course, but outside of very specific domains, there wasn't really a choice. There were a number of scripting languages  that people used, many  Perl (and PHP if you want to think about it at all), which traded a lot of performance and/or safety for ease of use. The web wasn't doing anything like it does today, so scripting languages were generally good enough.

Selfish motives aside, a strong and vibrant culture of open source software development and free computing increases tech and math literacy while growing the traditional pool of people from which innovation occurs. I think it is clear that neither fully proprietary nor fully free points of view will prevail, because nature likes a good idea and widespread literacy, invention, and technological agency without limits is a very good idea. I personally get a kick out of the corporate fondness for open source software as a perfect example of selfishness breeding something universally pretty good. The very people doing the extending and embracing are often responsible for propagating ideas farther and wider than the hardliners ever would have on their own, by their own ideology, even as such hardliners and ""never corp"" types keep the other side from getting too carried away. Like all ideological concerns, it is a funny little spectrum with important details that get obscured by the level of rhetoric involved (which creates the gang warfare mentality so common in all ideological concerns). 

In short: I am pretty happy that big companies find it in their interest to support free software, while I am equally happy that there are people so extreme about it that the concept is fairly safe from total co-option. This is a thing that is good for generational tech literacy, and even national security when you extrapolate from that.

Instead jumping into coding (why on earth are people still doing that, I have absolutely no idea) first you need to gain insight and understanding. To understand, you need to remove the unnecessary parts, and start to make an abstraction of the problem. In computer science, we have plenty of such abstractions, including: concept modeling, process modeling, state machines, graph theory, physical models (F=m\*a is also a model), petri nets,  etc. What we want to do is in order to solve the problem, we transform it into one (or multiple) of well known abstraction, because for those abstractions we have a huge amount of tools.  


Imagine a case when you need to develop a software which calculates traveling times from cities to cities. This problem can be abstracted to a graph theory problem: finding shortest paths. Imagine a case when you need to write a calculator with different modes. Dang, this is actually a state machine. Imagine there are lots of various nouns in a long description where you are absolutely lost (like we were when we had to create a document for an audit). Then you you concept modeling when you model the various concepts and the connections between them. Or you need to understand a process and people ask you what if there are too many customers standing in the line, how will our system react to it? Then you have a way to describe it (like activity diagram, or bpmn, etc.), or transform it to some kind of markov chain and give insights. 

The best part is that if you have an abstraction, a model, you can reason for or against it, you can even simulate how the system will work without the need of building it.

I recall that one algorithm has a worst-case time complexity that is quadratic. The thing is, it's provable that in the parsing algorithm, you can never hit the worst case scenario. Or if you know something about your data, you might be able to pick an algorithm that has a specific complexity just for that.  Quick sort has a good average time complexity, but something more specific might be better.

And algorithmic complexity is only there to tell you the ""shape"" of the algorithm. Two algorithms that are both O( n^2 ) might have vastly different running times. Bubble sort is n^2, yet if your data set is small enough to fit in a single cache line, it literally doesn't matter what other algorithm you use, because you'll always be IO bound on the memory bus. A better algorithm, you'll still be waiting for a cache read or write. A constant time complexity is usually the goal, because the time requirements are understood perfectly, but if a bubble sort takes 2 hours to run for a given data set, that's still better than a given constant time algorithm that takes 3 years.

Good depends on your usage case. Time and space complexity are asymptotic and have to do with the performance of algorithms especially when dealing with inputs of very large size or when you're doing an operation many, many times. For example, quicksort and mergesort are similar if we just look at the time complexities, but depending on the data we're dealing with, quicksort or mergesort could be faster than the other. On the data structures side, we can also see that a hash table implemented using linear/quadratic probing (to account for collisions) versus one using chaining can be better, despite them having similar performance characteristics -- and this is because, on the machine level, a hash table using probing can take advantage of caching to be faster. So there are many things to be considered when working with algorithms, like the kind of inputs you'll be feeding them (consider more than just their size) and the machine that you're working with.

There's also more complicated stuff to consider when you're dealing with amortized algorithms and datastructures, which (overall) can be efficient, but in certain cases can experience slowdowns that might be a negative (i.e. real-time systems with hard deadlines, I believe).",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1635212179.0

 >In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes. In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.

Sedgewick is the classic foundation. Knuth if you are doing real computer science rather than software development. But then there are a bunch of different ways to go from there - parallel computing algorithms, distributed computing algorithms, database specialised algorithms, data processing algorithms, various algorithms that prioritise certain things that are *not* cpu processing time (memory, reliability, security, network utilisation, power consumption).

qe1vmc,hhs67d4,t3_qe1vmc,"**AI** isn't really a strictly defined field, and the word can mean lots of things. Generally, though, it means software or systems that behave in a way that looks like it would require some kind of intelligence. This could mean a software system or a robot that's able to adapt to its environment rather than just following strict and narrow predefined patterns. It could mean something that mimics human behaviour; for example bots in multiplayer games are meant to do this, along with hopefully playing the game well enough. Software that performs a task which would appear to require intelligence or expertise if the task were performed by a human could be considered AI. This could be for example finding signs of disease or injury in medical images.

You could write at least an entire book chapter on what AI means. At its broadest, though, AI can mean any kind of an artificial system that behaves in a way that you could, by some stretch of imagination, call ""intelligent"".

Intelligent (or at least intelligent-looking) behaviour can be achieved using different kinds of techniques. Although AI is often used nearly synonymously with machine learning nowadays, AI is not really any single technique or even field of techniques. It literally just means something human-made (practically software) that acts as though it possessed some kind of intelligence, regardless of how that's technically achieved.

**Machine learning** studies algorithms that infer some kind of knowledge or behaviour based on examples it has been given. A classic example would be an image classifier: you feed the algorithm images that contain pedestrians (for example), along with the information that the images contain them. You also feed it negative examples, or images that don't contain pedestrians. The algorithm *learns* some kind of a model about which kinds of images contain pedestrians and which don't. After training the classifier with the samples, you can then feed it new images and it will hopefully be able to automatically tell whether a new image it's given has a pedestrian in it or not.

That's just an example, and there are other kinds of machine learning as well. The general gist is that ML is about algorithms that can automatically ""learn"" something from examples the algorithm has been given.

There are lots of different algorithms and techniques that can be used for machine learning. Some of those algorithms are more suitable for some tasks while others work better in other tasks. All of ML is essentially computational statistics, though: you feed some data into a machine learning algorithm, and the algorithm infers some kinds of patterns from the data. Some ML algorithms are obviously just statistics and probability math being done on a computer, while others seem more like some kind of magic that just happens to work for some reason.

One class of techniques that can be used in machine learning are artificial neural networks (ANN). The inspiration for them originally came from trying to mimic (a really simplified) idea of how human or animal neurons and brains were assumed to work. (In reality, ANNs don't actually resemble real brains that much.)

Without going into details, **deep learning** is just machine learning done with artificial neural networks that are larger (or ""deeper"") than the simpler networks that had been previously used. ""Deep"" ANNs are quite flexible in terms of what they can be trained for, and they can perform well in many tasks if they're trained with enough example data. However, they also require a lot of computational resources. Other, more traditional machine learning algorithms can be trained with much less processing power.

The connection between ML and AI is that ML is one of the most common techniques used for building ""intelligent"" systems. Automatically learning from examples is obviously useful for building software that can behave ""intelligently"". ML as a field arose from research into artificial intelligence, although many other kinds of techniques were also still used for trying to build intelligent systems at the time.

**Data science** is really just an umbrella term for all kinds of statistics, data analysis, and machine learning type things that are done computationally.

Specifically, you are not yet fluent in the language you are writing in. This feels like you know what you want to say but you don't know how to say it. 

I get this again every time I learn a new computer language. For me the only solution is to power through it. If I had a conceptual problem I could go for a walk or sleep on it and it would help. But when stuck with writers block, I just have to power through. This means just sitting at my computer writing code and googling things until I get it. This can take hours, but there really is no other way. Remember that the code is a language to tell the computer what you want it to do, and errors are the computer telling you it doesn't understand what you are saying. Think about if you were learning french. You can't really get good at it until you speak it to Someone and actually realize how to communicate in that language. Especially if you are communicating complex topics like philosophy. It requires just as good a grasp of the philosophy as of the language. 

Some tips:

- Break things down into smaller steps. 

- Write psuedo code. Start with plain English your mama would understand and gradually modify and expand that to be closer to the language and what the computer needs to do. 

- Try every idea you get, even if you think it won't work. Maybe you will get a better understanding of why it doesn't work and it will open new paths. 

- be curious. Learn how everything in the language works exactly. Read a couple blogs on every concept! And 

- don't copy any code. It's ok to find the code you need somewhere, but until you are fluent, rewrite EVERY code snippet you use. The motor memory helps in amazing ways.

By doing this, you’ll expose yourself to implementations of algorithms that you aren’t yet able to implement from scratch, but by repeatedly using them you’ll train your mind to think in those abstractions - variations of trees, maps, tries, graphs, etc. - and soon you’ll find yourself combining them, tweaking them, and eventually reimplementing them from scratch.

As for the initialization, the load signal indicates to replace the state of S. In other words, initialize S.

qcxk48,hhj6h8b,t1_hhj0wvn,"This is absolutely right, I'll add some additional details and other good reasons not to.

The easiest answer is as /u/Zepb said: Spinning hard disks are so incredibly slow (humans are bad at orders of magnitude, but we're talking 100000x slower than DRAM). You can easily run a full blow neural net in the time it takes to read one byte from a disk. Talking to a server on the other side of the country is only about 20x slower than reading one byte from a disk. It would be pointless to try and read that from disk every cycle.

That being said, not all storage is that slow. Some non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are getting fast enough that it's not totally insane to think about treating them like memories (e.g. only 10x slower than DRAM). In this case, some people are looking at addressing storage (info stays put if you turn it off) like main memory. When you have caches and stuff, it's actually plausible. The problem then becomes how you make sense of the information you stored. If my program crashes half way through, how do I make sense of the information it's already written? If two processes are reading/writing to the storage, how do we coordinate (particularly if we want everything to continue making sense later)? These are very tricky issues and this technique is a very active area of research. My personal take is that then non-volatility (storage) part of NVM is frankly not that interesting. The fact that it's really big and can be turned off to save power, however, is very interesting.

Ultimately, there are always a million tradeoffs we make in software/hardware. How we write programs, how we think about storage, how these big complex systems behave and interact, this all controls what we decide to do. Markets and technology change, and there's lots of room for creative memory solutions.",7,0,0,0,7,False,False,False,1634846621.0
qcxk48,hhl2pfw,t1_hhj6h8b,"I like to add why RAM is important, besides being fast, since this is what OP want to know. RAM stands for Random Access Memory which means that every address (you can think of it as a single storage cell) can be accessed in the same amount of time. This helps to make a programm run equally fast each time it is executed, regardless of the distribution of the data in memory. A HDD is usually not considered to be a RAM since the access time depends on the position of the read-head and the position of the data on the disk. So there is a huge variation in access time.

To unblame HDDs, they are very good at storing huge amount of data and if the data is read in consecutive blocks it is pretty fast. But the advantages of HDD are only at handling large volumes of data which is not needed in programm execution.

HDDs are not exactly RAM but also not exactly not-RAM. A better example is tape memory, these are LAM Linear Access Memory. There the data is stored on a big magnetic tape like the old video-tapes. You have to scroll through the tape until you can read the data from a single position. Depending on where the data is stored it takes different amount of time to access it. To some extend a HDD has similar limitations.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1634879198.0

qcxh83,hhjayxe,t3_qcxh83,"ROM, as far as consumer computers go, is known as BIOS. This is the system that tells your computer how to startup. You can think of it kinda like the starter in your car; in that is mostly useful in the boot process (though, it does provide a lot of hardware-level functions during normal operation like turning on the fans when the CPU gets too hot). It is almost never an interesting question to ask ""how much ROM do I have"" because it's tiny (a few Kbs) and the information stored there is only useful if you are installing a new operating system or trying to manually modify your hardware operation (which, you shouldn't unless you know what you are doing). 

&#x200B;

RAM and HDD/SDDs (gonna call it ""disk"" from here on) are interesting because they are where your actual data and operating system get stored. In practice, RAM is ""Working memory"" and disk is ""long term memory"". When you start up the OS, it is on the disk, but gets copied into RAM so it can be run. Same with any program you start up; it gets copied from disk to RAM, then it starts executing in the CPU. All your devices also write essentially directly to RAM as well. Your keyboard, mouse, USB drive, network card, etc all dump data into RAM (well, it is a little more complicated than that, but it's true enough).  The reason you have to load it from Disk to RAM is partly because disk is so far, Partly because disks are cheaper and therfore store more information, and partly that the CPU would be waiting too long. But the most important reason is that RAM is erased when you turn off your computer/phone, but Disks are not.  

&#x200B;

So finally, to answer your question, disks are slow, large, persistent storage. They don't count as RAM because they are so slow that you have to copy from them to RAM to even do anything with it. The 32/64 GBs of memory in your phone might be RAM, but it is probably disk. Phones, even high end ones have around 0.5-8GB. The latest iPhone has 6GB, but hey, there might be an android phone that has 64GB of RAM: it would be strange but not impossible. So that 32/64GB in your phone is probably disk.

However, in terms of the real world and building PCs, ""RAM"" is often shorthand for the component known as ""DRAM"", which is a computer component (look at [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory) for more) that holds the working memory for a computer. The CPU will read to and write to it randomly (random here meaning freely, at will, at any point of memory).

Data types describe what a variable can contain. For example, an ""integer"" datatype can hold integers. A ""String"" data type can hold ""strings"". If you create a class called VendingMachine then a VendingMachine variable can hold instances of VendingMachines.

A data structure is an abstract scheme for organizing data. For example, a binary tree is a way to organize data into nodes, grouped into a tree structure. But this is abstract. The computer doesn't automatically know how to use a data structure. An ""array"" - colloquially speaking is a (sometimes not 100% formally defined) data structure. You're saying the data is lined up in some kind of linear, arbitrarily accessible list (the word list here is used informally).

Now the combination of those two are where things get interesting. You ""implement"" mechanisms in a programming language to use data structures. Most commonly, you can implement a class. For example in python I can write a `class SawBinaryTree` to define my own class (and data type) called ""SawBinaryTree"". I can write all the methods to store data in a binary tree format. But you could also write a ""AcreyesBinaryTree"" class to implement a binary tree data structure, maybe more efficiently than I did.

qbv5z3,hhcr2s5,t3_qbv5z3,"I've had the same problem when I started competitive programming.

The problem you are facing is something very common when you are not gifted in problem solving. But good news it can be learned. Basically you have the same issue that you may have faced in math class : I understand the math but fail when it comes to solving the exercise. 

What I did is that on websites like codeforce or hackerrank I worked only on one type of problem for instance problems using linkedlist. And even though at first i needed to check the solution to understand how to solve the problem. At some point I just knew what I had to do since you do mostly the same thing. Then i moved on different types or problems following the same method. Use previous solved problems to implement their algorithms in other problems !

I suggest to take the time to carefully read the problem, understand what outcome is required and what information are needed to solve the problem. Don't hesitate to draw the problem, too many people tend to work in their heads instead of writing stuff down to visualize the problem. In short don't go too fast ! 

Another suggestion that I would give you  is to make sure that you are not starting off with too difficult problems and that you know your programming language well ( i know it sounds dumb but i figured when i started competitive programming that my knowledge in c++ was quite bad and that even though i knew what certain functions did when i saw them in the solution my brain would just not think about using them ). 

A last recommendation that I could give you is to watch youtube videos about programming and problem solving. William lin or Erichto for instance are two youtube chanels that will help you understand some concepts ( it served me pretty well especially when it came to shorten my code and make it more simple ). Don't hesitate to ask people for help and look for documentation. Try as much as you can to solve a problem without looking for the solution. As it was said in another comment writing some code and trying to understand how to make progress towards the answer of your problem will make you improve even if you need to rely on the solution ay the end ( i say that because i used to give up pretty fast and look for the answer as soon as i faced difficulties, it's fine if you don't manage to solve a problem in 1 hour ). 

Becoming better at problem solving, algorithm etc is a long way that will require you rigorous practice. The more you code and solve problems the better you will get. Kind of like the progress it took you from learning how to code until you made your first snake game if you will. You need to persevere and keep working.The process is definitely very enjoyable and you will be proud the 1st time you will manage to solve a problem on your own (and also your coding interview skills will be very good and sharp).

qauqn2,hh63of0,t3_qauqn2,"Yes, they are equivalent. Strong Induction is stronger, as the inductive hypotheses is more general, just as you describe.

From a practical point of view, often having that extra generality is very useful. A particular CS example is when dealing with recurrence relations. Say you want to prove that  F(n) = F(n-2) + F(n-1)  is the (insert the equation for the nth Fibonacci number). Strong induction gives us both F(n-2) is the (n-2)th Fibonacci number and F(n-1) is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number. Weak Induction would only give use the F(n-1). 

Another sign that you want use strong induction, is if you want to make claims about all numbers smaller than n. A common proof technique is to select the smaller number n for a which a property holds. A good example of this the proof of prime factorization. Basically, any time where proving the induction step is based on more than just one number, you want to use Strong Induction.

qauqn2,hh6dcvp,t3_qauqn2,"What everyone else said is right.

As a possible minor benefit of strong induction, especially for a CS context: It more resembles structural induction.  Take for instance ""Consider the language formed by the formation rules: epsilon | (e) | e\*e.  Every expression has an even number of parentheses.""  You wouldn't want to waste energy indexing every word in the language with a natural number, only to find that the inductive hypothesis for a sentence indexed by n won't then help you prove the inductive claim.

Much better to approach this with structural induction:  Prove the claim for the base-case of a ""zero-complexity"" word.  In this case that just means the word ""epsilon"" with no parentheses.

Then assume S is a word formed by rule 2 or 3, and suppose that we already know that *any sentence of less complexity* (this is the part that's a lot like strong induction) has an even number of parentheses.  Either S = (e) or S = e1\*e2.  In the former case e has an even number of parentheses and so S has 2+(that many) and so S has an even number of parentheses.  In the latter case e1 and e2 each have an even number of parentheses and S has (that many)+(the other many) which is an even plus an even.  So again S has an even number of parentheses.  Therefore in all cases S has an even number of parentheses.

There it's more natural for the induction hypothesis to look like ""If something is true for all subtrees of the tree T, then it is true of T as well"".

For that sort of stuff, college courses can be hit or miss (especially at the intro level like Calculus 1 where the professor is far more likely to be following the traditional approach of presenting formal definitions and working through problems rather than approaching intuitively and then formalizing). If you take one that is a miss in that regard, look to online videos on YouTube channels like 3blue1brown where they take a more intuitive approach. It can be very helpful, especially if you’re able to contextualize those intuitive explanations with the formal definitions you will probably learn from a class.

——

As I get into my thoughts on Math required for Computer Science in general, it’s probably useful to point out where I’m coming from on it. For my undergraduate, I double majored in Computer Science and Math. I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for 3 years since then and I’m one year into my MS in Computer Science (part time).

I consider Computer Science to be a subfield of Mathematics, but the line is a bit blurred between the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering. Many people will go into a CS degree expecting to learn how to code and practical skills for developing software and be surprised by the mathematical side.

That being said, many undergraduate CS degrees, including my own degree, are catered more towards this audience and therefore teach many practical skills and focus on the theoretical concepts that are more useful in software engineering (e.g. design patterns, agile methodology, requirements analysis, software testing).

Therefore broad math knowledge ends up being really useful, but deep knowledge is only necessary for the specific field(s) of math used in whatever area(s) you dive more deeply into (i.e. beyond an introductory course in the subfield).

Some examples:

Computer graphics makes heavy use of linear algebra. I’ve played around with some low-level 3D graphics programming, and I found myself doing matrix multiplication quite frequently as I tried to make sense of the transformations I had to do to map object vertex coordinates to world space and to screen space.

If you do anything with Simulation or Game Development, in addition to the graphics stuff, you’ll need to understand basic physics, which is applied Calculus.

If you want to optimize an algorithm, you will need to do some algebra to find the asymptotic runtime of the algorithm. This can get pretty complex, especially when recursion is involved, and limits are commonly used.

Some subfields of machine learning (including deep learning) rely heavily on derivatives, but not just the kind you’ll see in Calculus I, but partial derivatives too. This is the one place in CS where I’ve used anything I learned in Calculus III.

Anything low-level or on the hardware side is going to run into Boolean Algebra. This is where the idea of CS as a subfield of Math comes in, because you’re unlikely to learn this in a Math class, but many CS programs have a course that covers it while teaching about digital circuits. Still, the field is much closer to what I learned in the math course Abstract Algebra (it covered groups, rings, and stuff like that).

Cryptography touches Boolean Algebra, Group Theory, and I think some Geometry as well. It can and will probably pull in many fields of math, if it can leverage them to create difficult one-way “trapdoor” problems. If linear algebra isn’t used there, it probably will be in the not-too-distant future.

Graph Theory comes into play in many areas of Computer Science, especially when networks are involved, but also in Parsers/Compilers.

Computer Science definitely requires math, but not necessarily the kinda of math you are used to calling math.

There’s a whole world of math we use in computer science like formal logic, finite state systems, automata, graph theory, algorithmic optimization, the list goes on. A better understanding of calculus is helpful, but not necessary for every discipline.

It’s a lot like IT, where you have a tool or approach to a problem, and as long as it “works” it’s kind of up to you the degree you wanna understand it. “It works” isn’t good enough for computer scientists, often we focus on eking out any little optimization we can because we think at scale.

As someone with an exceptionally similar background (bachelors in CS with a minor in math, and a masters in CS), I’ve always seen Computer Science as a field similar to architecture.

It’s heavily based in math, and you wouldn’t be able to work out most of the underlying features without math, but the subject itself encompasses things outside the scope of math (building actual buildings; writing code) and wouldn’t just be considered a subfield. At my company for example, I don’t think many of the employees who actually write code would say that what they do has to do with math, more than systems planning and whatnot.

If you exist in theoretical computer science, you’re correct in that it’s exceptionally similar and has a ton of overlap with pure math (complexity theory being one of those topics you mentioned). As soon as you get into practice/industry though, it becomes fairly detached from math.

Since the OP seems to be self-teaching CS, it seems a lot more likely they’d be able to pursue what they wanted without needing to delve into a ton of math (unless their goal is to do one of those math heavy things lol) like you or I had to do as part of our coursework.

Could you maybe expand and point to some of the ones you mentioned (I’d also be happy to talk through those if you wanted)? Algorithm design can be math heavy, but is really dependent on what you’re doing.

For example, I worked on some stuff for my Masters related to bounding distance calculations using an approximation that took fewer CPU instructions, where the math required *was* higher dimensional calculus, but only in the proof, not the creation.

We were using this framework to help speed up various common machine learning algorithms and in order to better tweak our work to fit those you needed to bust out some fairly complicated stuff.

> So for the architect example, if there was no such thing as an Architecture degree, but you could become an architect by getting a Physics degree, then it wouldn’t change the definition of Physics, even if a good number of Physics programs started offering electives purely about Architecture.

But architecture is significantly more than just physics, in the way CS is significantly more than math. Architecture isn’t just making a building that doesn’t fall over, it’s about art as well. If you were to kneecap architecture and lock it wholly within physics, our cityscapes would just look like someone copy and pasted the same building over and over. The portion of the field you’re dropping off in your explanation is sort of fundamental to the field, and not something you can ignore. That’s why *I* went pedantic and pointed that out.

Based on some of the other comments, the OP seems exceptionally fresh to this realm, with binary and hexadecimal bases being one of the more recent concepts they learned, so I think it’s okay to be a little less verbose with things. With how wide our field is, describing it as such to folks who are only interested in a narrow sliver of information can be a daunting turn off. Math is hard enough for a lot of folks, so if you present it as just a subset of math, and not a field which requires significantly more nuance, you run the risk of “scaring” folks away.

The Swedish word for computer science is ""datavetenskap"", so it kind of does what the original commenter said. As a bonus, it doesn't mention computers. :)

As for old English, it seems like the word ""science"" has been in the English language since the 14th or 15th century [1] and changed its scope since. I wasn't able to find an old English equivalent for the Germanic word but I didn't look very hard.

I'm a bit confused from reading various dictionary entries for the word ""science"", though. [The Wiktionary page for ""science""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/science#Usage_notes) indicates the word would also be inclusive of social and formal sciences, and computer science is certainly one of the latter.

q8w84n,hgt67ks,t3_q8w84n,"In short, the difference is somewhat a blackbox and whitebox approach. Simulation is blackbox. As long as the inputs and outputs match, the internal design can function however we like. Emulation is whitebox. We are recreating the exact logic used internally by the source device.

As an example, let's look at drawing a 5-pixel horizontal line. In a simulator, we can draw that line however we like, even using specialist hardware available on the machine running the simulation for improved performance.  
In an emulator, we need to determine the method of *how* that horizontal line should be drawn. Do we start from the left or the right? What interval is there between drawing each pixel? Is it even drawn pixel-by-pixel, or all at once? What state should the registers hold following the operation? All these have to be considered, and as another commenter mentioned, to achieve this we need to specifically define this logic in software!


For the second part, any Little Man Computer implementations are *simulators*. The reason for this isn't much of a techie one - It's simply because the LMC instruction set was designed as a teaching guide rather than stemming from actual hardware.

q8rs2z,hgrc7uv,t3_q8rs2z,"I'd say from the beginning, or at least an earlier era, but it depends on your general disposition. Computers were a lot easier to comprehend 40 years ago, whereas a modern computer is almost impossibly complex, requiring you to operate with more of an abstract model of how a computer works. Learning machine-level programming on a simpler device will help reveal the nature of computers, so to speak.

But then again, that may totally not be your thing. If you're interested in an academic approach then ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" by Abelson & Sussman is an excellent book that somehow manages to cover more or less everything, while also getting you started with the very CS-credible programming language of Scheme. The book is available for free online, in lots of different formats, if you don't want to invest in a physical copy.

If you want to achieve things quickly then look into learning Python programming. It's a language that's easy to pick up and which is very expressive (allows you to achieve a lot with relatively little code), and also very popular amongst scientists of various persuations. In traditional CS domains it's mainly made inroads in AI and machine learning.

If you are not in the US I am not sure what the equivalent of community colleges might be. These often offer 2 year degrees in many subjects.

Also, software is multi layered : a program relies on a programming langage and libraries, which themselves rely on the OS and the assembler. Each of these have to be upgraded to improve performance. One well-known issue is backward compatibility, for instance in Intel processors (then support modern instructions set as well as 30 years old ones, and everything in between). This mean that some efficiency is traded for the ability to run old programs (which slowly disappear anyway).

Finally there are readability and security. Even if compilers help to transform a readable program into an efficient one, they are not perfect. And some safety measures induce a loss in performances (one low level but somewhat recent example are the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities)

I could also add that instead of doing old things faster, we try to do new, more complex things at a reasonable speed thanks to the improvements of hardware (typically : AI)",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1634104035.0
q71mpj,hggtstx,t3_q71mpj,"Absolutely! Almost all consumer grade computation is hindered by the serial execution model used by most hardware. Even our strongest computers running our best parallelized algorithms are running on a hardware based simulation of parallelization that is emulating the design choices of a computer architecture from 1970. We know how to construct stream processing based computation hardware but the computing environment is difficult to use. It is unlikely that architectures used for general use computation changes any time soon.

Windows 11 is likely to take advantage of big-little CPU architectures like intels alder lake for example.

For a company, if they can guarantee 100 people can work on features simultaneously and the result is ""fast enough"", then there's not really a problem in their eyes. Some companies really do care about software speed but they are not selling software to normal people. 

The only way to get high speed software for ordinary things is esoteric old open-source software (programs like vim and emacs open lightning fast compared to vscode). Unfortunately, open software is, in a word, pathetic. The speed of this software comes at the cost of reliability, support, and feature range. Linux has less overhead and so software runs faster on it, but if you can't use basic programs like photoshop then the performance gains mean nothing.

As for solutions go, I think there are a couple options. Things like electron pop up because they are easy to use for web devs. There's no reason that an alternative with reasonable speed wouldn't catch on, it's just difficult to make.

And it’s hard, because it’s weird and that is Ok, it’s hard and weird to everyone and the best thing people do is accept for what it is and try to do their best.

q5ryuw,hga8bqz,t3_q5ryuw,"When it comes to password hashing, we don't want to use MD5, for a variety of reasons; primarily, MD5 is not designed for passwords.


An algorithm that is designed for passwords, however, is [bcrypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). And the neat thing about bcrypt is that it is designed with a salt in mind, which is what you're asking about. 


But first, let's talk about a few properties of hash functions, as they relate to this discussion:
1. Hash functions result in an output of a fixed size/format
2. Hash functions are deterministic, which means that every input will always result in a certain, unchanging output.


A [salt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) is random data that is input along with a password into a hash function. The need for this becomes clear when you think about it: if hash functions are deterministic, then two people with the same password will have the same hash! And this is what salts do - by adding in random data to the password before hashing it, even the same passwords will have different outputs.


So whenever you store a user's password, you generate a random salt and hash it with `bcrypt( salt, password )`. The output of bcrypt will include the value of the salt, unhashed, so you can then use that same salt when checking the password that the user enters when attempting to log in - and if both the salt and the password match, because hash functions are deterministic, you will get a matching output.


To summarize:
- MD5 should never be used for passwords
- Each password is given a random salt before being hashed, which means different users with the same passwords will have different hashes
- That salt is also stored unhashed in the database for future authentication attempts


Side note: You can also have something called a [pepper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)), which is closer to the example you gave - it's a secret but consistent value that is mixed in with both the password and the salt, though typically a sufficiently random salt and properly configured bcrypt is secure enough.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1633991761.0

Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the Subset Sum Problem converted into an optimization problem. The problem is NP-Hard, so by definition doesn’t have a *true* polynomial-time solution.

We have [an approximation algorithm](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.26.1162&rep=rep1&type=pdf), but it’s still not a true polynomial-time solution, just a “best approximation” *which is probably the correct answer*.

That person’s proposed solution (even when accounting for a solution with a leftover budget, which that doesn’t) doesn’t work for the same reason a greedy algorithm doesn’t work for the Knapsack problem. If the budget is $400k, with 3 houses priced $210k, $200k, and $195k, that commenter’s solution would greedily select the $210k house instead on the $200k and $195k homes.

> It also is not Subset-Sum since there you are allowed to

Where are you getting that? A “subset” means it has to be a set of the original inputs, which means you can’t select one of the members multiple times.

> •	⁠end up with a sum smaller than the budget, whereas Subset-Sum asks whether your subset sums to precisely a given number.

This is why I said “converted into an optimization problem”. Just in case you aren’t aware, an optimization problem is one where instead of achieving an exact goal, your algorithm attempts to optimize the solution. The definition of SSP as an optimization problem is

> “Find a subset *s*, of input set *I*, with budget *B*, that optimizes the expression sum(*s*) <= *B*

If you didn’t, check out the paper I linked, since it discusses this problem and explains how they achieve an approximation algorithm that runs in O(n log n), but is still an approximation algorithm",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1633916569.0
q5993u,hg6fq92,t1_hg6ey2j,"If I understand the linked solution correctly, given your constraints (B = 400, A = [210, 200, 195]), we would first sort A to get [195, 200, 210] and then see that the prefix [195, 200] of that list is the largest prefix with sum <= 400, and hence return length([195,200]) = 2 as the (correct!) solution.


The problem can (most likely) not be reduced to the Subset-Sum problem, as you can see when you consider the following instance:

(B = 10, A = [3,10]). The answer for this problem is 1. The answer for the largest subset-sum of A less than 10 is 9, since we choose the multiset {3,3,3}. However, we can not buy the houses [3,3,3] since we can only buy each house once.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1633916938.0

I interpreted the “sorted” to mean decreasing, since that’s normally how houses are listed, but if it was sorted increasingly, you’re correct that it gets the correct solution.

For a decreasing sort, the inputs [210, 220, 390] and budget 400 would yield a non-optimum solution with the greedy algorithm.

The purpose of the example was just to show that sorting and selecting down the line *is not* guaranteed to be an optimum solution. It *can* be, depending on what the input is, but it also fails on an infinite number of test cases.

Again, where are you getting your definition of SSP? I’ve literally never seen anyone interpret “subset” to be what you’re saying it is. In every single instance I’ve come across this problem the output subset is a strict subset of the input set. What you’re doing is something entirely different.

Btw I Mastered in Computer Science and focused on Automata Theory, Class Complexity, and Compiler Construction, so I’ll be pretty baffled if my interpretation of SSP is incorrect here.

Remember that hash is a fixed length.

So:

Imagine the hash ""SHLK""

It might output ""mypassword"" or ""gibberishPasswordThatHasTooManyLengthToBeInputted""

Another way to see it it's

10 + 30 = 40

In this case 10 + 30 is my password and 40 is the hash result

but we can get 40 from -1000000 + 1000040 right?, but it might not be a valid password due to length.

In the case of hash, it has enough combination and with the correct algorithm that makes it really hard to two input that have the same output. This might happen though see [Hash Collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision) for further reading.

Due to the possible applications of hash functions in data management and computer security (in particular, cryptographic hash functions), collision avoidance has become a fundamental topic in computer science. Collisions are unavoidable whenever members of a very large set (such as all possible person names, or all possible computer files) are mapped to a relatively short bit string.

q3dv02,hfrr60e,t3_q3dv02,"Ultimately the time comes from a crystal oscillator which is the electrical version of a tuning fork, you hit a tuning fork and it oscillates at some resonant frequency determined by its dimensions. A quartz crystal does the same when excited by a rapid change in voltage, except it gives off an analog electrical signal instead of sound waves. A feedback loop keeps it oscillating after it starts up.

The output is an analog sine wave so it’s fed to a comparator which is a circuit that outputs digital high or digital low based on the analog inputs value, this makes it into a digital square wave the processor can use.

Some oscillator circuits have an additional input for an analog voltage which can fine tune the resonant frequency up or down within some range, called voltage controlled oscillators.

It’s difficult to make crystals which oscillate at ghz frequencies because their dimensions become increasingly small. There’s transistor based oscillators which can oscillate at these frequencies however they have poor characteristics, high temperature dependence, high jitter (variability between clock pulses), high variability in frequency. The solution is a phase locked loop, this circuit is a transistor based oscillator which will lock the output frequency frequency to some rational multiple (P/Q) of the input frequency. This way you can have the nice characteristics of a crystal at the speeds of transistors. P and Q may even be dynamically adjustable as well.

If you need a very accurate frequency there’s temperature controlled crystal oscillators, which put the crystal and control circuitry inside a small box with a heater resistor and temperature sensor which keeps the insides at a constant temperature, this keeps the frequency very stable. These can also be mounted on shock absorbers to keep mechanical vibrations from influencing them. People get nutty with this and do rf/magnetic shielding and a whole host of other things to keep it stable.

Beyond that you need atomic clocks, in these you blast a certain element with microwave radiation of a roughly specific frequency, causing the electrons to move up an energy level, when they fall back down to their old energy level they will re emit microwave radiation whose frequency is almost entirely proportional to the difference in energy between those energy levels, which is very precisely known. From there you base your time scale on the frequency of this re emitted radiation, usually by locking a crystal oscillator to a fraction of this frequency via a frequency divider (binary counter with reset) and from there it’s much of the same.

I’ll also add that processors require multiple frequencies, for example while the CPU cores may be running at 4ghz, this is a difficult frequency to carry on a PCB without distortion to say a USB hub so you might also need 12mhz to talk to this USB hub, something else for communication with RAM, something else for the PCIe ports, etc, etc. You might have multiple phase locked loops to generate your various frequencies based on a single crystal. Different sections of the digital logic on the processor will be running on different frequencies, said to be in different clock domains, getting signals across clock domain boundaries requires special attention too.",80,0,0,3,80,False,False,False,1633637527.0

I don't know what exactly happens on the CPU level -- I guess that might even depend on the operating system -- but a couple of sources [1][2] seem to suggest that at least one thing that happens is that the operating system puts the waiting thread in a not-ready-to-run state, so it won't be scheduled for running on the CPU. The OS will then only place the thread back in the run queue after at least the desired amount of time has elapsed.

If that's all there is to it, there's probably nothing particularly special happening on the CPU level. That of course wouldn't guarantee that your task will resume running exactly five seconds later, so I don't know if some kinds of hardware timers might be used in some cases.

I seriously doubt any modern system implements the timing based on CPU cycles, as suggested in another comment, ~~mainly because that would seem to imply busy-waiting, and~~ because the number of cycles run by the CPU in a given amount of wall-clock time is not constant or predictable when CPU clock frequencies are automatically being scaled based on load. Something like that might have happened in some old systems, or perhaps in some very limited embedded systems, but I see no reason to believe that any PC operating system would do that.

Also, on many computers, when you connect your computer to an Internet connection, the OS will go find a time server on the network and query the time server for the current time.

q3dv02,hftg02v,t3_q3dv02,"Everyone else here is somewhat right. Your computer keeps time with a time chip often in combination with a crystal oscillator, a GPS, atomic or other universally stable time source. BUT that is NOT the CPU keeping time, CPU have separate oscillators for THEIR internal timing (clock signal at eg. 8MHz or 4Ghz) whereas a timer clock will always be at a very high but stable frequency (16-20kHz for crystals) and there is a fast, but fixed, timing chip that increments and keeps track of the current time even when your computer is off (it uses incredibly little energy compared to your CPU)

For your example however, at the very base of a modern CPU stack there is one (or multiple) PIC (programmable interrupt controller) such as the 8259 - you can find these in almost every advanced microprocessor, even many of the 8 bit ones such as the Arduino. You basically tell that PIC (this used to be an external chip) to interrupt your CPU within n seconds or when the clock mentioned above has reached a particular time. Your CPU isn’t (or shouldn’t be) polling for the current time and then compare that to a registry, as you know frequency isn’t stable enough and your CPU may be busy doing other things which will cause it to overshoot that time.

So if you say:
[code]
sleep 5; 
echo “hello future”
[/code]

What happens on the bottom is that you reprogram one of the external timers (although in modern times, there are many and they are probably on-die) to interrupt your CPU from whatever it will be doing 5s from now and then your CPU will jump to the echo instruction. THAT timer is held in sync with whatever time source, your CPU technically doesn’t know what time it is at any time.

As I said, the other way to do this (if you don’t have a PIC) would be to make the CPU jump to a routine after every few instructions or you could for example tag onto another periodic interrupt such as the screen refresh interrupt or an audio interrupt, which for a screen happens every 1/60th of a second in the US or 1/50th of a second in the EU with CRT screens, read the time from an external clock at that time, and if you are at or above the target time, execute your program.

Computers mostly don't have anything resembling ""understanding"" in the way humans do. But the relatively young field of artificial intelligence is where I'd expect to start seeing this skill. Since AI can now create art, generate human faces, voice, and even fairly intelligible conversation, I wouldn't be too surprised if they have already achieved some level of consciousness, if not something resembling self consciousness. With this will likely come concepts and understanding similar to the behaviour of human neural networks.

For a human to understand something they generally create a mental model of that thing. This could simply be visuals and sound one hallucinates in their imagination, or in the case of more abstract concepts like time, we lean heavily on narratives. We develop a kind of abstract mental model by telling a story about how the thing we understand behaves. Time falls very much in this approach since most people don't understand time as a dimension of the universe but through our experience of a sequence of events. When we visualize that sequence as having regular repeating intervals we can apply our understanding of measurement to this abstract concept of time. We basically tell and hear stories to understand.

This is where I think AI might diverge quite a bit from human understanding. Although AI can generate images like our minds do, and even hallucinates very similarly to how we do, I don't think the way we train neural networks has a strong emphasis on sequence and narrative. Our brains and AI both are pattern matching machines, but AI tends to be given very fixed static stuff to train on, like a database of billions of images in no particular order and without any story to describe their relationship except the patterns of pixels it picks up on. Whereas the training we get for our minds is always in the context of our ongoing experience of the world. Our pattern recognition is always factoring in many more dimensions than just a 2d image for instance.

Each time the OS scheduler runs due to the timer interrupt, it subtracts 1 from that countdown variable.

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software. Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications.

>	Based on previous research and our own analysis, we challenge the widespread assumption that the spying fears have already been disproved. While confirming a lack of empirical evidence, we cannot rule out the possibility of sophisticated large-scale eavesdropping attacks being successful and remaining undetected. Taking into account existing access control mechanisms, detection methods, and other technical aspects, we point out remaining vulnerabilities and research gaps.

The point of this paper isn’t to provide definitive proof of spying, but to illustrate the point that the fears are not entirely unfounded. It is entirely possible, with current technologies and methods, to secretly eavesdrop on phone users and escape detection while doing so. They do openly admit, however, the lack of any empirical proof of this occurring.

 >In computer science, a succinct data structure is a data structure which uses an amount of space that is ""close"" to the information-theoretic lower bound, but (unlike other compressed representations) still allows for efficient query operations. The concept was originally introduced by Jacobson to encode bit vectors, (unlabeled) trees, and planar graphs. Unlike general lossless data compression algorithms, succinct data structures retain the ability to use them in-place, without decompressing them first. A related notion is that of a compressed data structure, in which the size of the data structure depends upon the particular data being represented.

Modern Turing complete computers work mainly with Natural numbers (0,-1,+1,-2,+2...) and not with Real numbers . The reason for this is that computers are working mainly as **finite algorithms** so that they need a string of numbers which is finite for their calculations. In the case of Real numbers there exist infinite number after the decimal point.

So why one language treats the modulo operator as a whole(10 / -4 is the same as -10 / 4), while the other is not?

If you compare the modulo operator in Python to that of C you will see that the output is different, and its mainly depends on the utility of the language and how it was built serving its purpose. While C is high level language, there is a case where 10 / -4 will leave a remainder of 2 which is very handful for complex calculations, but in Python the same remainder will always be -2 for that\`s how Python was built by theory - treat 10 as a whole Natural number and serve the denominator so that it will not be equal to zero and leave the reminder as Natural number.

What happens is that the bottom bits (A0 or A0-A1 of the address) is never exposed externally by the CPU chip, but instead, A2-A(n) are exposed to the RAM sockets, and data is accessed externally 16-bits or 32-bits at a time.

Then internally to the CPU, the appropriate 8 bits out of the 16-bit or 32-bit word are then accessed.

This is, by the way, why some processors are faster accessing 16-bit or 32-bit chunks of memory if they are 'word aligned'. If you have a 32-bit processor with 32 external data lines, and you're accessing a 32-bit word whose last bits in the address are 00, then the processor simply loads the word in one read operation. 

But if the last bits of the address are not word-aligned: they're (say) 01 or 10, then the processor has to load two adjacent 32-bit chunks of memory in two separate memory read operations, then shift things around internally.

(Some processors use a caching scheme which makes accessing words in memory the same speed regardless of alignment as long as the word doesn't cross page boundaries--but that's beyond the scope of all this.)

Note, by the way, 8 bit bytes as the fundamental block of memory was a relatively recent convention--there are older computers which use different sizes of memory. Some earlier, older computer chips used 4-bit objects as the basic unit of memory access. And some older mainframes used other sizes--one (the Symbolics L-machine LISP machine, for example) used 36-bit objects as the basic addressable unit of memory.

In short, there is no use for calculus in programming unless you're solving calculus problems. Modern curriculums are descended from the ancient view that general problem-solving skill is obtained through the practice of certain subjects (e.g latin, mathematics), and that is why you are taking calculus today. Our universities simply don't know yet how to deal with the empirical studies showing that general problem solving ability is not developed further by study of any particular subject. This is why so many coding boot camps and coding-only universities have popped up lately.

Picture your data as a cloud of points in some space. If your data is well-behaved (near normal distribution) that cloud will look like a somewhat flattened rugby ball (ellipsoid).

That means that if you project the points on an axis colinear with the vector (your first principal axis) you get the best possible one-dimensional separation between them.

The next step is then to project the points on the hyperplane perpendicular to the first vector – effectively neglecting the distribution along the first axis. And you start anew with the dimensionality of your data having been reduced by one: the new ""best"" vector will correspond to the second greatest eigenvalue.

And so on.


Perhaps physical intuition will be more appealing to the engineer: the first eigenvector is the direction where your cloud of points has its greatest inertia, et caetera for the following ones.

I would approach it the same way you approach performance complexity to keep it consistent, that is, using the Big-O rules.

Steps:

1. Omit any multiplicative constants

2. If a factor has a higher power, ignore smaller powers

>`n^2 + n` becomes `n^2`.

3. Any exponential dominates any polynomials

>`2^n + n^2` becomes `2^n`

4. Any polynomial dominates any logarithm

>`n^2 + log(n)` becomes `n^2`

Attempted to learn a lot of different languages as fast as I could.  Boasted I could learn any programming language to fluency in 72 hours or less.  (And was right.  Still can)

But I digress.  Ultimately, 12 years old is when I actually had a good grasp of what I was doing.  And that was in the year 2000.  21 years ago.

The answer to this question will vary, but I believe you can get a good grasp of programming in a relatively short time.  Less than 5 years.  Took me around 2 to actually get it, but I still thought I had that grasp earlier, just didn't understand why I couldn't understand complicated programs.

Now take a .txt file containing a random hash, say h(x1). Create another .txt file, a ""nonce"". Compress the hash .txt file and the nonce into a .rar file x2. Then check if h(x1) = h(x2). By altering the nonce you are able to get different values for x2 and therefore also for h(x2). So you may be able to brute force it.

Rather, it just uses the public key to decrypt the signature back to a digest, and then it recomputes the digest from the header and body and compares the two.

In contrast, if the verifier is also the signer, JWTs are basically never necessary, given that you could just use a random bearer token instead and store the associated header and body in a database; they just save you a trip to the DB at the cost of losing the ability to revoke the tokens, which isn't worth it in most applications.",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1632968316.0

On the other hand, the ""staff asking algorithm"" takes a constant amount of time to find the chocolate; you don't need to spend more time in the store the larger it is (discounting that you may need to walk a larger distance to reach the chocolate. Either way it's still faster). 

The searching algorithm is asymptotically larger than the asking algorithm. This is because each time you increase the ""problem size"", it always requires at least as much of your resource (in this case time). 

Not sure if this is an acceptable explanation for five year olds, but I think I've gotten quite close.

I have no idea how to convey what a polyomially larger algorithm is without getting into some basic maths. To put it concisely, function A is polynomially larger than function B if the largest power in function A is higher by at least 1 than the largest power in B. Consider the above problem:

n - number of isles (the problem size)

t - time to search a single isle

c - time to ask the staff member (and muster up the courage to...)

Algorithm A (isle searching): takes tn time to find the chocolate in the worst case. We can write this as a polynomial: A(n) = t \* n\^1

Algorithm B (staff asking): takes c + t time to find the chocolate in the worst case. Writing this in polynomial form: B(n) = (c+t)n\^0

The largest power of n in A is 1. The largest power of n in B is 0. The largest power of n in A is larger than the largest power of n in, hence A is polynomially larger than B (in n).",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1632947136.0

pwwkmh,hejxkmg,t3_pwwkmh,"When you play a video on YouTube, your computer is just grabbing a bunch of images from the server and playing them back to you in the order they come in. It actually isn't that hard for a computer to display 60 images a second to you, no matter what resolution they're in, as long as they're already \*rendered\*. Before a video is uploaded to YouTube's servers, it's rendered by the content creator. When a video is rendered, the GPU does all the intricate math that's required for every single one of the 60 images a second - every frame - to look right when you view it. Blur effects, shading, particles, anything under the sun - your GPU will keep track of the state of each of those effects and decide how the next frame should look with respect to the previous frame.

For example, suppose a content creator wants to use an effect such as high-detail snow with motion blur. When the content creator places the effect in the video editor, they aren't just placing an overlay on the video and calling it good - the GPU needs to decide what the final image should look like for every frame. The GPU would have to take into account the locations of each snowflake, the colors of the image behind it, how the snowflake was moving in the previous frame, and a bunch of other stuff, and it has to do this for every one of the 60 images a second. It has to make decisions on how the snow falls, and in some cases take into account a physics engine to do this. Once the creator's computer has done all the math required, the video is ""rendered."" Instead of being a video file with an instruction telling the computer ""Do a snow effect at this part"", it is now a series of pre-determined images in sequence at many frames per second, and it will look the same every time.

Video games don't consist of pre-rendered videos, and this is where our GPU really shines. Many modern video games just consist of a bunch of 3D models rendered as 2D images (since a monitor can only display 2D images). In other words, to keep a decent frame rate, we cannot effectively pre-render frames, yet we need to render the video we need as soon as the frames are required, before your eye notices the time taken to render the frame (video lag). This is why computer animation for video games isn't quite as pretty as the animation used for cinema - there are limitations to the detail that a computer can render on the fly before your eye notices something is wrong.

pwwkmh,hetwzgw,t3_pwwkmh,"When playing a video at high resolution the initial concern is network. If the network can download high resolution video files then there isn't any limitations in sending or receiving data. So this could be your first road block, but isn't what you're asking. Let's say you have an extremely fast internet connection, so you can download large images. 

These images get put into a cache or buffer to be processed. When downloaded and moved to the temprorary cache this is binary data. 0's and 1's. This data has to get converted into information that will tell the computer what every single pixel on the screen is going to do. The higher the resolution the more information being sent. 

Lets break the task down to a single image. The image that will cover the screen is a 2d matrix. The data will determine at every place within the matrix what the color should be, converting the binary information into hex data that can represent the entire color wheel. After determining where everything should be placed, the info is sent to be converted into screen pixels and displayed on the screen. This process is repeated for every frame of video.

Conventionally, the gpu is much better at handling this process as the gpu can handle many concurrent processes with threads. Think of the gpu as doing the most of the calculations here. The GPU is a lower level cache. So everything the CPU determines will pass to the GPU. 

That is why having a weak CPU can create a bottleneck, and not be able to pass much information between input/output operations and the GPU that is doing the computations. 

There could also be the problem of having too powerful of a GPU compared to the CPU and the bottleneck will occur at the CPU, not allowing you to get full performance out of the GPU. 

Ideally you want to maximize the performance of both the CPU and the GPU. I am not sure exactly what your computer has, but the layout can be a significant factor in this. If you are running multiple cores in your CPU it can be slower to pass data between cores than to compute in one core for example, or send to a lower cache, and your higher level caches will handle that information.

1) Charles Petzold'- Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

Walks you through the concepts of digital logic circuits to develop rudimentary processing and decision making. What is especially good is he used 18th century telegraph technology (simple switches and electromagnets) to illustrate the various logic gates and how they can be used to create much more complex circuits. At one point, he then switches to the modern world to explain the Intel family (At least up to something like 2002) of microprocessors).

Fantastic book that walks you through exactly what is going on.

2) nand2tetris.org- not enough can be said about this. Following the book, or course, you are guided (but you have to figure out the specifics) to developing an entire 16 bit computer from a single nand gate. This is a fantastic course where you spend the 1st half on the hardware, then develop an assembler, a compiler and finally an OS. So it is TRULY the full stack. 

I view it as similar to working on old cars. While modern car engines and drive trains are incredibly complex, building and playing with early versions gives you a feel for exactly what is going on beneath the hood. This would be comparable to building the engine from scratch- as in casting the metal and creating all the parts and putting it together so that it meets specifications.

I learned an incredible amount from this course and loved it. It was challenging, but truly, writing and running software to run on a computer you built from scratch- literally!- is unlike anything you can imagine. This is the full stack of computer development. After this, the mystery disappears- and yet you can appreciate the ingenuity and genius of what we use every day in a way you never could before.

Hardware: 
Once you're done with that pick up the book on Computer Architectures by Carl Hamacher. He does a really good job of explaining the different architectures used in computers (ex. The vin Neumann and the Harvard Architecture) and gives a proper reasoning for both. You can also try your hand at learning more about a basic processor like an Intel 8085/8086 to understand how registers, ALUs and PCs work. If you really want to get your hands dirty, then Ben Eater a youtuber has put out a video on building an 8-bit computer from scratch! It's an incredible resource and he even sells prepackaged kits for the project. 

Software:
For this, I recommend you start learning C. It's one among the most important fundamental programming languages that can teach you a lot about how memory assignment, process scheduling etc. are implemented. I recommend the wonderful book ""C programming language"" written by the great Dennis Ritchie himself. The next step would be to understand how low level programs such as operating systems work. For this there are many textbooks you can refer. I personally recommend the one ""Operating Systems"" by Silberchartz. There are also many amazing resources on GitHub that are parts of college courses which allow you to implement your own tiny os!

Because it's the hot topic right now. AI is going through a resurrection with the help of new algorithms and accelerators. It's always exciting and hip when something's moving forward. It's natural to want to be part of the hype. However, one would be better if he/she thinks about the long game and plays it.

It's not bad to get specialized in any subject, let it be theoretical or practical (AI has a theory heavy side too). However, keeping an open mind and letting your knowledge cross pollinate from other subjects is good practice.

While AI and related tech is nice, useful and exciting, remember that ""*AI is just informed search*"". I don't say this to downplay what it is, but to put it to perspective.

If you intend to go down the educational path of CS, I recommend brushing up on your algebra if you're weak in math. Academic Computer Science is mostly math, and there is a lot of it.

If you want to get started with coding, start with Java because you'll be using it in college. People recommend Python as a first language because it's simple. Play with Python if you don't feel confident, but you'll have to learn Java for school anyway. Someone else can recommend coding books/tutorials because I don't have any off the top of my head. Don't fall into tutorial hell though. Finish ONE tutorial, then try to build something small on your own with just the docs for reference.

Edit:  
I spoke a little ""matter-of-fact""-ly about Java. As the replies state, C/C++ is commonly used in many CS programs, especially at the upperclassmen level. Many of the schools in my region start underclassmen with Java and then switch them to C++, so I forgot to consider that other regions do things differently.

Essentially whole programming was very much high level, however the language chosen was low level. I do not like that approach since it is something like learning to write algorithms with extra work that you do not really understand why you are doing in the first place. Thus I would argue that python would be the best language if computer architecture and similar things are not covered or even mentioned. If, however, the focus is to learn low level programming, then c/c++ are excellent of course.

I’m trying to find the pdf of my course notes for my Assembly course in college, since we had a table that literally showed all of the encodings for x86 ASM with examples of generating the bits by hand, and converting the bits back into instructions, but I think it’s on a dead hard drive :/

As a made up example, let’s use the `INC` instruction. You could have 

    INC
    INC register
    INC [memory]

Each of those `INC`s encodes with a different opcode, usually sequential, like 0xC3, 0xC4, 0xC5.

The CPU know that 0xC3 is a single byte instruction, since it corresponds to incrementing the accumulator.

0xC4 takes more space to tell the CPU what’s going on, since we need to use a byte to tell it which of the registers we’re incrementing, so

    INC rcx

may encode to `C4 02` to show it was register C (rax=00, rbx=01, rcx=02, ...).

For 0xC5, you need to store a **ton** more info, so often that would be 2-3 bytes to denote what pointers and offsets are used.

If I can find that old set of notes, I’ll link it here. Hope the quick example helped shed some light on this for you!

C is high-level language simply by definition:

  * [low-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) - a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.

The amount of abstraction provided defines how ""high-level"" a programming language is.

C falls under definition of high-level language, because there is whole lot of things you don't really need to care about when writing a C program.

Although notice the last sentence in definition of high-level: ""_The amount of abstraction provided defines how ""high-level"" a programming language is_""  
In this case, the C programming language definitely fall on the **lower** end, because it provides just enough abstraction. I call such languages **middle-level**.

I know some people argue that the terms are relative and ""_Pyhton so high, that C much low - otherwise division meaningless_"", but it's incorrect. For one, Python is more similar to C than C is to Assembly. For seconds, there are relative word which can be used: ""lower"" and ""higher"". And also terms like **middle-level** or [**VHLL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high-level_programming_language) exist.

But you also need to differentiate between low-level **language** and low-level **programming**. C is high-level language capable (or even suited) to low-level programming. Even C++ (despite having even higher level of abstraction) is capable of low-level programming. Heck, you could even try to do it in Python.  
Basically, when determining the level of language, we look how high we can reasonably go with abstractions. When level of programming how reasonably low we can go.

[Low Level Programming Languages ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)

In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. 

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. 

The terms high-level and low-level are inherently relative. Some decades ago, the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered ""high-level"", as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered ""low-level"".

>The author of this article claims that not only is C not really a low level language because it's not really very close to the hardware, but that people trying to force it to be one is the reason for the spectre and meltdown security vulnerabilities from a few years ago.

The article argues both that C is disjointed from the underlying hardware, and then later argues that the hardware is optimized for C code. This seems like a pretty braindead and low effort article. 

&#x200B;

The article asserts that spectre is only a problem because compilers optimize for ILP and that GPU parallelism is better. Then it later goes through how a C compiler optimizes for SIMD operations and why thats bad. Another room temp iq contradiction. 

&#x200B;

C is in fact, by the articles criteria, a low-level language (when it comes to certain architectures). C syntax is based on the idea that code blocks should exist and that jumping instructions are used to navigate into the code blocks that should be executed. With the exception of CMOV and some AVX512 instructions, every instruction that is predicated is a branching instruction. C syntax makes very little sense for instruction sets for GPUs, old ARM architecture, Itanium and some others. The closest thing we have to syntax to represent the underlying architecture for predication-based languages is the ternary operator that exists in many languages. 

&#x200B;

What makes a higher level language is that abstractions don't represent actual correspond to machine code. So for a python loop there is no identifiable branching instruction in any code anywhere that corresponds directly to a python if statement. There's probably like 5 that are used to decide what code is interpreted next. In C if you write an if else (that's not going to get turned into cmov) then you can probably go find the exact branch instructions that correspond to it.",-1,0,0,0,-1,False,False,False,1632376298.0

I'm not sure it's a fair comparison between C and Python since the program is so simple that it doesn't need to make use of the aspects of C that some of us would consider 'lower-level'. There's no mallocing and freeing of memory (and the dangers of heap corruptions and memory leaks that possibly follow if done incorrectly, unlike the garbage collected Python), no pointers or function pointers, no bounds checks when accessing arrays lest our program march silently into undefined behaviour, no checking of potential integer under or overflow on maths operations since we're using finite ints rather than Python's arbitrarily large big-nums, and so on. 

My feeling has always been that if we decide to put C at the high-level end of the scale, then the vast majority of programming is simply 'clumped together' at one end. The scale becomes Assembly at the low-level, then a vast gap of nothingness, then C as a high-level language, and then what? Python and other garbage-collected languages are high*er-*level languages?

He wanted people to know that there's fundamental science and math to computer science and that he wasn't just a technician hammering away at a system until it starts working but someone who deals in theories, hypotheses and proofs. 

A lot of early computer science was stuff that was very independent of computers. You can run Dijkstra's algorithm on a mechanical computer made of sluice gates and water wheels, etc. if you're motivated enough to make the contraption. Similar to how you can study astronomy without telescopes if you have super sharp eyesight. 

But today things are too intertwined between computer science and engineering for Dijkstra's analogy to fully hold. It still holds for some topics such as the theory of computation but that's the extent of it. Take cybersecurity, for example. It doesn't exist without actual digital computers and not just any digital computers but ones running modern operating systems and modern network stacks. A lot of the field has turned into the ""science of computer engineering"" as opposed to being strictly in the computer science or computer engineering realm.

pspap8,hdtepre,t1_hdtbc8e,"Sure, it's just in the mathematical definitions.

Suppose that we have two functions f and g. When we say that f is (in) O(g(n)), we are saying that there is a constant c and a natural number n\_0, such that for all n >= n\_0, f(n) <= cg(n), i.e. an upper bound.

When we say that f is (in) Omega(g(n), we are saying that there is a constant c and a natural number n\_0, such that for all n>= n\_0, f(n) >= cg(n), i.e. a lower bound.

When we say that f is (in) Theta(g(n), we're saying f(n) = cg(n) for all n >= n\_0, i.e. a tight bound or upper and lower bound are equal.

What's orthogonal to these complexity classes is the fact that some algorithms  behave differently when the input is different and some don't. For example, the best algorithms that search for the max element of an n-length list must make n-1 comparisons no matter whether the max element is in the first position, somewhere in the middle, or the last. (Of course, there are worse algorithms that solve this problem, but don't confuse that for best versus worst case for this particular algorithm.) In the best case, it makes n-1 comparisons. In the worst case it makes n-1 comparisons. We say that this algorithms is Theta(n). It's also O(n) and Omega(n). However, we can also say that it's in Omega(1), since they don't do better than constant time, i.e. constant time is a lower bound or for some n >= n\_0 f(n) >= c(1) .

In other words, let n\_0 = 1 and c = 0, then f(n) = n-1, the number of comparisons to search for the max element of an n-length list, c(1) = 0(1) = 0.  And we have, for all n >= 1, n-1 >= 0. That proves Omega(1) is a lower bound for our algorithm. We can also say that this algorithm is in O(n!), since it doesn't do worse than factorial time, i.e. factorial time is an upper bound or f(n) <= c(n!) for n >= n\_0.

Theta(n) is a tight bound, and it's generally what we're looking for.

In the other case where the input makes a difference, such as linear search for a specific element in an n-length list, the best algorithms will find the element in the first position after 1 comparison and will need n comparisons to discover that the specific element doesn't exist in the list. These are the best and worst case scenarios for the algorithm respectively. In the best case, we can say that the algorithm is (in) O(1), Theta(1), and Omega(1). But we could also say that it's (in) O(n\^2), i.e. f(n) <= cn\^2 for n >= n\_0. Feel free to do the math.

In most cases, it's pretty clear what to say about the time or space complexity of an algorithm without digging into the math. We often care about the tight bound for the worst case. But the definitions are unambiguous mathematical definitions.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1632292815.0

In C++, the compiler already parses for the left and right-shift operators `<<` and `>>` which it expects to be used to shift the bits in a variable by a certain number of positions (e.g. `printf(""%d"", 5 << 1);` outputs `10` because 5 in binary left-shifted by 1 position is 10). But C++ also allows for those same operators to be overloaded and perform a *different* function, most obviously for outputting to stdout: `cout << ""hello world"";`

The main point here is that the parser already knows that << and >> are operators of some kind, and can therefore parse them appropriately. They aren't really 'new' operators at all.

* _Inheritance_: This is taught to every student as `Dog` inherits from `Animal` and ""this models how the world works"", though in reality this often creates a convoluted mess of hierarchies. Nowadays people are generally saying ""prefer composition over inheritance"", so I guess it's not really a _pillar_ after all?

In practice I think its overused because many languages, due to a lack of features, force you through class abstractions to achieve certain mechanisms. Then as a result of keyword/concept proximity, it becomes easy for anyone to mistakenly burden a class with unnecessary object orientated properties.

For example, try writing an AST datatype in Java (without spilling it across multiple classes/files). [It ends up looking something like this.](https://github.com/viskell/viskell/tree/master/Code/src/main/java/nl/utwente/viskell/haskell/expr). Now you have 16 files worth of surface area to ensure it does a specific job only.

Another example is ad-hoc polymorphism. In C++ you end up with a lot of class machinery and someone might have the wrong idea to add irrelevant state to the abstract base class that needs managing. Once people latch onto these object orientated implementations its hard to get away from them.             

OOP isn't inherently bad but you have to keep the nuances of the language and the goal of the objects totally in mind. In a team setting this gets hard.

An experiment I suggest is try writing [algebraic datatypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) (Product types & Sum types) by hand in C. Additionally try writing a [vtable in C](https://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_OOP_in_C.pdf).

ps8py7,hdot7tk,t1_hdobbie,"My take based on the points presented:

Inheritance:

While it works well in idea it does not work well in implementation, we get weird metaphors where something like car inherits engine, when car is not engine it has a  engine. Now I know this can be resolved by clearly defining ""has a"" vs ""is a"" but many times developers conflate these ideas. It also leads to behavioral hiding where one has to walk the tree of inheritance to figure out what is manifesting a behavior.

Polymorphism:

Nothing wrong with it, it is just a take on polymorphic functions, it is not a novel concept to OO. It helps us as humans reason about function naming and signatures.

&#x200B;

Abstraction:

Abstraction is better defined as loose coupling, OO tends to perform pretty poorly at this but so does procedural and functional is only slightly better than this, to truly move away from tight coupling one has to move away from graph based data structures, but this become increasingly difficult to reason about, and necessitates the utilization of languages based on first order logic, which have historically been extremely difficult to built complete systems in. While they tend to excel at black box abstraction they are very difficult to organize sequencing logic in, to comprise comprehensive systems.

&#x200B;

Encapsulation:

The absolute worst idea ever. While it seems easy to reason about packaging data with logic has causes all kinds of one off side effects as the logic specifically depends on the data it travels with. Further it promotes unnecessary mutation of internal state, so that any external reliance of that data cannot guarantee the sequence of events that transpired internally to arrive at the current state of the data. This is really where first order logic shines as with it, you do not tell the system the semantics of the graph nor the events to transform it, rather you specify facts and rules then the system can infer relationships and outcomes.

&#x200B;

The best recommendation I can give, if one really wants to understand the tradeoffs of programming paradigms, is to learn Java, Lisp and ProLog, once you have had exposure to those three you will understand the tradeoffs each group made the achieve the goal they were looking for.

Side note, if you survive ProLog, you get some kind of merit badge. It was the one language that blew my mind, but to this day I cannot imagine the tediousness it would require to build an entire software system in ProLog.

Data oriented code will pretty much always be faster as it should generally be more memory efficient, but many people find data oriented code more difficult to follow and it can be a bit tricky to do well.
Functional programming is more elegant, and once you're familiar with it, it is in many cases just better than OOP both in legibility and performance. However, many people find it difficult to learn, and without an excellent compiler you're likely to introduce many copy operations and checks that slow down your program if you don't know what you're doing. So while it has a lot of potential, it also features a lot of room to bugger it up.
Then there's aspect orientation and all that, but let's stick to data, functional, object.

OOP is easy to learn, reasonably efficient, and not too inelegant as long as you avoid silliness like factory factories.
Unfortunately, it is likely to introduce a significant amount of boiler plate, a lot of memory waste, many indirections, etc.
There's also something to be said about object oriented ""patterns"" being complicated ways to compensate for object oriented programmers not using or not having access to features like first class functions- a common debate.
It's particularly painful to see these patterns used in a language like C++, but a lot of programmers don't learn the tools they're using.

I should have been more clear, modeling sequence based business logic is extremely difficult in first order logic. First order logic is good at accurate and predictable results like the following:

facts:

all living things breathe.

Men breath.

John is a man.

&#x200B;

where based on these facts you can say:

isAlive(John) and the response will be true.

&#x200B;

This is very hard to model, say an shopping cart where it is sequenced based:

&#x200B;

places item in cart -> checkout -> collect info -> collect payment -> produce order.

&#x200B;

But what a lot of developers don't realize is first order logic works well between every ->

This is where rules engines and workflow engines work well, as they provide fact based programming in between sequences.

&#x200B;

Let's take produce order as an example because many times it is easier to work backwards with first order logic:

We could say the facts are:

payment must be collected.

Item must be in inventory. (though this should also be performed in presenting the item as well)

Personal info must be collected.

Address must be validated.

Then we can ask:

canOrder(invoice)

The person that cracks that nut and figures out how to make sequencing intuitive in a first order logic language, will certainly make a mark on computing.

What's on the other ends of these streams? It can be anything, depending on how the process is created. But for simplicity let's say both are connected to the process that launched it, which is usually bash, aka your console.

So we call:

    printf(""hello world"")

This is a function in lib c. If you look at the source code you'll see it does the equivalent of :


    write(stdout, text)

Write is a function provided by your Linux kernel, therefore it is a syscall. So we transition to the Kernel. Inside the write function there is code to take each byte of the strong and copy it to the given stream. It does so.

The kernel knows all processes associated with the stream, and it looks for any waiting ones and wakes then up.

So bash wakes up, sees it has data on a stream it used for your processes stdout. So it reads the bytes one by one and then puts them in a text buffer.

It then runs more. code to convert those bytes into visible glyphes on your screen.

It then calls another syscall telling the kernel to update the frame buffer at the relevant position.

This has the overall result of ""hello world"" being visible on your screen

prunhv,hdmjx76,t3_prunhv,"All of this depends on the operating system.

----

At the very *very* bottom of the stack is the hardware: the physical devices that comprise the computer screen, the keyboard and the like. The video card hardware which drives the display on your computer monitor, which is controlled through a device driver that knows what signals to send to that hardware to cause it to do things.

So, in the x86_64 architecture you may have a video card that, in a special start-up text mode, displays text on the display by specialized hardware that converts ASCII characters in a buffer of memory into video signals that draw those letters on a screen.

The driver software then knows how to send the right signals to draw the characters ""Hello, world!"" into the memory buffer, so the hardware will draw those characters on the screen.

(The same idea if the video monitor is in graphics mode, but instead of shoving ASCII in a chunk of memory, instead, certain memory blocks representing the pixels on a screen are set to represent the shape of the letters in ""Hello, world!"")

----

Now this device driver knows how to flip the bits in the hardware, and the operating system knows how to talk to the device driver: how to find the device driver on disk, how to load the device driver (which is its own program) into memory, how to run the programs in the device driver as they need to be called.

----

At a higher level, the operating system then provides API endpoints which eventually talk to this device driver, and programs compiled for that operating system use a standard library (like [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/sources.html)) to talk to the operating system API endpoint.

And of course the operating system knows how to load your program into memory and run it.

----

So when you write a program like

    int main()
    {
        printf(""Hello, world!\n"");
        exit(0);
    }

Internally a call is made to `__vfprintf_internal`, which formats the string and writes the results to `stdout`, which is a FILE reference object that points to 'standard out.' Basically that object is a data structure which contains a reference to an operating-system supplied file descriptor which, before your program is started up, is connected the aforementioned device driver by default.

So when printf eventually pushes out the ASCII characters ""Hello, world!\n"" to the standard out stream, it writes those characters as a stream to a file reference, which goes to the device driver, that knows to take that string of ASCII and either put them in the text buffer (if your video card is in text mode), or paint them on the screen.

----

To make this even more complicated, there may be some program underneath that intercepts the standard input/standard output file references and does something else with them.

This is how a terminal program works on MacOS or on Linux; as the program starts up, it knows before starting your program up, to redirect the standard input and output files to itself. (See ['pipe'](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html) and ['fork'](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) for details in the POSIX standard.)

And so it receives the output of your program (rather than the underlying operating system) and the terminal program knows to then store the results in an internal array of characters, then redraw its window with the pixels representing ""Hello, world!""

A redrawing process that goes through a different API but eventually hits your video card device driver to flip the bits in memory representing the pixels on the screen that make up the letters ""Hello, world!""

----

As an aside, it's one reason why I wish more programmers would play with embedded hardware devices, like the Arduino. Because a lot of what's going on is made a lot more explicit without having an operating system in the middle: if you want to display ""Hello, world!"" on an Arduino graphics shield you wind up using a library (or writing your own) which fiddles the hardware bits on the hardware to cause the bits for ""Hello, world!"" to appear.",7,0,0,0,7,False,False,False,1632165082.0

I'm not a computer graphics person, so I could be wrong, but this sounds like Z-fighting. So maybe the problem isn't so much the lack of precision leading to loss of accuracy, but with the Z buffer implementation. Whether that's because of the SW or HW, I don't know.

> Why dont computers use 1024int numbers or even 4096/8192bit integers. Compared to normal hdd that have 500+GB of memory or even RAM memory if they are talking about it,its still a fraction of it and wouldn't take much space.

Ignoring the fact that very few people need the precision from a 8,192-bit integer, which others have pointed out, from the perspective of computer engineering, this is a terrible idea. Computers don't directly operate on data stored in the HDD or main memory. They move it into registers first. These days, even processors that implement out-dated CISC architectures (which can directly use operands in the main memory) move the operands into the registers first.

Moving 1 KB of data for one integer is terribly expensive in terms of bandwidth, latency, and power. The data path to main memory is 64 bits. In PC processors, you get like four or six of these channels. How many cycles is it going to take to transfer one of these 1 KB integers? (Not to mention that the current purpose of having four or six channels is not to transfer one big datum quickly, but for there to be concurrent accesses).

And power. Everybody agrees that we're using too much power moving data around. We would like the data to be closer to where its consumed. Hence the reason why we have HBM and the processor on an interposer: it's to reduce the distance, and hence latency and power. It's also the reason why there's research into alternative floating-point number systems like posits, which promise the same level of precision in half the bits (so a 32-bit posit can be substituted for a 64-bit IEEE 754 double). Posits would enable less power for data movement, allowing more for compute.

So far, we've viewed computers at an extremely high level. Data goes from one part to another, something happens, that's it. Modern computers aren't like this; or rather, modern processors aren't like this. Modern processors (and even very ones 50 years ago) have very heavily pipelined circuits, and the circuit blocks are decoupled with buffers. This is all so performance enhancing techniques like speculation, dynamic scheduling, and look-ahead can be used. Pipelining requires storage elements to hold state temporarily; buffers are small RAMs. If 8,192 bit integers are used, the storage elements for pipeline and buffers for decoupling and speculation will have to increase many times in size if there are to have the same amount of capacity in terms of entries. It's all infeasible in terms of area, delay, and power.

Also, while HDDs and the main memory aren't limited in capacity and could easily contain many of these big integers, the case isn't the same for the cache hierarchy. Your average L1 cache is several 10s of KB, your L2 is several 100s of KB, and your L3 is several 10s or a few hundred MB (for PC processors it's the lower end of that range).

> And CPUs today can do billions oc calculations per second so even if its a 8192bit numbers pc shouldnt have a problem.

Those billions of calculations per second are achieved on 32/64 data. If integers were 8,192 bits, I can guarantee you wouldn't reach anywhere near this level of performance. I would also make a distinction between throughput and latency. Billions of calculations per second is throughput; if you have a case where an operation depended on an earlier operation, performance would be hundreds of times lower, because doing arithmetic on 8,192 bits, from a computer arithmetic perspective, is *insane*.

Take an array multiplier as an example. Ignoring Booth re-encoding (which reduces the number of partial products we have to add), you'll need an 8,192 by 8,192 array of AND gates to generate the partial products: every bit in the multiplier is AND'ed with all those in multiplicand. 8,192 * 8,192 = 67,108,864. Each of these gates requires multiple transistors. A 64- by 64-bit multiplier only needs 4,096 gates. We haven't even gotten to summing the partial products yet, and we've already blown our transistor budget! There's techniques we can use to cut down the cost, but that's not my point. My point is that it's impractical to do 8,192-bit integer arithmetic in a timely fashion.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1632145262.0

If you're looking for a term to distinguish the theoretical from the applied, simply saying ""theoretical computer science"" would be enough for most people to understand you're referring to the mathematical studies of it.

 >Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself. As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software. Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications.

pqkib8,hdca3qj,t3_pqkib8,"Having not heard the term before I did a quick search and came across this: [Lock Free Programming](https://www.baeldung.com/lock-free-programming).

I've used all these techniques before; I just hadn't heard the term used to describe these techniques. 

(Apparently ""lock free"" and ""wait free"" does not mean ""never locks"" and ""never waits."" ""Lock free"" means at least one thread can proceed, and ""wait free"" means any waits for a lock are well-defined and finite in time. Such as associating locks with individual data structures rather than having a thread ""lock the world"" to accomplish a lengthy task.)

----

My honest suggestion is to use a language you're familiar with that provides good threading and core locking semantics you're familiar with, and build some sample programs to test the ideas out. (My favorite here is Java, but YMMV.)

----

When I do multi-threaded programming I also keep two other elements in mind. Most of my development is with front-end stuff, like desktop or mobile development, so again, YMMV:

1. Keep all main interactions or main computational elements on a main thread. (With UI, that means make all UI elements on the main thread; for other processing tasks, that means the 'coordinator' of tasks is the main thread.) Use background threads for small computational tasks, and if necessary, use a thread pool or even a dispatch mechanism (like MacOS/iOS's Grand Central Dispatch mechanism) to dispatch finite duration background tasks.

2. Guarantee locking and unlocking order when a thread needs to grab multiple locks on a resource.

    In other words, if you have resources A, B and C, and a thread needs B and C, while a second thread needs A and C, always lock in the order A, B, C. (That is, the first thread *always* locks B before C, and *always* unlocks C before B. And the second thread *always* locks A before C and *always* unlocks C before A.)

    This helps prevent deadlocks, such as when thread 1 locks C then tries to lock A, but thread 2 has locked A and is waiting to lock C.",4,0,0,0,4,False,False,False,1631978715.0

By definition, H is supposed to tell us whether the given program will halt on the input, so it is supposed to tell us whether H+ will halt on input H+. But the answer to that question contradicts itself, so there is no correct output H can give. So, H cannot exist.

At least at a glance, it is possible that H' exists, defined as:

pqhh7v,hdb0fl6,t3_pqhh7v,"The simple key to understanding the nature of the halting problem - is to realize that for any computing machines actions (outputs) to be predicted - it may at worse be required the running (simulating) of the program inside the computing machine who's actions your are trying to predict.

It's an obvious kind of thing, almost not worth mentioning and something which you can easily prove to yourself sitting in a chair.

The consequences of the halting problem are huge in the fields of P space complete (multiplayer) game theory - but the ways used to prove the halting problem (such as your referencing) are in my opinion a bit convoluted and outdated (involving printers etc).

The basic point they show in such videos is that it's necessary to know both a programs input and it's source code and most importantly, you must RUN that source code.

The correct perspective in which to understand the halting problem is algorithmic performance analysis, some algorithms can be verified in less time than it takes to actually run, for example if I tell you that I found some gigantic prime, then you can check if the number I found is indeed prime and in less time that in would take you to go looking thru a bunch of random huge (likely non-prime) numbers. 

The result was NO, you can't get away with any tricks, atleast in the worst case - there is no way to predict a programs output without actual execution of that program in the general case atleast.

In reality source code analysis is simple and effective, we most certainly can predict a programs output without actually running that program.

Though for some extremely high entropy highly optimized programs which generate extreme amounts of complex data (like video encoding and cryptanalysis resistant encryption) it is generally true that you cannot do better than to actually just run their source code.

pqhh7v,hdrm3lp,t3_pqhh7v,"You've stumbled on something relatively common in impossibility results - the argument tends to create a very contrived object. This is just as true for Godel's theorems, where the statement that isn't provable or disprovable is some terrifyingly huge construction nobody would really care about. It crops up in cryptography, where the initial proof of vulnerability of a class of protocols is something nobody would actually design.

You can look at the halting problem as the first step of an exploration into uncomputable functions, rather than a finished result. We have proven that it is impossible to build a program that will tell you whether *any* program will halt - there is at least one that it will fail on. Now we need to move to the next step - can we build a halting decider for the programs that we actually care about, and shove these theoretical counterexamples into a corner?

In the case of halting and uncomputable functions, we have a pretty rich landscape of things that we know. We have a variety of prospective halting deciders that are quite dependent on the form of logic that we use to analyze programs. We've written programs whose halting behavior is dependent on unproven (and in some neat cases, unprovable from standard axioms) theorems. We know that for many bounded forms of computation (like linearly bounded automata) their halting problem is decidable. More broadly, we know a lot of things that are uncomputable. One quite annoying one is Kolmogorov complexity - the smallest compressed form of a string. This means our compression algorithms will always be heuristics that can only approach optimal compression.

Whether any of this really truly impacts practical software development is a little bit iffy. It definitely does if you are interested in automated code analysis, but for day-to-day work we tend to work in the loosely-defined space of programs that humans can comprehend, and the degree to which that set even has formal computability properties is kind of an open question.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1632258695.0

Instead of proving ""there is no halting decider"", I will prove ""every program is not a halting decider"". There is no statement about hypothetical objects - I will only talk about actual programs that you can write down, and things they can or cannot do.

Consider a prospective halting decider H. Build the program

    def P {
      if H(<P>); LOOP
      else; HALT
    }

Since H is a real program, so is P. However, as you can see from its similarity to the example in the video, H will always be wrong about P - if H(<P>) is true, attempting to run P() will actually loop, and vice versa. So, P shows that there is at least one program every given prospective halting decider H will be wrong about.

pqffop,hdbw1d3,t3_pqffop,"I sat in on a lecture one time that has a profound effect on how I view programming language semantics and my personal development philosophy. Basically the summation of the lecture was every change in a software system increases entropy in that system. We all know this to be true when looking at the end users requirements, but we never evaluate, and sometimes we are not even aware of the requirements we introduce into the system as developers. One of the bigger examples that was used was the object-relational impedance mismatch. Which OO introduces, the mismatch is where the entropy manifested and because we as humans tend to grasp graph based data structures as easier to visualize in our mind. Thus we introduce concepts like ORM's to deal with that entropy, but many of us find the ORM becomes a beast of its own, most will overlook the fact that developer driven requirements introduced the complexity that manifested due to this.

Some will elect to throw out relational data structures all together, which proved to not work well as for most data to be of it's most value it must conform to first order logic and relational theory.  So what if we go the other way abandon graph based aesthetics in code and use first order logic. It's been done and it produces extremely difficult languages to reason about, ProLog would be one of them, and it is in my opinion very difficult to write a comprehensive system in it, and extremely time consuming to do so, but it produces far more accurate and predictable software (in my opinion again). Anyways to me, it's about finding a balance, OO reduces reasoning complexity but increases system complexity, but at the end of the day, we do have to work on these systems thus need to be able to reason about and visualize them in our mind.

Tools have their domains in which they work best. So for some class of problems OOP may be a better tool than (say) [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). (And in some domains we may not even know how to solve the problem using declarative programming--like, for example, building a functional user interface.)

But then, in other domains (like building a parser), OOP may not be the best tool for the job--at which point you want a declarative language, like YACC, to do the job.

And even other domains where a mix of tools is best--like building the user interface layout using a declarative system (say, in XML, like for Android) or even graphically (say, in Xcode for iOS), then building the functional aspects using OOP.

pphwcc,hd4nw69,t3_pphwcc,"New OSes are developed all the time, many of them do have some cool features that make them ""technically better"" than the competition. The problem is that OSes are _very_ sticky in that once an OS has established it's position in the market, it generally stays there. A rival OS would have to offer the end users a significant advantage over the established players to tempt people away - a small advantage probably isn't going to cut it.

Remember Windows phones? Microsoft is really good at designing OSes, and the actual OS of Windows Mobile was technically really good. It even had some neat features to ""outshine"" the competition. However, try as they might they just couldn't break through. This is an example of how it is _really difficult_ to make an OS and to win over developers, especially if the market has already established itself.

On the flip side of this, Android in particular was an OS in the right place ant the right time to take off. It managed to ride the smart device market and it managed to quickly establish itself partly because there weren't many competitors in that space at the time. Once Android had established itself with good developer support and crucially a larger user base, nothing was going to touch it.

Another key point in the question is developers. Unix is still popular in part because it is tried and tested, and there are developers who will ""instantly"" be able to use pretty much any Unix-like system. If you are making a new OS you can totally do your own thing and not be unlike everything else, but _every_ developer will have to scale a large learning curve to start writing code. Your OS might use a new approach which is technically better, but that doesn't matter if no one will use it. Time is money and if the same thing can be done on a Unix-like system quicker then they'll use Unix.

A good example of this is Plan 9. It has some really impressive OS features which are just different enough from ""actual"" Unix to confuse Unix developers. I would argue many of the concepts used in Plan 9 are better than old school Unix, but that doesn't matter when the end result is a program that would do the same thing.

Finally, if you're a company who wants to, say, host a website, are you going to go with Windows or Linux (or BSD if you like) which is well documented, well supported, well proven, pretty much guaranteed to work on your hardware and is the de facto option? Or are you going to use the new unproven 300450500350400550 OS™ which is up to 20% faster than the alternatives if used correctly, only supports intel processors from 2019 and none of your developers know how to maintain? Yeah, it's a no brainer for the company.

*tl;dr* - OSes are sticky. Once they are established they hang around for a long time and it's difficult for a newcomer to break through.

An important reason why new operating systems have not gained ground is inertia. In particular, if you tried to design a new operating system that doesn't provide an environment that's compatible with existing applications and operating systems, you'll miss out on having an application base for the operating system. That's going to be a showstopper for an OS becoming widely used in the vast, vast majority of cases.

You can only gain ground for a new operating system that's not at least somewhat compatible with existing ones if the new OS is part of a paradigm shift, or perhaps by providing a vastly superior experience to users. In both cases it still also requires good market sense and timing as well as luck.

Google was able to introduce Android as a new operating system [1], but largely because they did it on the emerging platform of smart phones. They did not replace an existing operating system on similar devices. Apple has been able to introduce incompatible changes in macOS, but that's partially because of their vertical integration, partially due to a dedicated following and successful branding, and partially because of providing a good enough (and well-marketed) product that people were willing to make the jump despite having to switch their applications.

In addition to applications, hardware compatibility is more or less tied to the operating system. Even if it's not tightly built into the core of the OS itself (as in Linux), the OS would still need to either support a vast variety of hardware by itself, or it'll need to attract hardware vendors to write drivers for the OS. The former is a formidable task for the OS developers, and the latter requires market share, which you generally don't have if you're starting out with a new OS. Or you'll need to be Apple who both write the OS and design and sell the hardware and select its components. If you're not controlling the entire technology stack from the hardware to the OS, it's massively difficult to build hardware compatibility that's anywhere close to what existing operating systems are able to provide.

On a related note, a clean slate operating system might be able to do some things better than existing systems simply by avoiding the baggage, but existing ones have solved lots of practical problems that a newly designed and written OS would need to solve again. [2] There's some merit to maturity even if it comes with not being able to be as flexible with trying new approaches.

That's not even getting into directly human factors such as people learning the new OS.

 >The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a ""software tools"" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software; these norms became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the ""Unix philosophy"".

When your codebase is small, it doesn't matter too much, but when it's bigger, with multiple people working on, then static typing is a no-brainer.

When I was much younger, and just starting out, I often gravitated towards dynamically typed languages, now, I don't go anywhere near them.

I can see the appeal, they *look* easier, but in reality, are probably harder.

I think if we look at more recently created languages like Swift or Kotlin, they are statically typed, but *look* dynamically typed, that seems to be the way the industry is going right now.

pp6jgs,hd1wyjp,t3_pp6jgs,"An argument in favor of dynamic type languages (though, I am not in favor of one over the other in all cases) :

**The duck test:**

>If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.

In dynamic type languages you can use objects by knowing only a part of their attributes, while disregarding their class (unless you would like to check). If the object you are using has the appropriate member, then the rest can be literal dragons for all client-code cares. This is somewhat similar to Java's Interfaces, but way more powerful.

The fact that complete knowledge of the type of an object is not a prerequisite means that you can design more flexible APIs that play nicely with third parties. This is a huge plus for adding to open source libraries, that's mostly why languages like Python and JavaScript are so popular.

Case point: Think of Python's `numpy` library for arrays, on top of which Google's `Tensorflow` and Facebook's `PyTorch` machine learning libraries are built, as well as the CSV handling library `pandas`. Now imagine having all of those teams needing to include each other's header files and static types. You would never even manage to install them.

Some minor points:

* Conventions over rules: Dynamic type languages rely on conventions to make things work (e.g. you expect a collection to have the language's form of `.length` attribute). This is somewhat stronger because you are free to break them and/or introduce new ones when you really need to.
* The real issue is rarely about primitive types. A decent IDE will mark those. The real problems arise when you have no idea what kind of objects you are using. Especially in generic collections.
* With the wide adoption of Docstrings/javaDocs etc and proper documentation in industry code, ""type hints"" can be given in dynamic typed languages so their problems are becoming much less of an issue.
* I would say that dynamic typed languages have a steeper learning curve for newcomers, as they need to learn the conventions along with the language.
* Stability vs ""API power"" is a tradeoff: I work in Academia and I need to use experimental libraries, tweak their source code or build on them. I would instantly quit if I had to even type the name of every class that I am using.

pp6jgs,hd3gzbd,t3_pp6jgs,"The prevalence of dynamically typed languages can be explained because the vast majority of professional software engineering these days is in support of building web applications.

Lets say you're writing the server-side of some big web application.  You probably aren't storing objects in your database, you're using SQL, and as a result have to pack and unpack your objects into Strings, ints, Dates, etc. on the way in and out of the database.  The structures your code emits are all text in the form of html, css, javascript, and json, to be interpreted by the browser on the receiving end.  You are casting everything you work with constantly to make the type-checking compiler happy, and in the end, you still need to defensively code against type-coercion problems so you aren't seeing the benefit of the type-checking compiler proving some level of correctness... so the only benefit you can claim is 'speed'.

But in web development, we don't scale the app by making each request/response cycle faster, we scale the app by making more parallel request/response cycles happen at the same time.  We do this first by launching many application processes, then by launching many machines and load balancing between them.  We get speed through horizontal scalability, and eventually the bottleneck is the database (which is supported by a vendor, and written in, you guessed it, a type-safe language).

The cost of the compute time is dwarfed by the cost of the army of developers... so instead of optimizing for the cost of the compute cycles, we optimize for the cost of the developers.  This means ""lets make cheaper developers more productive"".  That again trends toward dynamic languages.

Add to that the prevalence of Javascript.  No matter what you do, you aren't going to get away from the need to use dynamic languages when building web applications.

pp6jgs,hd35d0k,t3_pp6jgs,"Python and JavaScript aren't just dynamic typed; they're duck typed.

That is, types guarantee basically nothing. You could have two objects `my_obj_1` and `my_obj_2` both of type `Duck` with *completely* different attributes. This is because an object's attributes can change at runtime (i.e. existing attributes can disappear and new attributes can be declared). Functions can also be redefined on-the-fly. The type of an object really only tells you how it was *constructed* rather than how it's defined *now*.

So just because `isinstance(my_obj, Duck)` is true, that doesn't mean `my_obj.looks_like(Duck)` or `my_obj.quacks_like(Duck)`. The reverse is true as well, which puts the ""probably"" in the statement, ""if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it **probably** is a duck"".

As such, you can never really guarantee anything about the implementation of an object, neither by type checking nor attribute checking. As such, duck-typed languages rely heavily on **convention** and **trust**; I trust you not to change the definitions of my objects so that my convention remains consistent and reliable. If you break my trust and start altering my object's definitions, my convention falls apart, and I can no longer guarantee anything about what my objects really are or how they behave.

In languages with dynamic typing but not duck typing, the type is still meaningful and thus can provide guarantees; it is simply that a name may refer to any type of object, and the exact type of object to which it refers is not determined until runtime (imagine polymorphism in Java if everything was declared as type `Object` and was automatically downcasted to its dynamic type whenever using it).

As to why people use it? It's because 1) if you're writing a small project or script by yourself and you don't need to put trust in other dependencies not to break your conventions, you can often write code more quickly in duck-typed languages than in static-typed languages; and 2) the learning curve is low.

Python is used a lot in machine learning today because a lot of the machine learning community consists of researchers; researchers tend to disregard code quality in favor of speed of implementation since their code is only intended to be run once in an isolated experimental setting.

pp6jgs,hd43jyk,t3_pp6jgs,"To throw into the great discussions elsewhere:

One of the advantages of static typing is that we make potential errors **compiler errors** that can be caught at compile time, rather than run-time errors which can only be caught at run-time.

For small programs, that's less of a concern, since often for small programs typing can become a detriment in getting something up and running quickly. 

(So to answer your question: if you're building something relatively small and need to do it relatively quickly--a dynamically typed language can be a big win in terms of quickly writing code.)

But as complexity grows, you really want to make more and more problems 'compiler errors' rather than 'runtime errors.' That way you can validate more and more of your code at compile time, catching problems right away rather than having to exercise all of the code paths to make sure there are no potential problems.

----

Type errors are just one category of errors that can be caught at compile time or deferred to run time. There are other categories of errors which can similarly be caught early or deferred (requiring more complex unit testing to validate).

For example, Objective-C (and Swift, which inherits many of the problems of Objective-C) does not have a notion of 'abstract methods.' Nor is it necessarily a compiler error for a class to inherit an interface (or '@protocol') but not define several methods in the interface. (For missing method calls, which Objective-C calls 'selectors', if the method could not be found, the NSObject's 'resolveClassMethod' and 'resolveInstanceMethod' methods are invoked, giving the class a way to dynamically handle these calls.)

But that means if you have a typo in your method declaration, you won't know it until you try to exercise that bit of code.

Meaning a missing abstract method is a run-time error.

In C++, on the other hand, it's a compile-time error; the compiler will complain if there are any abstract virtual functions not declared in a class that is instantiated.

----

I like pushing all errors onto the compiler, and I hate languages which defer checking for relatively easy-to-catch errors to the run-time environment.

It’s worth knowing about time and space complexity as well, so maybe that’s a good starting point if you’re math oriented. 

For example, if I gave you a list of numbers and asked you to search for some number N, what’s the fastest way you could do that? Can you save time anywhere? The base solution would take about as long as it would take to read the list, but you can do better with smarter data organization!

poogz8,hd1o4gy,t3_poogz8,"I would primarily focus on discrete math and algorithms, linear algebra, and statistics. That seems to be the most used in my opinion. Not to say calculus isn't important, because it definitely is (especially for machine learning), but the most I used it for was to do basic integration or doing derivatives in most classes. Only recently have I been using it for ML and but at the same time, this isn't my research area so I don't really care all that much about it right now.

I'll share all the ""math"" classes I had to take so far and attempt to categorize them into three sections. Discrete (which should ideally be your first introduction to the type of math most of your ""math classes"" in your degree will consist of) will be the logic section and arguably the most important since it contains the foundation of ""how to think like a programmer/computer scientist"".

Anything under the discrete section are based on logic or critical thinking.  Stats and Linear Algebra may be small but those classes that use these concepts are still important and all tie in together. 

If you actually want to learn the math before jumping into CS then you may do well by going through a formal mathematics route in that case Discrete/Proofs/Graph Theory/Game Theory/etc would interest you more. Hopefully, you or others find this useful! :)

I haven't used [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) in quite some time, but I seem to recall that it came with something called USBCap. Typically WireShark is used to view inspect network traffic (e.g. your TCP/IP packets going between your machine and the web server), [but it can also be used to examine USB data](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Wireshark+and+USB/23457/).

Finally, it's worth noting that keyboards aren't 'output-only' devices. Or in other words, they don't just send data to your computer, but they can also receive it.

So even though Epp won't prepare you for everything in CLRS, don't worry about everything.  Epp's book prepares you for the parts of CLRS that you should study in an intro class.  

If you want to read Rosen as well as Epp, or instead of Epp, that's probably fine.  I personally feel like if you just read one of these books that's enough.

 >Quantum computing is the exploitation of collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. :I-5 They are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science.

pnp559,hcr4zah,t3_pnp559,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""skip code"". Let's start with some definitions: a ""branch"" is any time the program decides to go to one of multiple choices. If statements are branches, but so are loop conditions or switch statements (python doesn't have these). I'll talk about branches in general.  


If you mean running only one side of the branch, there are a few reasons a language would do that. The most obvious is performance. If the user only asked you to do one side of the branch, why would you waste time doing the other? The other reason for this is correctness. The user probably put the condition in there for a reason. The if statement might be checking to make sure you didn't do some illegal operation or violate some safety condition (see below for a fun example of when this goes wrong).  


If you mean running only some of the checks in the condition (like when you have an ""and"" or ""or"" statement), there are the same two reasons: performance and safety. Most languages will only evaluate a condition until they can be sure of the outcome, but no more (this is called ""short circuiting""). If I have ""if f() or g()"", the program will only run g() if f() is false. This means we don't have to do extra work. If g() is only meaningful when f() is false, then it's also a safety concern.  


To your top-level question: branches are somewhat inefficient, but not to a degree that really matters for the vast majority of code (certainly not something like python). The reason comes down to how CPUs work. CPUs try to run lots of stuff at once. They usually are half-way through processing a bunch of instructions at any given time. There are a few forms of this, but pipelining and out-of-order execution are the big ones if you want to Google more. Basically, if you ask the CPU to do a bunch of unrelated things in a row, it can do some or all of them at the same time instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the next one. The bottom line is that when you branch, the computer can't do anything until it knows the result of the branch. It looses all that nice parallelism.  


Mitigations and why this isn't really all that big of a problem: High performance CPUs do something called ""speculation"". They do stuff that they aren't sure is legal until later. They have a bunch of predictors (e.g. 'branch predictor') that tells them what the most likely outcome is and they do that until they know for sure. If they were wrong, they just undo everything up until that point and try again. Branch predictors are really really good, for most code they almost always guess right. Some types of code are fundamentally unpredictable and that can be a problem but in general speculation is so good and Python has so many overheads already that if you are worried about the cost of branches, you should probably be writing it in C++ or something.  


Fun fact: This speculation violates all the performance and safety stuff I mentioned earlier! The performance part is easy: they CPU wouldn't have anything to do anyway so it may as well run part of the branch. The safety part is more interesting. CPUs are pretty fancy and they keep track of everything that's going on, so when they go down the wrong path they're pretty good at undoing everything. They try to avoid stuff that might cause side effects (e.g. none of your changes to memory can be seen by anyone until the checks are done). Unfortunately, some recent attacks called Specter and Meltdown showed that we weren't as good as we thought. It turns out really clever hackers can leave 'bread-crumbs' behind after the CPU cleaned up. All those tricks to guess what's going to happen? They learn from stuff that happened before, even on failed guesses! You can then use some clever performance measurements to see if they learned from the wrong branch. It's pretty wild and very hard to fix since those 'guessers' are so key to performance that you can't really just get rid of them.

This is handled through predication registers on the cpu that hold boolean values.

Compilers tend to try pretty hard to keep related code close together in memory to minimize that problem (though obviously it's not always possible). Another big problem is with flushing the pipeline. The CPU is always trying to run ahead of execution and have multiple instructions in flight at the same time. When you hit a branch, the CPU doesn't know what the next instruction is so it has to wait for everything to finish before starting something new. For really small, low-performance, CPUs this isn't really that big a deal. But for big fancy CPUs (most of the CPUs people think of), this can be a really big deal. Pipelines can have 10s of steps that can all be running at the same time (each instruction has to do 10 things, but 10 instructions can be doing one of the things at the same time). Beyond pipelining, they can be ""out-of-order"", which basically means that not only can it be running different parts of multiple instructions at the same time, it can be running the same part of multiple instructions simultaneously. At the end of the day, you might have hundreds of instructions in flight at any given time.

The internet communicates via packets. Packets need to contain the source IP address and the destination IP address in order to route packets successfully. This information can also not be encrypted because how would you establish encryption between yourself and a server without first contacting the server to do a TLS handshake? Moreso each router your packet routes through would need to know how to decrypt that information in order to route packets successfully which would essentially defeat the purpose of encryption so the source IP address and destination IP address of a packet is always visible and not encrypted.

So people can “sniff” those packets and see what IP addresses are talking to each other using software tools like WireShark (you should download WireShark if you’re interested in this kind of thing and sniff packets running through the WiFi network you’re connected to).

However, the packets don’t contain any unencrypted information that says this IP address belongs to so and so. But IMO, people can easily socially engineer a scheme to determine this mapping. So, yes people can find your current IP address with some effort. 

I don’t think someone having your IP address is necessarily dangerous if you’re not doing anything illegal but I’d love to here someone else’s take on this.

Deep learning takes it a step further. Not sure about anything else that might be considered deep learning, but neural networks are a form of deep learning. You have a bunch of systems of a equations that approximate a bunch of linear regressions on a bunch of inputs.

These are much more complex and even explaining them broadly leads to complex descriptions, but each neuron is essentially a linear system, and if you have more than one layer, you have something called ""auto-regression"", since linear systems in the second layer have inputs that are the outputs of the first layer.

Stdout as a byte stream _is_ the greatest common denominator. You could use more structured data in many contexts, and some commands _do_ accept JSON or XML or postscript data on stdin, but finding a universally agreed upon format is going to be near-impossible.

For example, compression utilities like `gzip` accept arbitrary binary data from stdin and compress it. What if instead `gzip` expected to receive some JSON, containing metadata like the original filename, modification date, and the binary data to compress? Well now whatever utility is piping data to `gzip` needs to know what tags `gzip` will look for, and provide that metadata as JSON. That implies that any tool that's going to interface with `gzip` needs to be written _specifically_ with `gzip` in mind. With the current ""stdin is binary data"" design, I can pipe _any_ command to `gzip`, like `curl`, `tar`, some random python script, and it'll ""just work"", even if the program on the left side of the pipe was never built to connect to `gzip`.

If you want `gzip` and other compression tools like `bzip2` to be interchangeable in a pipe, then they need to use a common set of metadata fields, or else interoperable tools will have to be aware of whether they're piping to `gzip` or `bzip2` and support _both_ ""protocols"".

In the early days of computers, people were still figuring out whether or not to use binary or decimal, and whether or not computers should be mechanical or electrical.

In the modern day we've mostly agreed on electric computers operating in binary, but that's a matter of convenience, not necessity.

You could totally make a binary computer with gears and cogs, it would just be very slow and would require a disproportionate level of effort to manufacture. (Any time that you can construct logic gates (ANDs, ORs, NOTs, etc) you can make a binary computer. Stand-Up maths has a great video about using dominoes to perform arithmetic using this principle: [https://youtu.be/OpLU\_\_bhu2w](https://youtu.be/OpLU__bhu2w))

And you could also totally have a decimal electric computer. ~~In fact, since decimal is so much more space efficient than binary you would save a lot of electricity! But squeezing that level of precision into your electronics would either require ludicrously high voltages or a level of precision that we still aren't able to reliably accomplish.\*~~ Computerphile has some great videos on the subject.

It mostly relied on the fact that tech at the time was 5 volt and the ""0"" and ""1"" values used the voltage ranges that were defined in the 1950's. I forget the exact values, let's say it was 0-1 volt is a ""0"" and 3-5 volts is a ""1"". The gap was to allow for tolerances, circuits are never precise and you need a little gap to accurately determine that the value has changed. Needless to say that circuits are more precise than they were in the 1950s, so the tolerances could be tightened and more states introduced in between.

The hard part is how to use those extra states? All of the logic circuits and software have been designed around only having 2 states. Modern computers are built off of >70 years of research and development that is all based on the concept of there being only two states. True computers could be used to  speed up the process but it would take a significant estimate and effort.

A similar example to give some color, let's say it was decided that 26 letters in the alphabet were not enough and we need to add one more:

What logistics would be necessary to add it?
Which languages would it get added to?
How would we write it?
Where in the alphabet would it go?
Do the existing words need to use it?

Where does it go on the keyboard?

pkn21x,hc69gcr,t3_pkn21x,"You are going to get a lot of answers that say robotics, and or embedded and those are really good suggestions as they teach the principles of development without adding in all the layers of cruft that modern web dev and other disciplines bring to the table.

Other good ideas are Crypto dev, but that too is mired in steep learning curve to start accomplishing things and brings a host of unfamiliar concepts. Which creates a wall to understanding when introducing people to concepts you want to reduce that wall as the quicker they hit that ahah point, the sooner they go from just receivers of information, to organizers of information in a way that they can didactically learn.

Knowing that, my recommendation would be focus on hacking, why hacking because it inverts learning, you don't need to know everything about computing and programing and theory and best practices and ad nauseum to just make a todo list, you just need a computer, a vulnerability and a script. You just need to understand how one exploit works and that builds a deep understand of how the language, the compiler, memory, etc. etc. work. Understanding how to break things, only involves breaking it and then asking why. It makes it very digestible.

Other reasons for hacking:

\#1 you are talking about high school, social credit is huge in high school, how many movies have been made about robotics clubs? How many have been made about hackers? Who was cooler? Baseline is, you are going to be a more attractive club and that is what you want to do is attract people. Hacking will draw the people that would naturally be attracted to a robotic club, but it is also going to draw a more diverse set of people, this is beneficial because it will bring diversity of thought.

\#2 Hacking (as well a robotics) is easy to gamify, there are huge tournaments and war games that teams can compete in when hacking. Unlike robotics there are a lot of online events that hackers compete in, that do not require physical presence this gives more opportunities to compete in group events, rather than just the physical meetup opportunities.

\#3 there are hacker bounties which pay real money so there are endless sets of challenges to work on as your club levels up.

\#5 most CS disciplines never teach computing from this angle, if they do, they just glance over it. It inverts the way you think about computing and that can be very beneficial even if you pursue a normal career in computing.

\#6 it is by far the most approachable way to learn computing, you do not even need to know how to script to start. But will learn to script little by little, then how compilers and interpreters work little by gaining small digestible pieces of knowledge along the way, until one day, a full picture is developed.

pkn21x,hc6ng8b,t3_pkn21x,"I recommend you avoid long lectures. No one is going to be interested in more school, in school. Keep things short, with very short, simple goals. Just get everyone to download a compiler and IDE, get them to copy-paste a ""Hello, World!"" program, and that alone is a victory for the day. The room is going to be loud, it's going to be busy, half the room is going to be there just to socialize. Work with the chaos, not against it. Those who bring their laptops and get their first programs to compile, they're going to want to know more - you're all going to be running around each others computers as you showcase some basic programming, and some of them may enthusiastically print stupid shit in a loop. Fantastic.

The point is not to teach a lesson, but to inspire the members to go off and self-study. Come back having learned something new since last time.

You can host [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk). Typically the point is to showcase something you're working on and what you've learned from it.

For example, a friend of mine hacked his 3D printer firmware to lower the bottom-end temperature safety cut-off so he can print with some ultra-low melting point plastics - he had a problem that he couldn't get the original firmware to go that low, the software assumed the heating element was malfunctioning. Specifically, he had to write some [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) code, which is a really awesome thing you're going to want in your life for future projects. Anything that needs to reach a steady state is controlled with PID, from engine idle, to cruise control, motor speeds, flow rates, temperatures, voltages, light intensities, you name it.

My favorite format works like this: you need a dry erase board with time slots. It's first come, first served - show up, and write your name and the title of your lightning talk. If the board fills up, that's all the talks for this meeting. There are some local quarterly industry meetups near me that does this. They rent out a space and setup multiple stations like this. Every half hour you gotta cruise the floor and see what talks are showing up and choose what you want to see. You should start with just one station and see how it goes.

I recommend you always know the format and content of the next meeting, this meeting. Don't plan a lightning talk session if you don't already know if there aren't going to be enough people to fill spots. Deep, focused dives and collaborative projects aren't for everyone. So if you've got a switching and routing project for everyone, some people might want to know not to show up ahead of time. And again, don't just plan it without knowing you have enough interest in it. Get everyone to vote on like a top 3 pick of ideas for the session after next.

I would recommend that club members invest ~$25 and pick up an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

And the .1 address is often used by the gateway, but that is a convention, not a standard.",33,0,0,0,33,False,False,False,1630922064.0
pivg21,hclxrwt,t3_pivg21,"Gotta remember that the reason subnets exist is to make small pools that can talk to each other, and then be able to tell whether another computer is in the same pool or not. If we just had 500,000 computers with their own number, to talk to one of them you'd have to communicate with all of them to find all their numbers, before you could get to the one you want and that wastes bandwidth like crazy.

Broken down into small subnets, you have only the size of the subnet to talk to, e.g. 64 computers *and* ""outside this subnet"" for everything else. That allows for routing, and it means the routing tables only have to go subnet->subnet, and not 500,000 different rules. Important, because early computers and routers and switches had very limited computing power and memory.

So the subnet address typically `192.168.1.0` (but not necessarily) is the one which tells you ""that other computer I want to talk to, is it in my subnet or not?"". You can't use it as a computer address because comparing IP address against the subnet address is the way to distinguish whether you can talk directly to a computer or need to route somewhere else.

The broadcast address typically `192.168.1.255` is the ""talk to every computer in this subnet"" address. It's not always supported, but if you try to ping that address you might get a reply from every machine which is powered on. Not all that useful, reserved by the design of networks.

`.1` is not anything special, but it comes in with the idea of ""outside this subnet"" and ""need to route somewhere else"". If you do the calculations and find ""that remote computer is outside this subnet"", how do you talk to it? You pass the traffic onto something else which can route closer to it. That has to be something you can talk directly to, so it has to be within your subnet. It's typically a device acting as a default gateway, and using the first or last address, e.g. `.1` just for convenience.",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1631479555.0

pivg21,hbsp0s1,t1_hbsflb6,"There's probably a more suitable sub for networking questions 🙂

Disclaimer: my networking courses were a long time ago and I never liked network stuff, so the answers won't be super precise.

Anyways, here it is.

Every network subnet is comprised of:   
- A network address.  
- A usable IP range.  
- A broadcast address.  

The network address is always the first IP address within the network IP range. It uniquely identifies the network segment and with the network mask (or CIDR), it serves as a reference to calculate the other possible IP addresses within it.

The usable IP range is the list of IPs that can be assigned to the network elements located within this subnet.

The broadcast address is always the last IP address, it's used when a packet needs to be sent to all the IP addresses within the IP range.

The network and the broadcast addresses are reserved and should never be assigned to a network element.

For simplicity's sake, your professor used type C networks (network mask 255.255.255.0, CIDR /24) to illustrate this.   
These networks' IP range is always exactly 256. Their first IP address is always .0 (the network address) and their last IP address is always .255 (the broadcast address). Their usable IP range is always from .1 to .254.

Note that your teacher told you that .1 was a reserved address. It is not, because it's actually within the usable IP range.   
By convention, many people (incl. me) will use the .1 IP as the gateway IP (the router that allows communication between several networks). I've seen some places/people use the .254 as the gateway IP.   
This is just a convention, that has nothing to do with technical requirements. Your gateway IP could be right the middle of your IP range if you wanted.

I wont go into the calculation, because there are tons of resources online and because the last I did was over 15 years ago 😅.

Hopefully this will help you.

Note: all of this applies to IPv4. IPv6 changes many things and the above is probably not applicable. I never really took the time to learn more about IPv6 so I can't get into more details.",4,0,0,0,4,False,False,False,1630927297.0

So after working for 2 year in friends company I got an offer as a manual tester in 2018 in other state but by that time my sickness really got over me and I couldn't understand why it's so tough to get a head around simple code(I always like to read and watch about coding html css js python sometime c# java c) and doing some simple physical task I thought that might have something do with my depression. So I got a job as a associat tester profile I work for 1 year I build a test plan from scratch for a ERP product but by the end of the year my immune system became so weak that I had typhoid and jondis  together so I have to leave that job and move back to my hometown straight bed rest for 6 months it was year 2019 after that one of my relative suggest me to work in his company where I have to maintain a online store of electronics shop on different global ecommerce platform but then covid pendamic hit globally and I loose my job I again get into depression ....and lot of struggle and emotion from personal to professional but .

But I think it's more equitable to consider all programming languages dialects of each other, so once you have a good understanding of a single language, you can learn a new accent, or new words that get used in a particular region. One foreign language may not give you a leg up on other foreign languages.

The bigger hurdle I see with learning any language is use and practice. It's far easier to find material you can work on yourself with a programming language. You can take your time, deconstruct, and reconstruct new things as you come upon them and return to where you left off. In contrast, you can probably find various foreign media to practice your foreign language on, but the information will come very quickly and in methods you might not be able to easily look up. For example, hearing a new word in a film or show will not provide you with a spelling. Looking that word up isn't always an option as the media continues to play. A big part of this difficulty comes from the type of media each is normally expressed in (written programming vs spoken foreign).",3,0,0,0,3,False,False,False,1630894632.0

pin2ke,hbs44h5,t3_pin2ke,"Welp, I guess I'm the first one to go against the grain here and say programming languages are harder for me.  Several people have pointed out how much easier it is to learn the syntax of PLs.  That's true, and if that's all you consider knowing a programming language to be, then I agree.

For a little context on me, I have 2 Masters degrees, one in Applied Linguistics and the other in Computer Science.  I consider myself in the upper-intermediate / lower-advanced range in Spanish and Portuguese.  I'm about to start French 101 soon, because I enjoy learning human languages.  

Besides the programming experience from university, I had 1.5 years of part-time internship experience and almost 3 years full time as a software engineer, mostly in Java but this year mostly C# (and the syntax is extremely similar between the two).  So I've had a lot of experience learning both human languages and PL's.

At the risk of turning this into a semantics debate, I personally do not consider knowing the syntax of a PL as fluency.  I have made it my mission to understand design patterns in the language, clean code, etc., and I don't yet feel confident that I know those well.  Using crappy code but syntactically correct, I can generally get the program to do what I want.  But I also figured out early on in Spanish that I could say ""You know, the thing that does this in the car"" and convey the meaning I wanted.  I also don't consider that fluency.

My advanced Spanish comes mostly from a year traveling in Latin America over a decade ago, and sporadic practicing since.  Even when traveling, I spent a lot of time speaking English with other travelers in hostels.

I've been working full-time, M-F, for 3 years.  I've tied much of my self-worth to writing good code, started taking Adderall, etc., and again, don't feel great about it.  If I spent the same amount of timing practicing Spanish, well... I can't be certain, but given the time/energy investment rates between HL's and PL's, I would say I pick up HL's much faster.

Everybody's different, so maybe I'm an outlier in that sense, or maybe you don't agree with how I've defined learning a HL/PL, which is fine.  Just my thoughts.",-1,0,1,0,-1,False,False,False,1630909553.0

Maybe put limits like the code can't have pathological branch-prediction failure behavior, cache-thrashing access patterns,  sequential floating point divisions, etc. and then see how much RAM the CPU can use in the time it could take to load data from a top-of-the-line NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD at its max sequential read rate.

There's a WD Black SSD with advertised sequential reads up to 7 GB/s and random read IOPS of 1,000,000, and sequential writes up to 5.3 GB/s and random write IOPS of 720,000.  ([source](https://www.gamingpcbuilder.com/ssd-ranking-the-fastest-solid-state-drives/))

The Wikipedia page for DDR5 RAM has a figure of 51.2 GB/s per channel as the max supported bandwidth, with up to *6400 million* transfers per second.

So that's still 7-10 time faster if we just look at the GB/s values (ignoring all the complications added by transfer rates involving particular possibly varying size transfers, access patterns, read/write queueing, etc.). Taking AVX-512 instructions running at .25 instructions per clock-tick at a clock of 2.8 GHz ([source](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/01/17/avxfreq1.html)) that's a processing throughput of approx. 700,000,000 (2.8 GHz / 4 = 700 MHz) \* 64 (bytes per 512 bit register), or about 45 GB/s (not GiB/s but 10^(9)). 

So taking all my napkin-math for close-ish, you could process your way through all of that 1 TB of RAM (or are we talking 1 TiB of RAM?) every 20 seconds, in which time a single SSD would only be able to provide \~100 GB of newly read data.

>Once correct timestamp is established, monotonic clock should measure clock draft during connection for generating future timestamps which will be used for future needs.

There be dragons. If you think you know how timing works on a computer, and you didn't both write the code and design the hardware, you're probably mistaken. I've mucked about with various low-level timing coprocessors and hardware-based profiling timing code, etc, but I would not consider myself competent to answer your question exactly.

Here's an interesting discussion of Linux CLOCK\_MONOTONIC that might be useful:  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3523442/difference-between-clock-realtime-and-clock-monotonic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3523442/difference-between-clock-realtime-and-clock-monotonic)

IDK what operating system you're working with. If it's Windows, GFL. If it's Linux, well... GFL, but you won't need as much luck. CLOCK\_MONOTONIC is apparently not monotonic (NTP can affect it). If you used some kind of slow-sync monotonic adjustment scheme (you never adjust a clock backwards) to create your own clock backend on CLOCK\_MONOTONIC\_RAW where you'd sync with NTP now and then, but introduce those adjustments slowly (say, over the course of an hour or a day instead of all at once). Oh, and BTW if your system hibernates or is in a VM, that can affect it too. And CLOCK\_MONOTONIC\_RAW drift can be significant and might have other limitations/quirks depending on hardware. If you're not using specialized hardware and you actually care about the results of your code, (i.e. you're doing something important and irrevocable, like financial transactions or launching a missile or something) you're probably fscked without hardware support.

&#x200B;

>In short, what I want to achieve is to have accurate time in trust-less decentralized network where is impossible to manipulate time accuracy or to be extremely difficult, like abnormal difficult.

If you have an environment where you don't trust ANY node in the network (except your central server) then you can have temporal tokens introduced by the central server which allow a node to prove that a piece of data was sent *after* the time when the token was generated. You can also have a token-request system wherein one node can ask a central server to sign something (that something can be encrypted in a way the server can't read) to attest that it was received at a certain time.

If you don't trust \_any\_ node (no central server) including NTP, I mean... who can you trust?

Also you might look at [trusted timekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping).

pi22kr,hbojnlg,t1_hbniyia,"I think some more general examples would help here:

**Example 1:**

Let's imagine you want to invert all the colours in an image e.g. for each pixel you want to do something like this:

    output_colour.r = 1 - input_colour.r
    output_colour.g = 1 - input_colour.g
    output_colour.b = 1 - input_colour.b

This pseudocode is actually very similar to what you would write if you were implementing this in a real fragment shader. You write code that is only concerned with outputting a single pixel, the CPU tells the GPU to run it once over your input image, and the GPU runs it once for every pixel in the output

This sort of task is ideal for a GPU because you will always end up with the same output image for an input *regardless of the order the pixels are processed in*. The GPU can safely divide these thousands or millions of tiny tasks across all of its many, many cores

**Example 2:**

Now let's look at something that a GPU would be very bad at. Let's say for some reason you want to run through the pixels in the input image row by row, and for each one output the average of all the pixels that came before it. This would be simple to write for the CPU:

    num_pixels_seen = 0
    total_colour_value = colour(0, 0, 0)
    for x, y, input_colour in input_image:
        total_colour_value += input_colour
        num_pixels_seen += 1
        output[x, y] = total_colour_value / num_pixels_seen

However, you can't really write this as a shader, because you can't parallelise it. Each pixel relies on the output pixel directly to its left, which relies on the output pixel directly to *its* left, and so on. We have to process the first pixel, then the second, then the third etc. until we've done the full image, so you can only use one core at a time to run this program. CPUs are designed to be very good at this sort of thing - processing lots of elements of a data set one by one in a specific order

**So, going back to the scrolling example:**

To scroll in the way you're describing, you would have to take the output of the previous frame and render it again at a new offset on the screen. All your shader program needs to do is work out which pixel to read from the previous frame based on the old scroll offset, the new scroll offset and the on-screen position of the pixel it's currently outputting.

Conditionals do not work by magic, they work by evaluating an expression and comparing it with 0. So their execution speed obviously depends on the time it takes to evaluate the expression.

In practice, the compiler will often optimize trivial (and some non-trivial) things away, and caching, OOO execution, speculation, vector instructions and so on make the above comparsions rather wrong in many cases.

From a theoretic perspective, your ""time complexity"" is a formal definition which is independent of actual runtime, actual machines etc. It also ignores constant factors.

That way the compound condition can often check just 1 condition and fail (i.e., it will “fail fast”). For compound conditions involving ||, put the one that succeeds more often first, so this decision can also often be made after just 1 check. This technique is called “short circuiting” if you want to learn more.

Regarding the result of an operation as a condition, try to avoid making performing the same operation needlessly. In your example, rather than compute 31/2 every time, store 31/2 in a constant earlier in the code and then refer to the constant. That way the computer performs the division only once. The technique of “memoization” includes ideas like this.

Finally, you might explore writing code that times how long it takes to perform blocks of your code. You can take multiple measurements of how long an implementation takes, then refactor and measure again to make comparisons of code speed. (Beware that sometimes CPUs cache code and results, so that can muddy your attempts to take measurements.)

Generally the use of constant operations will only really affect true runtime but not scalability with data (which complexity represents)

So for instance (I'm about to give bad programming advice, please don't apply broadly as it will make your code very hard to read) if you minimised the number of variable assignments and did as much in a single line that you could you would save quite a few operations overall. An example might be

Define window(list L){
  L=copy(L)

    X=L[0]
    Y=L[1]

  }

Edit: Reddit hates code and this won't show properly

This difference would make a minor effect on run time as it would reduce the amount of saving and loading of variables

There are lots of other things you can do for constant level savings (like flipping an if statement around depending on whether the if or else block is more common.

To answer your original question though

Provided the individual operations in the if statement don't scale as input size grows then they don't affect complexity

Arithmetic in conditions will also generally not affect complexity unless again there's a scaling based on input size however in terms of actual run time they would compared with not doing them.

To understand you kind of need to know what's involved in different operations but essentially

If X==1

Vs if (X+32/3>=1)

The == is a single assembly level (what most coding languages turn into before becoming zeros and ones) operation

Greater than or equal to Is usually two operations (as would be <, >, or <=)

Addition is one operation

Division is... More complex, let's pretend the result is a whole number and you don't care about remainders then you can call it two operations

This is ignoring the need to move the values between registers (a kind of temporary variable to hold any value being used in an operation) which would add another two operations per task

So in total X==1 is 1 operation (3 if you count the registers)
Whereas (X+32/3>=1) is 5 operations (11 if you count register assignment)

So the condition with Arithmetic is maybe 3-4 times longer to compute but it's really more about doing more stuff than about Arithmetic specifically.

Generally speaking for the kinds of things most people choose you never need to worry about this as really computers are power houses these days

The reason this doesn't affect complexity though is that complexity is about the (for big O complexity) the upper bound of behaviour as input size grows.

For instance, code which calculated the sum of a list of numbers would scale linearly as that list grew (if you double the list size you double the time to complete) whereas the constant operations used in that don't really change the way it scales, they just change the true run time (e.g. maybe you have millions of elements to sum and one fewer operation could still save you time but doesn't cancel out that there's still millions to look at)

Complexity is usually more important as it gets you changing different aspects of code (usually changing the overall algorithm to suit the problem rather than fiddling with individual operations)

As an example, if we both wanted to find Rear Admiral Grace Hopper in the list of all humans who've ever lived and you could read twice as fast as me, it wouldn't matter at all if you started from the very start but I skipped to where I though H began and then I skipped to where I thought Ho, and kept skipping until I was very close to Grace Hopper",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1630721336.0

The three biggest things for me are:

* Make sure there's no glare on the screen.  I know tons of natural light is good for the spirit but if my screens have glare from a window behind me or whatever it wrecks my eyes by the end of the day.
* Similarly, I have to make sure there's not too much brightness contrast between my screen and the area surrounding it.  For me, that means don't back the monitor up against an open window.  The bright light around the edge of the monitor strains my eyes by the end of the day.  If you have to deal with this situation, try to match screen brightness closer to the stuff around it.  So maybe turn off dark mode and turn up the screen brightness.

You can use API's that abstract away the fact that data is compressed - but it will incur some overhead behind the scenes. If you know you will read the same data several times, it might make more sense to decompress it once then work on it several times rather than decompress it every time it is accessed.

Another example is a case where you will read randomly from compressed data. It might make more sense to decompress all of the data into memory to enable fast random access, rather than incur the overhead of decompressing before every random read.

Another example is a case where you want fast random access across all of your data, but your data is too big to fit in memory. If it fits in memory compressed, you may see benefits from putting compressed data in memory and decompressing on the fly.

Fun fact, some operating systems even compress data in memory transparently to the user/program, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory_compression.",6,0,0,0,6,False,False,False,1630557478.0
pg70sn,hbbd9l5,t3_pg70sn,"Ok so the simple answer is that machines can only read bytes at the lowest which is 8 bit. So when you compress you can actually parse stuff into bits and save a password to decode it later.

You can run a generalized algorithm that parses according to some previous observations fx: [http://www.thiagi.com/instructional-puzzles-original/2015/2/13/cryptograms](http://www.thiagi.com/instructional-puzzles-original/2015/2/13/cryptograms)

But usually you would like to scan your files and look for the most occurring patterns and then assign them to the lowest possible bit. 1 or 11 or 011 or 101 and so on. This way you can always know when the bit string will end because it will end in a signal bit.

Now that you have mapped all the words/letters/numbers/whatever to bits you create a password/alphabet you can later use to decrypt the compression.

Now as you can imagine this process can't be easily skipped. Since all compressed files(usually) have a unique password/alphabet. So running compressed files directly seems almost needlessly hard to implement.

also remember the lowest readable piece of data is a byte which is 8bit, but a compressed file is a string of bits, not bytes.

Edit: To elaborate on the string of bits. The most commonly used letter in the English alphabet is ""E"" which is ""0100 0101"" in bit. Take those 8 bit and make them into 1 by parsing them into a new byte like this: ""1000 0000"" then you can store ""EEEEEEE"" like this: ""1111 1110"" and have a null byte to signal terminate string.

Because this theorem is rather hard to understand, and requires some machinery (in particular, a universal Turing machine), one typically does not present the halting problem proof shown in this answer when introducing the halting problem. Rather, one uses the proof you gave in the post.

The actual problems are twofold: First, programs usually have inputs. While this is not necessary, for didactic reasons you should not suddenly stop talking about the input to a program.

The second, and much larger problem, is that `deceive` references itself. It is a function which has access to its own source code. Remember that the halting problem is for Turing machines, where code is not data, and hence programs can not access or manipulate their own source code.

A lot of times the installer isn’t compiling on your machine, especially in Windows. You’re getting the binaries, but the installer is just setting up the environment.

As a note, you seem to be mistaken on how compilation / binary works. Binary is not OS dependent, it is the most universally understood computer “language”.

These can't be ""copied over"" per say as it's possible one machine might have different lower level instructions. 

Then there are high level languages, these are compiled or interpreted (essentially converted) into a low level version of themselves which can run on a specific operating system (which sits on top of the cpu). 

I can write something high level in python, and have the same code run on different systems because there are compilers/interpreters which convert them to the operating systems specific code - all the while taking advantage of operating system specific features like storing data in ""AppData"" for windows - linux has it's own nuances. 

Discord, Slack, etc are all high level applications, they are specifically designed to work on top of the main OS - windows, linux, ios etc. You can copy files from one windows machine, to another, and have it work - assuming you have moved all the corresponding files (eg not just the stuff in ""program files"" - but held elsewhere on the operating system or registry) but trying to do the same for windows to linux isn't really possible without using some kind of interpreter to convert what is currently stored over to the new operating systems.

So the long and short of it is, it's much easier to just think of them as different applications across different operating systems and you will have an easier time. 

tl;dr: different cpus have different instruction sets. OSs are designed to communicate between the program and the cpu.

Formally speaking, strong consistency is a guarantee that all observers agree on the ordering of all the data accesses in the database. Some databases allow this ordering to be different than the ordering as seen by the clients. Example. A client enters two transactions, A and B. It's possible that a strongly consistent system returns these transactions in the order B and A.

So strong consistency itself doesn't guarantee the intuitive order as presumed by the client, which is why the [strict consistency](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs551/CourseNotes/Consistency/TypesConsistency.html) model was introduced, which guarantees that these orderings also follow physical time order.

**[Eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)** 
 
 >Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. Eventual consistency, also called optimistic replication, is widely deployed in distributed systems, and has origins in early mobile computing projects. A system that has achieved eventual consistency is often said to have converged, or achieved replica convergence.

pdc4en,hap2u63,t3_pdc4en,"Computing power doesn't scale the same way that storage does. You cannot connect a bunch of computers together and make bigger computer that works faster for general everyday use. However, you can connect a bunch of computers together and see significant speed gains for some types of highly parallelizable, computationally expensive problems.

The question is, do you have a problem that is large and parallelizable enough that would benefit from being used in such a system? It won't be worth doing unless you can still see speed gains after factoring in the cost of breaking the problem into smaller units, distributing all the necessary information among all the computers, receiving the results, and assembling it into the final output.

A good example is raytracing for 3D animation: the assets (i.e., the scene, character models, and textures) are generally pretty small, but the computations are very expensive. It can take hours to complete a single frame of animation. Say you're making a CG movie that renders at about 5 hours per frame. On one computer, you would get 1 frame every 5 hours. However, if you had each of your 10 computers work on a frame, the cost of distributing the assets would be miniscule compared to the savings you get from having 10 frames completed in 5 hours.

A bad example is video games. Sure, the principles behind video games are similar to the raytracer example, and you could probably devise a system where each of your 10 computers is responsible for handling some component of the game. However, there still has to be some main computer that the player is interacting with. The latency introduced by having the main computer communicate with the others would overshadow any savings you got by parallelizing the game, and the game would be unbearably slow.",87,0,0,0,87,False,False,False,1630167000.0

How you choose to split up problems in a parallel computing environment is a major consideration. My suspicion is that splitting a raytracing problem at the ray level instead of the frame level is too granular, and I am further suspicious that doing so would be too slow to be worth it. I doubt a single ray is very expensive to calculate, which means that the computer responsible for a ray may spend more time preparing itself for calculation than actually doing it, and would probably leave a significant amount of CPU and GPU capacity unused.

Having said that, I would totally buy it if someone involved in optics or materials science or whatever said that ray-level granularity is appropriate for advanced, detailed simulations of light traveling through some specialized plastic fiber-optic material.

* You have to slow down if you want to go fast.

* You can't get to where you're going until you understand where you're at.

* You're building a house. Do you want a foundation of sand, or cement? 

* Form a study group, 4-6 people (not more), 4 hours a day, every day. No chit chat, no phones, no snacks - only water, no distractions. The only conversation that should be happening is about the lesson material in front of you. Kick out and replace members who can't comply. You are all there to hold each other accountable, just by being there. Read. Get homework done. Write a paper. Whatever it is, you don't have to all do the same thing, and you don't have to all do it together. Help each other when asked, and take turns helping. Have a whiteboard handy.

* Sit in the front of the class. The front of the class has the best view of the material and the teacher, and controls the pace of the class. Those who sit up front are the ones the teacher is paying attention to. When you're sitting there with a corkscrew face going, ""Huh?"", that feedback informs the professor. Yes, he may call on you more often. GOOD. No one cares about how you answer the question, no one can be bothered to judge you. The teacher isn't looking for you to get it right - you're not being graded for answering the question, he's looking for feedback to see if he's doing his job. If you can't answer the question, GIVE HIM THAT FEEDBACK.

* Learn by teaching. If you can't explain it to someone else, then you don't understand it yourself. Explain your subject matter to your mother until she understands it. Help your study group by going over the lecture material at the white board - emulate a professor.

* Make friends with those who sit in the front of the class. They're the smartest kids there, the most eager, the most ambitious. Make your study group with them. The cool kids in the back are losers who will just drag you down. No cool kids. It's not about cool factor. This isn't high school.

* Talk to your TA's and professors after every class. You guys should be on a first name basis. Go to office hours, ask questions about the material you're struggling with. Come with something that showed you tried.

* Schedule your day. Get a daily planner. Stick to the schedule. You don't need breaks, you need sleep. Otherwise, keep studying. Breaks and snacking turn into escapism. This is why you need a schedule. Schedule meals and breaks so that you're accountable and they're visible. If you take breaks arbitrarily, your time will fly and you will have nothing to show for it.

* Journal, or keep a log. You need notes about your progress. Figure out a format that makes sense for you. This is - in part, another accountability thing. You can also use it to show your professor a record of your effort and your progress. When he sees it, call them notes. Journaling is also a medium in which you think to yourself, it makes you commit to the abstract notions in your mind - forcing them to become concrete by writing them down. Write about what you're learning about and what you think about it. Admit you don't understand something and ponder it in your journal. Mix in some bullet points and plans of action. This helps structure and discipline your mind. Don't just pick a journaling time, keep an open document and add to it throughout the day. Maybe make it a major part of your breaks.

* Cry a little bit. This is some of the hardest you will work in your life. Expect to cry a little bit. Then accept that this is all part of the process, no one is dying, it's just a grade, you can retake courses - and no one will judge you for it, and then get back on that pony.

* If you're already failing, you need to schedule a talk with your professor about it as soon as you can get him. You need to tell him you realize where you are and need help understanding where you might possibly end up. Accept now that you might just have to retake a course.

Not necessarily without rotations, but definitely at most O(log n). You should just think about where to place the smaller one in order to cause the ""least trouble"" to the new parent. But, as maybe the node in the ""best place"" might have two children already, you'll need to extract some node from the tree and relocate it to aid with the merging.

pbew6d,hac7mdp,t3_pbew6d,"A long while ago I solved the problem of a fast and memory efficient trie in Java by using just three arrays to represent the trie and no objects or hash tables at all. I dug out the comment I wrote to explain my own code for you:

    /*
     * A node is indexed by an int, and it's properties stored in three arrays, 
     * nodeFirstChild[], nodeNextSibling[] and nodeLabel[]. An index of 0 represents
     * the null index.
     * 
     * The children of a node are represented by a linked list - the head of a node n's
     * children is nodeFirstChild[n], and then the next member of the list is accessed
     * from nodeNextSibing[].
     * 
     * nodeLabel[] is the letter at that node. A letter of '-' is used as an end of 
     * marker.

    int[] nodeNextSibling;
    char[] nodeLabel;
    int rootNode = 1;

So to search it at a node you run along the linked list of siblings looking for a match, referencing the label array. If you match, use the first array to go down a level from that node.

So the array values would be as in the tables below. You have a pointer that tells you the next sibling in a linked list to search for whether the current term matches. And then if you find a match you use the other array to tell you what node to go to next and start with its first sibling. You look up the values with a double pointer, so that each string only needs to be in memory once. And finally you keep track of accept states so that you don't accidentally match a substring of what should match. Every lookup in the array is of course super fast, no hash table needed.

If you were being really fancy you could collapse matching branches. But that makes maintaining the tree much harder.

Another consideration is how big to make your arrays. The classical answer is to double them in size every time they run out of room, but at a certain size you might not want to be doing that. But finding an approach that works for the kind of size of data you are talking about shouldn't be hard.

paimzm,ha5386p,t3_paimzm,"So modern CPUs are electric circuits and I’ll introduce a few concepts first

Voltage: voltage is a physical quantity which you can think of as the electrical analogue to pressure. Each point in 3d space has its own voltage at any time and all points connected by a continuous conductive path such as a wire are at the same voltage.

Power rails: the power rails are generated by the power supply, one is the ground wire, which carries a voltage of 0 which represents digital 0. The other is the positive wire which carries a voltage higher than 0 which represents digital 1. These are distributed all throughout the CPU.

Signals: these are wires which carry a time varying voltage, they could be low or high at any given time.

Transistors: a transistor is an electrically controlled electrical switch. It has 3 terminals, a voltage at one of the terminals controls whether or not the other 2 are electrically connected. Multiple transistors can be controlled by the same signal wire.

Logic gate: this is an arrangement of transistors which performs some logical function such as and/or/not on its input signals and outputs the result on its output signals. For example a not gate can be made by having a transistor switch the output wire to the ground power rail when the input wire is high and another transistor switch it to the positive power rail when the input wire is low.

Clock: the clock is another wire which carries a voltage generated by a physical device called an oscillator which is constantly alternating between 0 and 1. This too is distributed all throughout the cpu.

Memory cell: this stores a single bit of information for later use. On each rising edge of the clock signal the value of the input wire is stored, and on each falling edge of the clock signal, this value is reflected on the output wire. These too can be made by special arrangements of transistors. Registers and RAM are made of these.

Inputs/outputs: these are additional digital signal wires coming from input devices such as mouses/keyboards and additional output wires going to devices such as monitors.

So how’s it all work?

At the beginning of each clock cycle, the outputs of the memory cells and inputs of the CPU propagate through the network of logic gates, switching various signal wires to the low or high power rails, the final results find themselves back at the inputs of the memory cells and the outputs of the CPU. The results are stored in the memory cells and the whole thing happens again on the next cycle. It’s one big sequential state machine.

To answer your question about the endless chain, it’s a loop.

The inputs, memory cells and power rails control the logic gates.

The logic gates, power rails and clock control the memory cells and outputs.

The clock ultimately drives this endless loop of processing in the logic gates and storing in the memory cells.

If you want to study this in more depth you could start with the abstract theoretical side:

Digital logic: describes how you can take basic logic gates and memory cells and combine them to create more complex building blocks and functionality

Computer architecture: describes how you can take the building blocks from digital logic and create cpus and memory systems

Assembly programming: this is the end goal of it all, to create a circuit which can perform the basic  functionality of a computer which you’ll learn here

As for real world implementation:

Electromagnetism: the physics behind circuits

Circuits: self explanatory

Semiconductors: the physics of transistors

There are many more components to a computer, for example the hard drive, which has a different physical principle and is treated as an input/output device rather than a fundamental component.

And I’ll end by saying that circuits and transistors are not the only way to achieve digital logic in the real world, you could use relays, gears, vacuum tubes or really anything that allows you to construct networks of logic gates.",9,0,0,0,9,False,False,False,1629796234.0
paimzm,ha53jzj,t3_paimzm,"If I am understanding your question correctly, you are asking where does the initial information come from, to trigger the very big chain of digital electronics that will give the result to the user.

The answer is, it is stored in the hard drive of a computer. If you want to run a program (basically a sequence of bits) you have to store it in the hard drive first, then load it into the ram, and the ram will feed it into the processor that will do its magic. 

In earlier times, you could literally hard code a program's 0 and 1 into a magnetic tape and put it into the computer by hand. 

Also there is the case of rom memory, which feeds some data (instructions) to the processor during the computer start-up. This data is hard coded into the rom (that's why it is called read-only) by the manufacturer. The rom is basically like a very big lookup table, or you can think of it like a mathematical function from {0, 1}\^m -> {0,1}\^n.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1629796525.0

When the clock ticks the registers copy their current input to their output and hold it stable until the next clock tick.

So ""who controls bits(electricity) in each unit be on and off"" is the current output state of the CPU/registers.

For example: if the current state of the registers is that the next operation is to add register A to register B's output and store the result in register X, that makes the CPUs arithmetic unit (a small circuit that can do some basic math operations) read A and B and output the result of their addition to the input of register X. This takes some time to happen and propagate, so the clock speed is chosen such that the slowest operation the CPU supports always finishes within one clock cycle. CPU designers avoid supporting operations that are too complex and would take too long to propagate throughout the circuit, requiring a slower clock, as those can usually be replaced by a series of simpler operations anyway.",2,0,0,0,2,False,False,False,1629799483.0

pa6i0q,ha3knfq,t3_pa6i0q,"It's not reall that hard, once you know the theory. Our university's compiler course basically consists of you implementing a (basic) C compiler in C++. Of course, C++ is significantly harder to compile than C. However, this just means that you should stick to writing your compiler in a simpler language so that you can later compile it more easy.

Writing lexers and (LL) parsers is actually rather mechanical and a task I find fun (I have weird hobbies, I know). Coming up with a type system for your language (trust me, you will want one) and implementing a type checker is anywhere between a textbook algorithm (ie algorithm W), something a bit more involved (inheritance?) or something undecidable (Java, surprisingly..).

Writing the backend also is easy, as long as you don't care about optimizations: Just translate by recusing on the AST.

If you want to feel like your compiler is completely freestanding, use x86 as a backend (or ARM, or RISCV, or whatever architecture you use). You will still want to output plaintext assembly, to be assembled using an assembler of your choice. If you want to learn a useful skill that will significantly help you if you ever want to do anything involving a compiler again, choose LLVM as a backend.

The fun exercise when trying to write a simple compiler that can compile itself is figuring out a language that makes writing a compiler easy without that language being hard to compile.

Functional languages need GC, while plain C makes switching over AST structures a pain. I guess you may want something similar to unsafe, simplified Rust, where you are still writing C-like code managing its own memory, while having first-class support for switching over inductively defined datatypes. This at least seems like a reasonable middle-ground language to me.

I think you are talking about the general case where the input doesn't have to be one hot. I think I agree in that case, but still not sure because there are bit twiddling tricks that isolate the lsb (rightmost ON/HOT/SET/HIGH bit) of a binary sequence in O(1) (\`b & \~(b - 1)\` zeroes everything out except for the lsb) and maybe this can be used somehow to get a really fast algo. Just a gut feeling.

\---

On the other hand, I am now wondering if there can be a O(lgN) algorithm that binary searches for the single 1 IF we assume the input is one-hot.

    # Assuming one_hot is a power of two equal to 2 ** e, finds e.
    # Precondition: one_hot is a power of two.
    def find_position(one_hot):
        # Initially there is no upper bound. We indicate this with r == None.
        l, r = 0, None
        # Initial guess: guess that one_hot == 1 << 7 == 2 ** 7
        g = 7
        g_val = 1 << 7
        while g_val != one_hot:
            if g_val < one_hot:
                l = g + 1
            else: # g_val > one_hot:
                r = g - 1
            if r is None:
                g <<= 1 # double the guess
            else:
                g = (l + r) >> 1 # guess the midpoint between l and r
            g_val = 1 << g
        return g
    
    # Tests
    for e in range(100):
        assert(find_position(1 << e) == e)

If we consider \`1 << g\` to be O(1), then the entire algorithm runs in O(lgN) where N == e. But if we consider \`1 << g\` to be O(g), then the algorithm runs at like O(N).

\---

Going back to the general case where the binary sequence can have more than one ON/HOT/SET/HIGH bit, we could find the positions of the SET bits as follows:

    def find_positions(num):
        positions = []
        while num: # len(positions) iterations
            lsb = num & ~(num - 1) # isolate the lsb
            # lsb is one_hot
            position = find_position(lsb) # O(lg(position)) assuming 1 << g is O(1) instead of O(g)
            positions.append(position)
            num &= (num - 1) # zero out the lsb
        return positions

The while loop has L iterations where L == len(positions) == the count of SET bits in num. Each iteration runs in O(lg(position)) == O(lgN) (N is the maximum position, so O(lgN) is the worst case). Therefore the entire thing runs in O(L \* lgN)  which for many cases will be much smaller than O(N), especially if the binary sequence is sparse (i.e. L << N). Ofc, this whole thing hinges on \`1 << g\` being O(1) instead of O(g).

Edit: A previous version of this replay had the following incorrect sentence. ""M is the position of the MSB of num, which implies that M is on the order of lgN where N is the bit length of num."" What's incorrect about this is that if M is the positions of the MSB of num, then M is on the order of lg(num), not lgN. Indeed if M is defined this way, then M == N.

p97tg1,h9wkjds,t1_h9wjre4,"TLDR: BDD is a SWE practice, not a computer science principle.

BDD/TDD is firmly in the realm of SWE, i.e. tools to support the development of software. This isn't a compsci topic *per se*, and doesn't involve any computer science formally. It's a best practice thing, and in my realm of bioinformatics, only highly mature suites/tools/algorithms have comprehensive test suites, let alone any hint of a BDD development style. BDD doesn't guarantee success, and similarly, it's absence does not preclude the use of tools that don't conform to it's dogma.

I've been developing software for the last 10 years, and I've never taken an undergraduate or graduate course in compsci that would mention or emphasize the importance of a testing style like TDD. TDD and BDD practices vary by institution/company and it doesn't *always* lead to better quality code.

One motivation behind different partitioning processes is to reduce the likelihood of a worst case scenario where pivot is the largest / smallest element.

Sometimes this involves randomly picking multiple elements and choosing the median as the pivot. We can even use k pivots to partition the array into (k + 1) sections.

p7nprt,h9lwosu,t3_p7nprt,"There really are a lot of answers to this question as I'm sure you can see from the comments.  Depending on what kind of code you're dealing with, computers ""understand"" it in a variety of ways.

At the very lowest level, there is binary code.  The computer ""understands"" this by sending each bit of the code through the processor as either a high-voltage or low-voltage signal.  The machinery inside the processor then processes these using what are essentially convoluted configurations of transistors.  Every processor is built to interpret certain instructions, which make up its *instruction set*.

The level above that is assembly language.  While binary code is stored in zeroes and ones, assembly programs are at least somewhat human readable.  However they still have basically a 1:1 correspondence with the binary instruction set.  A computer ""understands"" these by reading the assembly program line by line, resolving a few memory locations and such, and packing them into binary code so that they can be executed.

From there it really goes all over the place.  Some languages, like C, are *compiled*, meaning there is a program that reads them and converts them into binary code to be executed.

In this series he builds a simple 8 bit computer from simple components.  During this you will come to understand how machine code works.

All programming languages first started out as machine code.  Somebody was back when sat down and wrote tge first assembly language using machine code.  Somebody then came along and used assembly language to develop a higher level language like C. Then C was used to develop languages like python.  

When higher languages are compiled they are being translated into machine code. Some languages require that the program be compiled before you run it.  Python does the translation from python code to machine code at run time.",14,0,0,0,14,False,False,False,1629457973.0
p7nprt,h9l1suw,t3_p7nprt,"Compilers. They test for syntax, lexic and semantic. If the code pass to these 3 algorithms, you have a code that is readable by the machine. The code result from the compilers will be mount in a data structure (like a tree) that the language can run through it and understand it easily. 

For machine language, like Assembly, you are using a language very close to the functions that a CPU has and understand, so the conversion is much more simple: basically map 1:1 the assembly command to the correspond binary sequence understood by the machine.

Edit. Reading OP comments, just want to add to give more insight 

A CPU is a piece of hardware that is very good at counting. It does it very fast and precisely. It works consiste of counting from binaries data saved in memory. Binaries are number represent in base 2. E.g you may represent a space in memory as the value 12. If this is the last space used on the memory, the CPU will calculate the next free space (which would be 13), so the CPU increase this number and save it on memory. That's all about the base theory for computers: count binary data saved in memory. (That is why you call computer of computers, because they count! They count-puter hehe). The binary that saved in memory is a numerical representation for our real problems! 

There is one last piece for this puzzle: Automata & formal language. I'm calling automata here, but I'm not sure about the name. But I will describe here so you understand what it is or someone correct me the name. Automata is a algorithm that describe what a computer or computer language can understant. It's basically a function that receive a input (e.g a binary data) and tells if that binary will be accept and understood by the machine or not. That means, it describe all the 'words' a computer will understand. That is how a compilers can tell if you misspelled a keyword by the language you are using. There are a lot of CS theory to develop a language. This will be applied even for a binary language! Now that you defined how your language will be, you can map the 'words' with functions. This functions can be the low level language (machine language) or a Python function mapping a C functions.",23,0,0,1,23,False,False,False,1629408791.0

You can even have a couple of them loop back on each other in such a way that it can be set to always output a charge or to never output a charge without having to rewire anything. This is called a flip flop.  It can be used to make CPU registers so that the computer can remember things and use the previous outputs as inputs to the next operation.

Python works similarly, but in a simulation: The Python program simulates a type of computer called a stack machine.

p7nprt,h9mecje,t3_p7nprt,"The 0s and 1s are literally translated to on/off input sequences to the CPU chip. Different processors (like AMD vs Intel) have different specifications, and the same combination of 0s and 1s that makes sense to an AMD chip will not make sense to an Intel chip. This is referred to as binary input.

The ""higher"" you go away from the chip, the more human-readable the instructions become. After 0s and 1s there is Assembly, which essentially provides common shortcut commands for actual sequences of 0s and 1s for things like ""remember this"" and ""multiply this by that"" etc. that are specific to the processor type.  This lets a developer interact with any chip type (AMD or Intel) using the same commands, and translates those commands into the appropriate combination of 0s and 1s appropriate for the type of chip.

On top of that is C, which introduces logical concepts and control structures like loops and variables, as well as making it easy to import code from other people who have already solved common issues, like showing stuff on a screen and sending data to a printer. Above that is everything else. 

You may have heard the term ""compile"", which refers to translating instructions (code) from a higher-level language like C to the lowest level language, binary aka 0s and 1s -- and if you are understanding so far, you will deduce that the same C program compiled into AMD binary code will be different than the Intel binary code! 

You may wonder ""hmm the same EXE file in Windows works no matter the chip"" and that is true, because EXE files are not true binaries but rather Windows executables, where Windows actually interprets instructions from the program to the chipset on the fly! (no wonder all the slowness and crashes, right!? :) )

Also note that the terms higher-level and lower-level are relative... even binary 0s and 1s are technically higher-level than the actual electrical impulses they represent... and though I refer to C here as higher-level than binary and assembly, C is actually considered a low-level language because so many other languages were actually programmed using C! So, common languages like JavaScript and PHP AND Python are high-level languages, and C is relatively low-level compared to them!

""Automata and formal language"" is the name of the theory that study the process of creating computer languages. There are a lot of terms and ideas around computer language. I got an example from wiki, just so you can have an idea that the rabbit hole for the theory is very deep:

""A formal grammar that contains left recursion cannot be parsed by a LL(k)-parser or other naive recursive descent parser unless it is converted to a weakly equivalent right-recursive form. In contrast, left recursion is preferred for LALR parsers because it results in lower stack usage than right recursion.""

You probably may not get what is writing above but I will give one example for context.

You may create a language that the computer will only understand if the words are symmetric (the automata algorithm would only recognize symmetric words):

See that I'm using binary, so you can understand that a language can be made for machine only use.

    0101 - ok, because 01|01
    0110 - not ok, because 01|10
    010010 - ok, because 010|010
    011101 - not ok, 011|101 

So, every symmetric word the computer would understand, which could give a infinite number of words for this language. You may use later the word '0101' for this language to map some specific function when the CPU reads it.

This may be a fictional example, but it works very close to that.

p79wtb,h9i9avx,t3_p79wtb,"Data is just information. It can be browsing history to use to more accurately suggest search results the person is interested in. It can be information about how likely someone is to pay a loan back or how likely they are to fall through. It can be how often they are in car accidents to predict their risk in car insurance. It can be the items people buy on a weekly shop (if they buy cat food, they probably have cats, so you can then target cat-care products at them more successfully). Companies like Elliptic use data about distribution of cryptocurrency transactions within the blockchain to attempt to detect laundering and thus infer the likelihood that a crypto payment is funded by illicit activity.

Data is literally anything you can use to make suggestions or potential correlations to other information, facts, trends, or anything. It entirely depends on the company you work with. Fintech and insurance is going to massively differ to that for a massive supermarket chain, and that is going to differ to companies like Facebook, Google, Netflix who are more focused on making the content of their platforms more relevant to each individual using it.

Pretty much anything where you can make assumptions about something else using information.

Like, example. You work for BP or Shell, you can infer that someone drives an HGV by the fact that they repeatedly refuel with 100L of diesel  fuel each week. You can then target other products and offers towards them more suited to HGV drivers, such as food, drink, and money off future transactions to reward them being a regular returning customer. Doing this makes the likelihood of such campaigns much more likely to provide a positive additional income for the company as opposed to targeting a 70 year old who only gets petrol for their lawn mower once a month, where it would be less likely to be cost beneficial to invest in.

Data can also be used in security. You can make preemptive predictions that a DDoS attack is ramping up by analysing transactions-per-minute in a system. This needs to be carefully compared to just regular spikes in transactions that occur throughout the day or week (e.g. a bank is more likely to get internet banking traffic around 12pm each day rather than 12am). Doing so allows you to lock down certain gateways to protect vital services ahead of time before you get an outage. In fact, Cloudflare does this already.

I've worked on projects before where we used data regarding the electricity draw of household appliances to attempt to monitor the power supply to houses to help detect things like thermostats in refrigerators malfunctioning, which increases yearly energy bills and contributes to the climate crisis.

p6oybv,h9fhd5b,t3_p6oybv,"The term ""architecture"" in computer hardware can be a bit confusing because it can mean a number of different things, on different levels (as u/suckmacaque06 said).

The von Neumann architecture describes a rather general structure of a computer that all current computers (that I know of) follow. It doesn't go into the details of a CPU at all. It doesn't even tell what a CPU is capable of in terms of the code it can run.

Then there's something called an instruction set architecture, which defines the kinds of data types, registers visible to programs etc. that a CPU knows, and the kinds of instructions the CPU can execute and how they behave. This is what you'd write or generate machine code for. Examples of instruction set architectures would be x86, the 64-bit x86-64, or the ARM instruction set architectures. The ISA defines the external functionality of a CPU and what kind of code the CPU can be expected to be able to execute.

The AMD Zen would be an example of what's often called a microarchitecture, and it's basically a vendor-specific general design of *how* a particular physical CPU implements its instruction set architecture. The microarchitecture is internal to the CPU in the sense that regardless of microarchitecture, for example a specific instruction from the x86-64 instruction set should still get you the same result and behave the same way whether you run it on a processor with Zen microarchitecture, an older AMD CPU that has a different design, or an Intel CPU that might have an entirely different internal design. However, the microarchitecture can have significant effects on the performance of a CPU, which is why there's a big buzz when a CPU company announces or starts using a new promising one.",5,0,0,1,5,False,False,False,1629306927.0
p6oybv,h9ff49c,t3_p6oybv,"In the sense of your original question, it is a modified Von Neumann, but so are all x86 CPUs.    


Von Neumann, IIRC, just indicates that the Programs and Data storage share the same memory space, unlike the Harvard Architecture which essentially had a ""Program"" and ""Data"" storage separately.  


As noted above, This is more a minor technical & marketing scheme.  An 8088/8086, 286, 386, 486, Pentium, iSeries on the Intel side of things indicate various evolutions of this general design.    


One thing to note, is that the modern systems aren't ""pure"" Von Neumann, however, as the NX Bit/Flag (No Excecute) provided a way to mark data as ""data only"" (and not as a ""program""), that is, it created a sort of hybrid Von Neumann/Harvard Architecture, that helps prevent data from being executed (and thus a source of an exploit).  A pure Von Neumann architecture that doesn't do that would allow random data to be executed like a program.  


Anyways, AMD chips, whether K6, Athlons, Threadrippers, Zen what have you are also, because they're modified x86 chips, also feature similar technologies and architectures.  


In the end, the features added over the years (whether MMX (another marketing term for Intel's version of ""Single Instruction Multiple Data"" features - or ""Vector"" processing). or other enhancesments through the years, also play a role.

Generalizing this, if you can fit an odd number of points inside 2R the circle will be centered on a point, and if an even number of points then the circle will be in the middle of 4 points in the grid.

You’re likely familiar with the math necessary to describe a straight line in 2D space: ‘y = mx + b’. If you were a program, you could be given the parameters of this equation and be able to reproduce the line that it describes.

Diving deeper: higher power Bézier curves are more complicated than a simple line and allow for more intricate shapes. A vector graphics program like Adobe illustrator provides “bezier handles” that you can visually manipulate to adjust the parameters of the curve you’re trying to describe. It does all of the math for you in the background and when the image is saved, what it’s saving is all of the parameters and math that describes the image. When opened by a program that can interpret this data, the exact same shape(s) can be reproduced. 

Additionally, because these shapes are represented by math and not pixels, linear scaling can be applied to these mathematical parameters to “theoretically infinite” scales without loss of detail in how the image is described. So a program can reproduce the image at any given scale and “zoom in” infinitely and it will be able to show finer and finer detail ‘endlessly’.

In practice there could be limitations in the scalability due to floating point precision capabilities of the software but that’s another discussion and unrelated to the soundness of the mathematics that describe the image.",20,0,0,0,20,False,False,False,1629061216.0

If the book is from 2013, consider that that was around Python 3.3/3.4 era, and that anything that you’d want to teach to students almost certainly is not relevant in newer Python versions (we are currently on 3.9). I have a feeling you might be talking about “Learning Python” 5th Edition, by Mark Lutz. If so, that book will be just fine for teaching.

As far as a language goes, I highly recommend sticking with Python. Consider the following scenarios:
- Your students walk in on the first day. You tell them to download Python. CPython installs, along with IDLE, a place that Python can be run. You tell your students to open IDLE, and can immediately start instructing them on programming. Or…
- Your students walk in on the first day. You’d like to start teaching them JavaScript, but instead you first need to teach them how HTML works and what script tags are, and how browsers work, unless you plan to set them up with a runtime environment for JS. 


Even then, JavaScript can be weird. Imagine trying to explain to kids with no programming experience how = is different from == is different from ===. Without first explaining how JavaScript is a weakly typed language, the difference between == and === is going to make no sense. Even then, explaining data types is going to be a little harder in both Python and JS, as they are both dynamically typed. My first language was C++, and the transition to Python and other languages from there was a breeze because I had been “raised” with a static, strongly-typed language.

Generally speaking, I consider C to be the best intro programming language, not because it's easy but because its the basis of most modern languages and its close enough to the hardware that it gives a more intuitive understanding of what's going on behind the scenes. Also it's important to use a compiler manually and not hide everything with an IDE.

(this argument could also apply to a raspberry pi with one of those electronics kits, but that involves a lot of other variables and funding)

Someone mentioned the difference between setting up Python and IDLE vs learning about HTML to get started and it's an important consideration but because any computers in a school's computer lab surely have a browser installed already, there's nothing to install to get started. Fire up the browser, press F12 and start typing commands into the console. Or just have them navigate to codepen or jsfiddle.

If you are going to do Python, I'd look into Jupyter notebooks because you can get straight to coding without worrying about files and the command prompt. I mean, I love files and the command prompt, but it'd be overwhelming to start there.

I doubt that I would be able to give a good full presentation of the proof without putting a decent amount of time into it myself. However, there is already a proof that there exists an infinite family of SAT instances whose resolution refutations are of exponential size relative to the formula size [here, starting on page 10 (Theorem 4.1)](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~beame/papers/resj.pdf). There is another proof of the same result in Theorem 15.1 of Section 15.2.1 in *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* (2009; Arora, Barak).

Taking this as given, I can try to sketch the rest of the reasoning.

The particular family of SAT instances used in those proofs are statements about the pigeonhole principle: each SAT instance in the family corresponds to the statement that, with n pigeonholes and m pigeons, (i) each pigeon is in a pigeonhole and (ii) there is at most one pigeon in each pigeonhole (for some specific n and m for each instance in the family). They've named each SAT instance in this family ¬PHP^(m)\_n, with natural numbers m, n. However, this family is also restricted to only m and n values where m > n (that is, there are strictly more pigeons than pigeonholes). As a result, the SAT instances in this family are all unsatisfiable by the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) (hence why each one has a resolution *refutation*). These SAT instances each have m + (m choose 2)n clauses, which is <= m^(3). The above proofs show that the resolution refutations for ¬PHP^(n)\_(n-1) have a size of at least 2^(n/20) when n >= 2, which is exponential in n. This means that the size of the resolution refutations grow exponentially relative to the number of the clauses of ¬PHP^(n)\_(n-1), as each SAT instance of that form has <= n^(3) clauses which is polynomial in n.

Note also that an algorithm's time complexity is always lower bounded by its space complexity. As a result, any computation of the resolution refutations of ¬PHP^(n)\_(n-1) will require (at least) exponential time relative to the number of clauses.",8,0,0,0,8,False,False,False,1628365118.0

You can actually reuse clauses in resolution which i’s forgot (for example, solve (-p, q)& (p, s)&(p, -s)&(-p, -q))

However, resolution does work in 2 sat because every solvent has size at most 2, therefore there are at most n^2 of them (with n the number of literals)

In 3sat see that this argument fails instantly. For example the solvent of (-p, q, r) and (p, s, t) is (q, r, s, t)

I did the subject of Logic for CS a few years ago so i don't remember very well and i may have some mistakes, but maybe in order to apply the Resolution algorithm you need that the wff (well formed formula) respects some kind of normal form, in spanish (my native language) this is called ""forma normal conjuntiva reducida"". So perhaps the time needed to bring any wff to this form takes a non-polynomial time, so in that case the Resolution algorithm wouldn't be able to decide in polynomial time if any wff is satisfacible or not.

>I still don’t get why c and c++ are considered different in that way

The level of abstraction is determined by the (reasonably) maximal abstraction offered by the language.

C and C++ operate also under two different paradigms - C is procedural, while C++ objective.

>“C++ is made to be a superset of C” - the creator of c++ 

C++ began its life as superset of C (at the beginning it was called _C with Classes_), but now it's completely separate language (though highly compatible with C). The misconception of C++ being superset of C often bites inexperienced programmers in the hand.

And why is C still used when we have other languages? Maybe not the best analogy, but why are bikes still used when we have motorbikes?",1,0,0,0,1,False,False,False,1628150991.0

The fingerprint or Face ID many people have on their phones is “something you are”.  It’s likely many of them have seen 2-factor authentication codes, and that’s “something you have” (theoretically, you can’t get the code unless you have your phone).

If you want to go another step, you can discuss the difference between AND two factors (“true” two-factor) which is more secure, and that is why they should use it on all important accounts (and consider it in all accounts, period).  In contrast to OR two factors, which is less secure, so it’s important to be sure two-factor is being done right.  Although this could be a user convenience - like your phone unlocking with your fingerprint OR your passcode - the fingerprint is convenience, not increased security.

If you want to go a hair more technical, you can talk about approaches to cracking passwords (assuming the authentication system itself is well designed).  What “brute force” is, and why long, random passwords are harder to brute force.  And then you can talk about dictionary attacks, common password lists, and other shortcuts crackers use to get non-random passwords more easily.  And the dangers of using the same password for more than one thing (the Kinked-In password breach is a good story to tell as an example).

If they have some math ability, you could have them figure out how many random passwords are possible (would need to be brute forced), depending on the length and character set.  You could even give them a rate of passwords guessed per minute and have them figure out how long brute forcing would take.  If they don’t have any background in probability, you’ll have to explain the calculation to them (don’t sidetrack into a probability lesson, just stay focused on the number of password combinations).  If they’re not going to understand _why_ the calculation produces the number of possible passwords, then I’d just skip this.  Learning to crunch some numbers without understanding why they work isn’t useful - the “why” is the important part.  So this really depends on their math level….

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera.""
