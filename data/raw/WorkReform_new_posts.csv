spoflh,I need help,2,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/spoflh/i_need_help/,2,"So I started a new job a few weeks ago. The pay period is every Thursday, so weekly. I haven't seen a single paycheck at all. I asked about it and was told by the person I talked to that they will leave a note for the person who does the paycheck stuff. 
I was also told that I should be getting them and that it was strange that I wasn't.

I'm trying to give them a benefit of doubt. Mainly because I might not be in their system yet or something like that.

I'm so fucking stressed right now and feel like I worked for absolutely nothing. I don't know what else to do.",1644548243.0
spo7ql,can an employer legally deny your requests off until you’ve worked there long enough?,3,0.8,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/spo7ql/can_an_employer_legally_deny_your_requests_off/,3,"so i know this is a weird question, feel free to delete if not allowed. i live in arizona, and i’ve been working at a small clothing store in the mall. when i first started working there, i had tried to request a certain date off because of an appointment and my manager straight up told me “day off requests are only for people who’ve worked here for over a year” and won’t give me the day off so i’d have to call out and use sick time. is it legal for them to do this in the state of arizona? i’ve scoured the employee handbook i was given, and it says nothing about having to have worked there longer then a year to request days off on it? it’s frustrating enough that i’m considering arguing back about it but not sure if my stance is correct, any answers or advice would be much appreciated",1644547653.0

spnz59,"As a paid leave specialist at my state's employment security department, the amount of employers I see trying to work their employees to death is infuriating.",12,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/spnz59/as_a_paid_leave_specialist_at_my_states/,0,"My state is one of the few that has paid family and medical leave benefits for workers (up to 12 weeks). The cost for the program is split between employers and employees (27/73).

Employers can appeal our decision to approve/deny benefits for their employee. I see employers fight **for** approvals, but I also see them fight for denials. The ones that fight for denials think that because we allow them to appeal our decision that the balance of power is in their favor. *Newsflash shitheads: It's not.*

*""We're short-staffed as it is so we are unable to approve their request for leave at this time.""* Who the fuck do you think you are?!

*""We sent the employee ADA reasonable accommodation paperwork that they never completed. We want them to work instead.""* —.—

*""We actually paid them PTO for this time without telling them because we knew that would disqualify them from getting benefits.""* Scumbags.

Not all employers are bad. Far from it. But there is the pervasive idea amongst employers that you are their property and they will treat you as such.

Paid family and medical leave is *for workers* fought for *by workers*. The US is one of the few developed countries without it, but we're fighting for it nationally (it passed the House a few months ago and has moved on to the Senate [where it'll die because America hates progress]). The fight should continue in the state legislatures as well as only something like 9 states have state funded paid leave programs.",1644546968.0

I thought most of what I and my coworkers did throughout my corporate career was worthless bullshit and I wasn't always quiet about this and I ended up unemployed and with no real work connections.  Compound this with a growing sense that there just isn't much quality work to be found out there and I'm pretty well unhireable in my old profession(s).

Anyway, a few months back I started working an entry-level construction job (pay is about 1/3 of what I used to make, but enough for current expenses) and honestly I find I like it a lot more.  I'm too old for this to be sure and have some concern that my body may fail me, but day to day now is just so much better than going to an office and just doing mindless bullshit to keep my boss's boss happy (I think the technofeudalism theorists are onto something).  

Obviously a lot of what is wrong with work exists in any discipline, but for my part the physical toll, the lower salary, the bullshit you have to take from higher-ups at times in construction, is just nowhere near as damaging as doing office work I know to have either no net effect on anything or none but making the biggest douchebag in the company richer.",1644545878.0

This is perfectly legal and fine.  In fact it is actually encouraged and promoted as a Good Experience For Kids^(TM).

The day started at 4:30am, when the fields were covered in dew and the temperatures were in low 50s. By mid-day, we'd be at the other extreme: 80-degree swelter with no shade. This meant I had to prepare for both the heat of the day and the wet mornings by wearing shorts during the coldest part of the day. Changing clothes wasn't an option.

I was injured a lot.  Mostly small stuff; not too many people know this, but corn leaves are sharp, and stiff.  There's so many ways to get a million little cuts and stabs throughout the workday. Especially when some 17-y-o with too much responsibility and work stress for his age is yelling at me to run back to the bus so we can keep schedule. 

But I also got a repetitive stress injury in my hand from the work my second season.  I filed worker's compensation, of course. This brought me a lot of scorn and shame from the older teen shift-leaders, who took every opportunity to mock me because the work was ""too hard for \[my\] dainty hands"" and because I thought I ""deserved money for slacking off.""

I made $5.25 /hr. (adjusted for inflation).

The reason it is legal, is because some small farmers need to rely on their children to work the farm during the summer. Somehow, this means farming mega-corps get to contract tweens for minimum wage and work them to exhaustion and injury.

But it was Good For Me. Right? I got to... um.  Afford snacks.  Buy a few video games, I think?  Never had much time to play them.  After a day in the fields I had to walk a few miles home. I usually took a nap until it was time to make dinner for the family--something I did many nights, since Mom usually didn't get home until 6.

I guess my point is none of this should be a thing. The child labor for massive corporations. The overworked adults. The unpaid labor of caring for a family.  None of it.

If anyone wonders why I am an anti-capitalist, the seeds were planted here.",1644532790.0

&#x200B;

So I decided after the latest debacle of trying to get out of the horrible job I have that it's just not worth it.

The reason I say this is that it's ridiculous at this point. I have to apply online where I upload my  resume, now I have to basically transcribe it into your fields or correct an auto import that went crazy. Then I wait at least 24 hours to receive an email for a personality profile, skills assessment or my recent favorite multiple short video clips of me describing various ways that I would handle situations. I finally said no and withdrew my application.

I will stay in my shitty job rather than risk it calling out sick to make it to an interview to waste an hour plus on bullshit chit chat to be turned down because you found someone willing to take less money.

I’m not going to name the place I work (y’all could figure it out pretty easily however.) I am a college student and I work at this place Bc they, legitimately pay the best in town. So yesterday I was helping unload truck for this company, the boss was also helping unload truck. His job was pushing stuff down the line towards me. The line is like this large line of rollers so the merchandise slides on it to get to the people who stack it up on pallets. There’s usually about 7 or 8 different people helping because it’s a big hecking truck. 

One of the guys left the “line” to use the restroom (he probably has IBS but literally it’s not my business.) My boss didn’t particularly like that so when he got back he straight up screamed at him. I’m talking like angry high school football coach flat out screaming. After he got done with his yelling tantrum, instead of pushing the boxes like a normal human being; he basically was throwing them. I had to pick up like 15 boxes because he pretty much threw them on the floor. Many broke in the process. 

Later, we had a meeting because of prior incidents and the boss is fairly new to the store. In that meeting he essentially told us that he’d be restricting bathroom breaks while unloading truck and stocking the shelves. )He also talked about snow days but that’s an entire different long story.) He pretty much called out the kid with the bathroom issues in front of everyone in that meeting (which was our entire crew) just like he screamed at him earlier.

spcjq5,Boss is moving / selling the company. Any Advice For Me?,15,0.95,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/spcjq5/boss_is_moving_selling_the_company_any_advice_for/,13," 

Soo  I work in a small company in a conservative area of Washington State.  We used to have about 10 employees here and despite my boss's terrible  marketing strategies we've been moving and growing after about 5 years  of me working there. I definitely recognize that I have been a major  part of the company's success and ability to hire on more employees.

Boss  bought a new house in Bumfuck, Idaho and says that he likes the area  but we all know that he is really moving because he's terrified the  government is going to hold him down and vaccinate him. I digress.  ANYway...he is selling the company assets to a competitor in the industry and  retiring. Good riddance.

I have  been ready to ask for another raise since I got bumped up (+$3.00) from  minimum wage a year ago. I'm aware that inflation keeps rising and I  need a raise to keep up with it. I'm also aware that the company has  lost employees over the years so now we're down to just 2 full-time  employees that work under him. That means that I now do the work of 2-3  people on a daily basis.

I have  been hounding him to settle the deal with the new owner so that I could  then have a follow-up meeting and give an ultimatum: You give me a major  raise or risk this company collapsing without me to keep it afloat. The  company name is going to change with a new owner. I am under no  obligation to work for this new company, and they think I am on board  even though I have not actually consented or signed any papers.

Since the company I really work for is moving to  another state and the new guy wants to hire me on, can I just say no to  his offer and collect unemployment?

We have a meeting in 5 days. Does Reddit have any guidance or advice for me before I go into this?",1644515748.0

In my life I've had 34 shitty jobs (many for only a month or 2 because they were that bad and I found work elsewhere). They didn't pay enough and expected the moon from their employees. There's a huge spectrum of industries I've worked - retail, sales, kitchen staff, marketing, social media/SEO, accounting, construction, journalism/broadcasting, dotcom start-up, outdoor/adventure industry, and more.

BTW, just to provide a pre-rebuttal to the trolls that might say I'm a bad worker or whatever, I've only been unemployed for 6 months in my lifetime, I've quit all but one of my jobs (laid off once), and I've only been disciplined twice in my life (mostly because that CEO had unrealistic expectations and was a huge douche).

Now I'm in a union. I work under a contract. There are things in the contract that provide a better work environment and guarantee a quality of life. These are just a few of the things that all workers should be striving for. These are just a few of the things that I wish somebody would have told me were possible when I was younger.

Here is a non-conclusive list of all the things about my job that I used to consider a luxury, but are considered standard practice within my union.

* My pay raises are negotiated by a union rep. This year, effective Jan 1, I got $3.50/hr on the check and another $1/hr into my pension, healthcare, and flex plans. Next year I'll get another $4.50 to distribute across my whole wage package. The year after that, we go back to the negotiating table. I'm still an apprentice, so I only make 60% of this, but our base rate is $52/hr, plus about $35/hr in other benefits.

* If I change employers, as long as I stay within the union, all of this comes with me. I don't have to negotiate a new wage, benefits, or any of that other rubbish.

* The break area has to be warm and comfortable, with a number of microwaves proportionally appropriate to the number of workers. Employees are given ""walking time"" to and from the break area so they can legitimately spend their entire break time resting. 

* Overtime is always optional

* We get walking time in the afternoon so that we walk into work on our time and out of work on the employer's.

* Workers must be provided 72 hours notice of any schedule changes.

* If we're being disciplined, we have the right to request a friend or other union representative to be a witness on our behalf.

* Our time off policy is ""whatever you can afford"" (although in some cases whatever you can afford means getting laid off if it's excessive). Taking a day or 2 off for no reason, or just an afternoon for an appointment doesn't require pulling teeth.

* There is a complex set of rules governing travel time that I won't go into, but essentially it prevents employers from making travel time off the clock unless it's the first place you report to, ie. If you have to report to the shop in the morning, then travel to and from the jobsite is on the clock. Also, transportation must be provided for any travel outside of your first destination, ie. If you're required to report to the shop first, then a company vehicle drives you to the jobsite. 

* I feel stupid for having to type this, but after reading a bunch of your posts I feel like it needs to be stated: there is a rule that the employer has to have clean drinking water readily accessible and available.

* We have a prescribed list of tools and appropriate work attire that we must provide. Anything beyond that scope must be provided by the employer.

* Anything outside of our prescribed 40-hour work week is automatically overtime, regardless of whether or not you've already worked 40. If work was slow on Tuesday and you got sent home 2 hours early, on Saturday all 8 hours are still overtime.

* If work is canceled for any reason, if you showed up to work you get show up pay. For instance, if there's a blizzard and they didn't make a reasonable effort to contact you in a reasonable amount of time and tell you work is canceled, the minute you step on to property you're entitled to show up pay.

Anyway, in conclusion, maybe this sub should contain more information about how to improve the general working condition, and not just be a bunch of screenshots of craigslist and indeed listings. We could do AMAs with union reps whose job it is to improve working conditions, professors studying labor, etc. We could provide resources for avoiding websites that allow inaccurate listings, scams, etc.",1644515096.0

A friend of mine in the North (US) is working at a notable pizza-chain, likely the best-performing one in the state (and proven), but them / their manager have been trying to push around the idea of unionization or collective -forced- bargaining for a while -- with little to no pushback from staff, or seemingly public support. 

This friend and manager have constantly had time off pulled away from them, not seeing a day off in likely several weeks -- And the effect is definitely noticeable. They're being paid like shit, treated like shit, and worked to the bone -- With little in  the way of recompense, or a means to hire new staff to help others rest.

&#x200B;

My co-worker called in sick on Friday and Monday was a holiday, a few weeks later his check is short and he calls HR to find out why.  He accepted the situation and I overheard his part of the conversation.  A quick google later I told him that the conversation with me would have gone quite differently.

Fast forward a few months and I am sick near Thanksgiving in a similar situation.   I pre-emptily contact that same HR person and inform them that I am a Salary employee and my check will not be short paid.  She was beside herself that some peon in the company would talk to her like this in HER KINGDOM!!  She informed me that my check would be short paid and used the ""ITS IN THE HANDBOOK"" excuse.  I requested a meeting with her boss before the check is cut.  She refused.  I created an email to my boss, her boss, and her with a short and polite description of the problem, the call, and a link to the federal law stating Salary employees must be paid for the FULL WEEK for any week that they work any time during that week.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later my phone rings.  It is the owners wife  (Head of HR).  She states company policy.  I tell her company policy is against federal law.  I explain that Salary means I do not get overtime (putting in 50+ hour weeks) but she must pay me my salary no matter how much work I miss if any work is done in that calendar week.  She disagrees and states she is going to contact her lawyer (Owners Daddy is a lawyer).

During the first online interview I did well and the guy seemed to really like me and seemed to want to bring me on to the team. The first red flag was at the end of the interview he did tell me even if the sysadmin role didn't work out he would still want me to apply for a role on their help desk (that is what I am trying to get away from). I just smile and say yes to make sure I don't fuck up my chances.

The next week he reaches back out to me and we schedule my second interview in person this time. So I take off a couple hours in the middle of the day and go there. In this interview I thought I did well and everything was going great until about the last 5 mins or so. That is when he drops the position has been filled and he wants me to be a help desk engineer. He said the pay would be the same I was asking for, so now I know I wasn't asking for not enough. 

Tbh I know I am not the most experienced candidate for that role but I just want to try and move up. Now I am unsure if I should take this position since they didn't tell me before going into the second interview the position I wanted was filled. The pay raise is nice and I will have the option to work from home occasionally. Plus they say there is definitely room for advancement but I am not holding my breath on that promise. At my current job I just feel stuck doing mindless support with no room to grow or be recognized and they only time it looks like I could move up is if someone quits, retires, or is fired.

spatat,American work culture visits Scandinavia - My Scandinavian experience,20,1.0,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/spatat/american_work_culture_visits_scandinavia_my/,7,"Hello Workreform.

I've recently had my first time collaborating with US style corporate life and want to share the experience to whomever might want to read it.

Let me start by setting the scene:

I'm 30, hold a bachelor of engineering, a masters of science and work for a global enterprise. I work around 45 hrs/week average and get paid around 94k USD/year (with 6 weeks vacation, unlimited sickdays without cause and extra pay for ""unreasonable overtime"" to the tune of 80 usd/hour). The last year I have been working on an IT-project that is overseen by an American project manager who has a implementation team of different nationalities, but mostly American.

Whilst the implementation team is very competent, they are extremely shortstaffed. We are talking 4 people responsible for securing implementation of a system that is the backbone of the sites operation and is responsible for over 100 million usd/year.

Due to the difference in timezones, the implementation team would often have to make themselves available when we started our work day. 6 hours before they did. So when I found a bug at 0745, a developer would be available at 0145. Said developer would give me updates at 1600 local time. 2200 for them! Updates I would not read until the next day as I was out of office.

Then they were flown in. They would start work at 0800 in the office but stay online and give updates up until 2000. Some of them were flying in on a sunday and back home on Friday after EOB.

I drove one of the guys on the implementation team to get covid-tested and asked him about his working conditions.

To my surprise he was happy to tell me that  he is paid 85k/year and doing 90 hrs/week, almost always working weekends with 2 weeks of vacation and 6 sick days/year. No overtime pay at all. He asked what I got. I told him everything but my salary as I didn't feel like it was productive at the time.

Individual ownership of a business only makes sense when that individual is the sole employee.  If multiple people are putting in work to make the business succeed they deserve an equal share of the profits they create and an equal say in how their company operates.  The government already regulates the structure and behavior of internal corporate governance so this is no different.

2.) Abolish stocks.  Investments can happen without giving pieces of the company away to outsiders: They're called interest-bearing loans.  If you want to own part of the company and have a say in how it operates, you need to roll up your sleeves, work for it, and contribute something meaningful.

Unwanted passes, unwanted touching, inappropriate comments, etc. Two of these women have left, one changed teams, and the other is still on the team.

 My job has become a nightmare in a lot of ways. Like not having working bathrooms. Something my bosses have started doing to power flex and idk, being awful, is to play a megaphone from a microphone on our intercom system before announcements so they know we're listening. We can't wear headphones inside.

 Sometimes the system freaks out and loops the sound for minutes at a time. 

 I pulled my boss aside last week and had to be uncomfortably honest and tell him that the sounds were starting to trigger my PTSD, especially since the kids in the building now will begin screaming whenever they hear it. Idk why they're shrieking but some of them start screaming when they hear it and the only way to be heard over it is to yell over it so sometimes staff members are forced to scream just to be heard over it.  My boss feigned concern and even thanked me for pulling him aside to share my truth or whatever... 
 And he's back at it again Monday. It got so bad on Wednesday that I couldn't drive myself home and when I got home I grabbed a pillow and started shrieking into it and pulled out some of my hair.

I accepted a paramedic position in a hospital ED for $17/hr base pay in FL. There's an extra $2/hr for nights plus $1/hr for weekends. The job was listed as a mid shift when I applied (3p-11p), but when they made the offer they said they needed me on night shift instead and I'm really not stoked about that... But I'm willing to give it a shot since they promised they'd switch me to days when an opportunity becomes available. I had a couple of pre-existing plans made before they contacted me about the job that they were willing to honor and push back my start date for. Then I got injured and they were generous enough to push it back even further. This is a really nice hospital and it is close to home. I think I would like working there. They have been very accommodating, likely because they are drowning in patients and need help like most hospitals in my area.

So here's where I could use some input. I think I was low-balled and I failed to negotiate a better salary early on. However, I have not started the job yet. I don't want to start off with a bad reputation since they already accommodated my plans and my injury but I think my pay is a little low for the position, especially since I probably never would have applied if I knew they would want me on nights. For reference I was offered a Paramedic position with a couple of security companies for $25/hr but for various reasons I turned those down. It's about more than the money. I need to work in a hospital setting but while I'm at it I would like to be compensated as best I can. I've seen on Glassdoor a paramedic position in another hospital much further away from me averaging $23/hr. Not sure how accurate that is, but if I could get $23/hr there and $25/hr as a security officer/paramedic, I feel like $17/hr base pay at my current offer is way too low. Since I haven't started yet I was thinking of contacting HR and asking if they could raise the base pay. Otherwise I do think I'd be willing to walk. Lots of hospitals need paramedics and RNs right now. Any advice?",1644475320.0

I'm in training this week for field service work along with five other people from all over the country, and we're all getting to know each other and sharing experiences. This one guy, J, has the most career experience of all of us, and he starts talking about his last job, and it's just terrible. You were GPS tracked, and got in trouble if you didn't show up to a customer site by 9 AM each day, even if they told you they weren't going to open until 11. After he was hired they told him that he had to be on call 24/7 for one week out of every four, so he slept on the couch to avoid waking his wife. And he still had to show up at 9 even if he was up all night fixing machines until 5 AM. A colleague was denied a raise because a customer accidentally gave them a bad rating while trying to give them top marks and the company wouldn't correct the error after they were made aware. Just the worst, most unfair treatment that ruined morale and had no benefit to the company at all. And eventually J went somewhere else.

And as we go around talking through the day, it's just clear that this place we all just started isn't like that. Instead of begging for time off, you just schedule it. You don't need to beg to get it approved, it just has to be on the calendar. J was surprised that the company didn't try to get people to lie about their overtime. And if you need tools for work you put it on a company card.

None of this is utopian. It's just not mistreatment.

At the end of the day, one of the other folks asked J how he was getting back to his hotel, and he said he was taking taxis, and the first guy told him that he had the same manager, and he was renting a car. You could do it through an online portal, and it was covered if you're traveling for work.

Why shouldn't it be? Over a two week trip, taxis aren't even cheaper, and the paperwork is a huge time sink.

Again, this isn't a story of some dream employer. It's just what it looks like when a guy who is accustomed to being completely abused at work goes somewhere where professionals treat other professionals like professionals. This should be *the minimum*. This should be the *starting point* for negotiations. There is no excuse for lying and cheating and bullying the people that make companies and the whole economy run just because they earn their pay by the hour instead of through investment earnings. And it's so gratifying to see this guy J start to recover from the absolute shit he's been through because he didn't put up with it any longer.",1644468262.0

So, what regulations would you make to stop them from potentially turning everyone into renters? To prevent everyone from pissing away their wealth because there is no equity to be gained from rental payments.

I say, single family houses should be completely illegal to rent out. Multifamilies are ok, as are apartment buildings, perhaps even condos. But the traditional house is reserved for citizens to buy and sell. Flipping should be legal, as it improves the property in many cases. Buying up tons of foreclosures as soon as they hit the market should be illegal if they do no improvements and simply wait for them appreciate in a bull market.

I was really close to him so it hit pretty hard. We knew he was dying so I was able to fly to him and say goodbye. 

My boss originally was very sympathetic, and told me to “take all the time I needed and don’t worry about when I’m coming back”. So that’s what I did (btw this was an hourly job, I was not getting paid for the time I took off, and I wasn’t screwing anyone over by not being there for a while as they were well staffed). 

I flew across the country and then took care of him with my family as he died. Then once he passed we had to fly to another state for the funeral so he could be buried with my grandma. This all took about 1 and 1/2 weeks, and when I finally got back home, I wanted to take another day off to finally just grieve and rest from traveling. 

I hadn’t heard a single thing from my boss this whole time. I figured everything was cool because she told me to literally not worry about coming back. And then my coworker texts me out of the blue saying, “boss is really pissed that you haven’t been back to work yet and is wondering where you are”. 

So, not only did my boss not communicate with me at all over the phone, text or email (which she had all of), but then she talked about the situation to another coworker of mine instead of just reaching out to me directly. I felt so disrespected, she had directly told me taking the time off was ok then complained about me behind my back. 

I immediately started looking for new jobs. Found one in a few weeks and quit that place without a two weeks notice. Their communication has always sucked but this was the final straw for me.

Are employers really that pressed for control over their employees that they can’t understand how death affects people? Even when I wasn’t essential I was pressure to come back to work, for apparently no reason.

""The system isn't broken, the people getting an unusable degree are. I'm not saying that everyone that goes to college gets an unusable degree, but there are plenty that do. Another aspect to consider is enrolling in a that costs 30k+ a year. On top of that, if I take out a loan for a home /vehicle /whatever, I sign the documents stating I agree to pay the money back. I don't get a forbearance because I can't afford to pay it back. If you don't want that payment, don't borrow the money!

Does this lead into a boat of other discussions, yes. Do any of those discussions change the fact someone signed a legal document promising to repay a loan, absolutely not. Have costs gone up on everything? Yep, they have. Increased costs (think $15 minimum wage) get passed on to the consumer. Businesses are in business to make money, not make people ""feel"" good. Capitalism isn't a swear word, it's the greatest driver of invention and services ever concieved... There's so much to unpack in this discussion that a FB comment doesn't do it justice!""

Our last manager, for some reason, decided to get rid of the security guards. Sure, it was only one person a week (on Sundays), but at least it was something. And I'm sure they could always contact the company if they need security on another day of the week (preferably every day, but that's just my opinion). 

Recently, we've had a group of maybe 10-15 late teens/early 20s misbehaving. They keep taking the basketballs from one of the games, and lobbing them around (and at each other). A few days ago, they were playing dodgeball with them in the main reception area. They did something similar today, but much less extreme. It still sent me into a panic attack. 

Our current manager says he's working on getting a security guard. I'll be completely honest: I don't feel safe. Although I drive home, I still work until 1-2am most shifts. Although I'm almost never the only staff member out on the floor, I still do feel unsafe. We don't have many staff, and anything could go wrong. That group could corner me, or one of them could follow me round to the back. They could easily throw my walkie talkie away, and just as easily overpower me. 

I haven't set myself a time limit yet, but I can't take this for much longer. I feel bad for my coworkers, but I don't want to put myself in harm's way unnecessarily. If we don't get official security soon, I'm leaving. Does this seem like a fair resolution?",1644456866.0

I believe that pay above and beyond that requirement should represent the output and quality of your work because hourly rates incentivise lower output because they result in the same pay. And being able to double quality output should be rewarded, not abused.

No one had worked there for longer than 3-4 months, aside from the managers. I kept my head high and recieved nothing but glowing reviews about my work ethic, salesability, and attitude. It seemed like everyone overall enjoyed having me there because of my experience with the medical aspect of it all because I have some disabilities. 
 
I had missed a few days early into my time there (got sick and needed a covid test). During my two months, everything else went great until I had to call out last Friday, major migraine and couldn't drive to work in the dark. I have all my medical paperwork which describes that my migraines (and other disabilities), my manager gave me the okay to take Friday off and bring the paperwork in on Monday. I spent the entire day Monday being ignored by both managers working, even training a newish person, until I was called in at the end of my workday to be told I was fired for attendance. I received no prior warnings at all and was told by my managers that it was okay when I missed those days. They knew about my disabilities prior to me starting and when they finally told me to bring it in, they fired me before it was in the system. The biggest kicker is, we were having this meeting in my bosses office with the lights off because... He had a migraine. 

Now I didn't mean for this post to be so long, but while I was upset that I was let go, I was also extremely angry. I went on indeed the second I got home, applied at a dispensary that's 45 minutes closer to me, landed an interview the next day (Tuesday), and was told today (Wednesday) that I got the job. This job comes with better pay, a better commute, and some benefits where there were none at all at my last job. 

I'm lucky though. I have a supportive SO who fortunately makes enough money to cover while I find another job, not everyone has that, in fact, most people don't. I'm also very fortunate that I was able to find a replacement job so quickly, I know how hard the struggle is to find a job. Prior to landing my previous job, I had been searching for over a year for a job that would hire me despite my disabilities.

Work reform is about workers rights to be treated like a human being. I cannot control my disabilities and when they flare up, just like a coworker cannot control a death in the family (they were fired about a week before I was). 

I didn't mean for this post to be so long, but the overall message is: know your worth and recognize the red flags of a workplace, and don't forget to fight for your own rights.

sop25x,My Union Is Terrible,20,0.72,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sop25x/my_union_is_terrible/,34,"I know most folks here are big supports of unions, and I do support the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain, but I think often the economic progressive types are too willing to overlook flaws with unions in favor of blind cheerleading.

Supporting workers means supporting them against bad unions as well.

I work as an adjunct professor, which if you don't already know, means I earn shit, work part time, and have zero benefits. (Most adjuncts work multiple jobs; I do tutoring to pay the bills.) The adjuncts here unionized just before I joined, about 8 years ago. While the union did get a raise for employees in the first contract, every single subsequent contract has seen us lose money in real-dollar terms (meaning if we get a raise, it's below inflation). If pay merely matched inflation, I'd be earning 8% more.

In the most recent negotiations (which are still on-going), management offered a 0.6% increase. We re-negotiate every *other* year, so that's just 0.3% annually. It'll actually end up being lower because negotiations have stalled, and management won't make any agreement retroactively applicable.

Our initial contract contained a massive poison pill for faculty. The contract has a No Strike clause, which I can understand given the nature of the work (if we strike for 2 weeks, there's no making that up for students). But, we *also* have an Automatic Renewal clause, which means if negotiations over a new contract reach an impasse, the previous terms automatically renew themselves. Management can offer us 0.6% and our options are (a) accept, or (b) get 0.0%.

And here's a fun little side perk: Joining the union (meaning actually joining the union, not just falling under their representation umbrella) means agreeing to never advocate for removing the union. And of course, you have to be a union member to vote on leadership issues, so the shitty terms of the contract auto-renew, the only way to get out of it would be to replace the union with another union, and the only people allowed to vote on that are prohibited from doing so.

Did I mention last year our dues went up by 1/3rd? If not: Last year, our dues went up by 1/3.

But wait, there's more...

We have about 600-700 adjuncts with open contracts (a small number actually teach each semester). *We do not have a shop steward*. Any time this is raised with the union, the conversation is quickly tossed in the memory hole.

We have a Union-Management Collaboration Committee, but our seat on the committee has been vacant for well over a year. The union's explanation is they haven't figured out a process for filling it. But, no biggie, because the previous representative apparently did nothing. The committee kept no minutes, made no reports, and made frequent use of the memory hole. When I asked that the committee publish minutes, I was told it'd be brought up at the next union meeting, but it was predictably memory holed as well. [One recent example. We can file for 'good faith consideration' to get appointed to the same course next year. The form for Spring courses is due in March, only a couple days after it's sent out, and if you recall March 2020, it was complete chaos. I contacted our committee chair, noted the due date amid the chaos of moving classes online, and asked if the union could request an extension -- she had no idea when the deadline was because she never files, when I followed up I got no response, and when I went directly to the admin office that handles the paperwork, they said no big deal but that they hadn't heard from the union or management about it. *Memory holed.* And we did have people lose jobs because they never filed.]

But wait, there's more...

In grievances, you can choose to represent yourself or have the union represent you. If you're a union member though, there's no choice -- you must use their representative. *Their* representative. The union bylaws state they'll resolve grievances as best benefits *the union,* not the employee filing the grievance. The system is so messed up that union representatives will keep the details of grievance resolutions confidential *from* the person who filed the grievance. You get the minimum information, and requests for full details are shot down.

And if you're wondering why we can't just vote in better leadership if it's so bad, we're only one of about 7 universities the union represents. And, the union represents more than just university adjuncts -- their biggest group are the county's public school teachers, who outnumber all the adjunct faculty combined.

So like I said, I support the right to organize, but right now the biggest barrier where I work is the union itself (I shit you not, they actively try to exclude non-members from participation, and then say ""well, no one's participating, so we can't do anything"").

A bad union can be worse than no union, and if you want to improve lives for workers, *better* unions needs to be part of the discussion not just *more* unions. That's like the debate over ""less regulation"" without first identifying what regulations we're talking about -- some are good, some are bad.",1644443686.0

This is really upsetting to me. Fast food restaurants around us are starting at 18.00/hr or more. I saw a McDonald's sign that was looking for shift managers for 21.50/hr. 

She also gets no benefits and no job security as a substitute teacher.

It is bad enough that this young man was almost killed the same way Ahmaud Arbery was for just doing his job.  His work then punishes him for being uncomfortable and anxious about returning to a route where he was almost murdered.

FedEx should be ashamed.

Highlights from the article:

 Gibson recalls the events of that night, saying to the Free Press, “In my mind, I’m thinking \[the driver\] is leaving to go to the store or something like that, but then they get extremely close to me and start blowing their horn. I proceed to leave the driveway. As I’m leaving the driveway, he starts driving in the grass trying to cut me off.” 

 “I drive down about two or three houses. There’s another guy standing in the middle of the street pointing a gun at my windows and signaling to me to stop with his hands, as well as mouthing the word, ‘Stop.’ I shake my head no, I hide behind the steering wheel, and I swerve around him as well. As I swerve around him, he starts firing shots into my vehicle.” 

 I just went as fast as I could. He chased me all the way to the interstate,” he recounted, claiming that the truck stopped following him 10 or 15 minutes after getting on the highway. 

 Gibson reported that he and the manager found, “There were bullet holes all in the back of the van, inside packages and everything like that.” 

 The police report reads, “Ms. Candice Welch, said she was Mr. Gibsons boos \[sic\], the van had at least \[sic\] two bullet holes, One in the back door and one in the bumper, and three packages inside had bullet holes in them. She also had a picture of a bullet, that is still laying on van.” 

 Moore said that his client’s experience had a striking resemblance to the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, the Black man who was chased down and killed by three white men in south Georgia in 2020. 

 Gibson started working for FedEx during the pandemic in July 2021. Despite the traumatic incident, FedEx did not change his delivery route. Gibson has not returned to work and is currently on unpaid time-off, stating he was “uncomfortable” and “anxious” about resuming the assignment.

I started as a receptionist at their newest office at the time. They'd just bought it and the contracts for the agents who worked there. So, I was in a position that was ""in flux"" and had more or less free reign to create my own processes for the work. 

I excelled. I was earning the most I'd ever earned at the time ($18/hr) plus a $100 cleaning contract for the office space. I'd created forms to help work flow, streamlined the entire data entry process to the point where I could complete an entire days work in mere hours... Among other improvements.

Management noticed and eventually promoted me to the main office. At this point I was making $20/hr and training the new and existing staff in my processes at management's request. I felt valued. 

But I undervalued myself. I can look back and see that I was giving them so much free consulting work, so much expertise gone to waste not advocating for myself. I was doing the work of an office manager but accepting way below my real value because of the promise of better. Was even promoted again ($23) to conveyancing. 

Then the 2nd/main conveyancer was hired. The office formed cliques. And I was the weird one who didn't want to play office politics. I didn't care to be friends. And they made me feel like shit for it by showing me that -they- cared about the politics and that I would be ostracized for wanting to keep professional. 

The office manager at the time got fired for losing 10k and an owner stepped in to fill the role (temp then permanent) despite my application for the position. I'd stated my qualifications were the work id already done with their processes, training, and my business admin courses and the fact I'd already been responsible for a lot of supplier sourcing and office management anyway.

Eventually the cliques escalated to calling my ability to do my job into question. They began logging my mistakes and complaining to management over every little thing. Now, I'm not saying I'm perfect. I make stupid mistakes like anyone, and while I check my work, sometimes they squeak through. But this was to a level that was causing more issues. I wasn't being supported, I was being beaten down. Which only caused more and more mistakes due to worsening depression. 

It's like a self fulfilling prophecy: treat your employees like they're incompetent and that's what they'll become or they'll quit. ((Please quit. Don't be me.))

Management wouldn't involve themselves in it, stating that the social dynamics werent their concern, and that maybe I should just work harder to not make mistakes. And then the worst thing: the clique suggested a ""work improvement plan"" where I log my mistakes..... At this point the social order was trying to get one of the ft receptionists into a 3rd conveyancing role, and I'd started to suspect they'd also decided to just go for my role as well.

Paranoid? I dunno, my coworkers were bffs and honestly... Even if I was, it certainly felt well founded. And I ended up on this work improvement plan that basically outlined why I'm incompetent without ever even mentioning where I excelled. And in the end I got fired.

Tldr;

Never do consulting work for free. This includes: Proprietary forms, process manuals, training other staff (without the title/position to match)

Never agree to a ""work improvement plan"" where you log all your mistakes and incriminate yourself. 

I will forever be salty about this because I loved the work. I loved the agents and the rest of the staff. I put so much of myself into that job and would have stayed for decades but instead I was treated like replaceable garbage. Don't be me.

How many of these posts do you see? ""My old job was garbage and now I found a better job paying n% more!"" This isn't a win! What this actually means is your old company has been enjoying underpaying you the ENTIRE time. We have been conditionally groomed by society to stick with a single company for ""as long as possible"" when it is frankly detrimental to your earning potential.

How many of you actually get COLA (cost of living adjustment) increase every year? That's just the increase you need to make what you made LAST year. It doesn't even account for increases due to experience, performance, etc. The uncomfortable truth is that companies are money-making entities and not ""family,"" where their financial responsibility is to lowball your salary as much as possible. If you are relying on your employer to treat you ""fairly,"" that is never going to happen. 

The most important change we need is to make employment a 2-way conversation rather than a 1-way conversation. Instead of just ""why should we hire you / why should you keep your job,"" we need more of  ""why should I work for you"" back in the discussion. This all begins with actively looking for opportunities and gaining leverage (i.e. competing offers). Companies treat their employees like disposable units of labor, but employees should also be treating their companies as temporary employment until you find something better.

These jobs don't care about output. They don't care if you go the extra mile, they don't care if you have good idea, good intentions, good numbers, good anything. 

Your biggest and most important asset to them is you showing up. You simply being present is what makes the business run. They can try and push sales numbers and targets and store rankings but it doesn't matter. 

Any of these huge companies will not fail if they have a few ""underperforming"" locations. This is why poor attendance will get you fired, but working hard does not translate in to career growth.Its easier to just replace a broken cog then to reconfigure the machine.

Don't just do little to no work under the radar. If you hate your job, be active in changing it. Get yourself fired over trying to form a union. Keep hammering them until they break. Become more than just a broken cog. Break the machine so they have to rebuild it.",1644415203.0

soc0jb,The Brazilian example: you can have basic rights without living in Sweden,14,0.77,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/soc0jb/the_brazilian_example_you_can_have_basic_rights/,9,"Hello everyone!

^(First of all, I apologize for my poor grammar. English isn't my first language, but I'll try my best. I also acknowledge that Brazil isn't a prime example of a prosperous nation, but it's what I can offer. Lastly, the existence of laws alone does not mean that these  rights are universally respected, but it is a valuable first step)

I've been reading countless disheartening accounts in this sub about how workers are treated in the US, and how little rights they have, so I thought I should tell you about how things work here in Brazil. If even we can have basic rights, I believe it is more than possible to achieve the same level of legal protection in the US

For starters, the following rights are enshrined in our [Constitution](https://www.oas.org/es/sla/ddi/docs/acceso_informacion_base_dc_leyes_pais_b_1_en.pdf):

1. racism is a non-bailable crime, which includes race discrimination in the workplace (art. 5, XLII)
2. salary cannot be reduced, unless if approved by the corresponding workers' union (art. 7, VI)
3. 13 salaries per year (usually, one extra salary in December) (art. 7, VIII)
4. 8-hour work day and a 40-hour work week, with mandatory overtime pay at least 50% higher than the regular hour rate (art. 7, XIII and XVI)
5. at least one day off per week (art. 7, XV)
6. yearly paid vacation, with an extra 1/3 increase in the regular salary (art. 7, XVII)
7. 120 days of maternity leave and the right to paternity leave (art. 7, XVIII)

Furthermore, our [Labor Code](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del5452compilado.htm) (^(sorry, I couldn't find a translation)) expands these rights to include:

1. all efforts to defraud or hinder any principle contained in the Labor Code are illegal, including the principle of the right to unionize. In effect, union-busting efforts are illegal (art. 9 and 511)
2. the employer carries the burden to prove its innocence against all charges levied by the employee (art. 818)
3. for shifts exceeding 6 hours, employees have the right to at least 1-hour lunch break, or 15-minutes break for shifts exceeding 4 hours (art. 71)
4. in between shifts, employees must have at least 11 hours free (art. 66)
5. employers are responsible for the health and safety of their employees (art. 154), and are obliged to provide all necessary personal protection equipment (art. 166)
6. employees must contribute with 1-day salary to their respective union (the union tax). Employers must pay between 0.02% and 0.8% of their annual revenue to the workers' union
7. it is extremely easy to pierce the corporate veil if the company cannot afford to pay what it owes its employees (art. 855-A)
8. labor-related credits have priority over most credits (even taxes) in case of bankruptcy

Lastly, the following conducts are crimes under the Brazilian [Criminal Code](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/del2848compilado.htm):

1. submitting workers to forced labor, exhaustive work shifts or degrading work conditions (art. 149)
2. using violence or grave threats to stop anyone from unionizing (art. 199)
3. defrauding rights ensured by the Labor Code (art. 203)

It barely scratches the surface of labor rights in Brazil, but these are real concepts that are actually possible. Of course, Brazil is no paradise. We, too, suffer with income inequality, rampant inflation, unemployment and a myriad of other problems

However, if half of the stories that I read here in this sub happened in Brazil, the employers would already be drowning in lawsuits. Some would even be incarcerated

Do not accept less than what your third-world friends already have. The outrage you feel is real and a natural reaction to the inconceivable disrespect US workers suffer when the State refuses to ensure even basic rights

Been a lurker on r/anti work for a while, shifted here when it blew up because..of the passion? I’m not sure, but anyways I’m posting because I do not know what else to do. I’ve been losing sleep and drinking a lot because of all the stress my job is causing me. 

I am a maintenance technician for a very big property management company. I do a lot of siding and deck repair, gutter fixing and cleaning, pressure washing, and painting. Since October, work has “slowed down”, which is usual but not to this extent. I’ve been getting around 0-10 hours a week on average. Maybe a few 18 hour weeks sprinkled in there. Thats not even a part time job. 

I’ve gone to my supervisor and the boss about this several times, stating that I need more hours to literally survive. Each time I’ve been given an unhelpful, ludicrous reply that basically amounts to me being gaslit beyond all belief and I walk out of his office with my ass in my hands wondering why tf I got turned around because I get flustered easily when talking to authority figures. My boss has severe adhd, as do I, and he’ll change the topic of why I’m in there to like some bullshit mansplaining of how billing works at our company. It’s infuriating. The second time, I went to my boss stating that I’m not getting any work on my schedule again, and that I don’t believe my supervisor is doing his job (to put things on my schedule) 
and he looked me in my face
[this is the branch manager we’re talking about,he is the top dog in charge] 
and he says “okay, what is YOUR solution?”
I felt my soul leap out my body and strangle him. My anger was full throttle, but I was genuinely dumbfounded. What’s MY solution??  First my supervisor isn’t doing his job, now I have to be branch manager as well, like okay step 1 fire my supervisor. It’s insulting that my supervisor “works” from home 99% of the time and doesn’t do a damn thing and gets a nice comfy salary. I know he’s barely doing anything when he works from home because I’ve seen him watching tv while in the office. I could go on about my jerkoff of a supervisor but it’s not necessary. None of it probably is I’m just so upset. 

I called HR about the lack of hours and the way my boss has neglected to be any sort of helpful, told them everything that’s been off the past few months with the company and the way things are being run, and that did literally nothing for me besides let my boss know that I called HR on him. Great thanks. 
There is the property management side of the company, dealing with HOA’s and community board meetings, and then there is the maintenance department. Based on the way the maintenance side is run, or lack of, it’s obvious he puts little effort into managing my side of the company, because it’s a lot smaller, and it’s a lot more convenient to sub the work out to other contractors, rather than route the work to us. It’s a headache that he doesn’t want to deal with so he’s letting it fail. I wish I could prove it I just don’t know how or where to begin. I want to prove he’s creating a hostile work environment for me. If I had a dollar for every time someone said “oh your boss wants you to quit because he can’t fire you” after I explain the lack of hours, I’d probably have enough to buy some dinner besides ramen. 
I ate butter noodles almost every day last month, and I would’ve missed rent if I hadn’t. But even that is a lie, because I didn’t have butter. Fucking olive oil and Parmesan after I ran out of garlic salt. Quit nicotine last month as well but not for health reasons just I can’t afford that. Barely enough money for a bottle of bourbon to drown out my invasive thoughts. It’s a viscous fucking loop. I haven’t been able to save any money for a vehicle so I’ve been applying to jobs within walking/biking distance (grocery stores and dish washing) and I’m not hearing anything back. As a maintenance man I currently make $16.50 , tomorrow I’m applying to the fried chicken store I used to work at because they’re hiring for $15… the US is fucked. 

I have about 84~ hours of vacation, I think imma take a 2 week paid break and then quit. I can’t take it anymore. The uncertainty of making enough to just survive is mentally 
torturing me. If you got any funny quitting ideas please let me know, I kinda want to dump my cat litter box on his car. 

TL;DR 
 Work no give hours, I ask for more and boss tell me get fucked. I tell HR, HR tell me get fucked. Time to work fast food for basically the same rate.

A little background, I am a virtual assistant working for a virtual assistant agency based in Australia who charges their clients a lot but only give VA's like me a measly salary.
They also had me install a tracker on my personal laptop saying it is to measure productivity, I don't see any weirdness yet but a colleague of mine told me that the tracker took screenshots when she was watching movies during the weekend.


I was notified by HR earlier today that my client asked for a new virtual assistant because I yawned twice during a call meaning I was uninterested on working with my client.
This apparently happened twice because I was reported twice (the first time was supposedly last December where I had a client call but I wasn't smiling during the call)
I work at 7am to 3pm on my timezone (GMT+8), I mean it's doable but there are times where my insomnia strikes or if I don't get enough sleep because I hung out with my friends, family etc. 


Back to my dilemma, I started working for the client this Monday and we had back-to-back Zoom calls, and during those calls I have yawned for a couple of times but I excused myself.
I was also taking down notes during the meeting because the tasks my client wants me to do was a bit too technical for me (I'm an executive assistant/personal assistant by trade) so there had been times where I wasn't looking at the camera, I had my headset on so I was still listening.

My supervisor told me that HR will be sending a Notice to Explain to me within this week and they'll investigate my behaviour then put me in the retraining department but won't let me have future clients anymore.

I always felt good that I had nothing compared to the horror stories I see here. Our managers are great, I often feel appreciated for my work, I'm paid on time, and when I started, I was getting a fair market wage. And yet, here we are.

When I started, I was being brought on as a Systems Engineer onto a team of developers and engineers. However, I was also told that shortly before I started, they (and by they I mean HR) had changed our internal titles in the company to ""technical support specialist"". Everyone on the team had been really angry about that and we were even told by our managers that they didn't care if we put our actual job title in our LinkedIn and stuff because that's what we did. We don't do tech support. It's a title and it's not overly important, but it's annoying.

So last month we had our internal company surveys and basically everyone brings up the fact that the market has changed and we're all dramatically underpaid for our roles, not to mention that inflation means everyone's costs of living have dramatically increased. We got told that they were taking this seriously and that they knew it was something that needed to be addressed. We were essentially assured that we wouldn't just be getting a simple market adjustment.

Well this week the hammer dropped. We all get basically peanuts. What amounts to somewhere between 2-5%. We were told that ""based on the current market rate for technical support specialists, that is the current pay rate.""

Well there's been an uproar to say the least. You can't give us a title that doesn't match our actual job duties, then use that wrong title to justify paying us dramatically below the market rate. Because we're all actually friends and talk, we are all talking about it. We even started a private Slack channel called 2022 Let Down (and no, management can't see it; we're the Slack admins so we're the ones they'd have to ask if they wanted to snoop). One of our developers is saying maybe he'll refuse to do dev work and simply say ""I'm a tech support specialist; maybe you should hire a developer."" Basically everyone on the team is saying that they are considering leaving, especially since we could be getting 20-30% more doing the exact same job. They might find themselves with half or more of the team gone within a month or two. It really sucks because everyone on the team loves the team and the work. If they had offered us an even halfway decent pay bump, it would have been a different story. I'm willing to take a little less to be under management that's great, on a team I like, doing work I enjoy, but when it ends up up like this....

Now I know for a fact that the managers and directors of our team have been arguing for more and warning that they might lose us (and find it impossible to replace us anywhere near that budget), but the C-Suit went and did this. What's more, our managers have been demanding that our titles be fixed as well with HR and have been told that it is ""in the works"". I'm guessing they were waiting until this adjustment so that they could justify it before doing any title change.

Maybe they'll change their minds if they find out their top level engineering and developer team of 20 people is basically all going to leave within months. This was a major letdown to a company that I've mostly enjoyed working at and feel generally treats their employees well.

Anyway, I know this doesn't compare to the multitudes of workers out there making minimum ways with abusive managers, but it's a sign of the problems. We're a public company and they're announcing record profits (we're a financial company) and stock buybacks. They can pay us more. They just choose not to.",1644378520.0

My boss decide last week to cut my hours my 10 without any notice. I tried to contact her and she only answered 3 days later saying to contact someone else and talk with them. Today i get to my job to finally understand the situation and its seems like coworkers has started to bitch about me.... 

So the reason they cut my hour was because 2-3 people start to talk in my back to my boss, like that i was talking too much, didnt want to do some task etc. Now, the Head of Hr told me that we're a family here, things like that happen in a family and that if i dont want to be targeted, i need to start talking about others so i wont be the target anymore.  Also a comment from this guy is shaking me a little, he told me that he has the authority to fire me in two weeks if the situation wasn't any better. They wanted me to sign a document but i told them that they needed to make a verbal warning before anything else. They said a lot of thing during that time, didn't register everything, but i'm thinking about writing down everything, with date and timestamp to keep a log.

Now, they want to see me in 2 weeks to reevaluate, what should i do ? I tought about calling the labor standart (idk if its the good word, im from Canada), cause i just lost a total of 20 hours without any warning, i need that money but not the stress from the situation.",1644378729.0

I've been making staff purchases since Dec 2021 with no issues. 

In the contract of part time and full time employees they have to wait 6 months to make a staff purchase as that will be when they finish their probation. I have read through my contract and employee handbook and found nothing in writings that says I need to wait. I'm also not on probation as I'm on a casual contract.

The area manager is unable to point me towards anywhere it is written down that I have to wait 6 months before making a staff purchase.

I've contacted HR and they told me the same information but they didn't just brush it off when I asked where I would find it in person. So now I'm just waiting for HR to get back to me so I can make a staff purchase or not.

In their general studies class, they ran a ""life"" project. Each kid was paired up and given a theoretical baby and a job with an up-to-date salary. Kids chose whether to rent or buy a house with a mortgage based on Zillow prices in the area. They were then given a sheet of costs: daycare costs, groceries, 2 required cars, and religious expenses. Many of the costs were simplified--groceries for $500 a month for example, and a single mother (odd number of students) was given additional leniencies to make the math work better for her at the cost of reality.

""This is what my fiance and I make together"" she says to a pair who are in the negative, just like two other couples in her five pairs.

For reference, my job is an electrical reliability engineer/analyst. Essentially I look at electronic schematics and create prediction reports and failure analyses on these schematics to make sure the electronics won't cause huge issues for whatever systems it is connected to, or if it does fail, it doesn't do it in a way that will cause a spectacular light show or cause harm to humans or other connected systems.

My current (soon to be former) company hired me on to help work on sub-contracted electronics from vendors for a system that is going to be flown by NASA through another customer that hired us. This system is part mechanical, and part electrical, and when I hired on there was a very experienced mechanical reliability engineer there to handle the mechanical portion of this system that was mainly being built by my company (the electronics I was going to be responsible for came from vendors to connect and help operate said mechanical equipment). We worked well together and got along well and I was actually learning a bit from him about new software and practices I hadn't been familiar with before, until he was offered another position outside the company that he took.

He resigned about a month after I came onboard, and my company opened a rec for another engineer and told me to just continue on where he left off. Luckily, none of the electronics had actually gone through preliminary review, so that gave me some time to try to learn the mechanical side until they got a new person hired. Now, the practices I use for electronics can easily be applied to the mechanical side, but the math and statistics and general knowledge of the parts are not so easy to supplement. So, for a few months, I was essentially trying to learn mechanical engineering until they get a new hire to start doing the work.

Well, Christmas rolled around, and I took vacation, but not before telling my manager (who isn't an engineer btw) that I haven't seen any resumes for people to try to hire anyone. Comes to find out, we had about 25 people apply to the job and they never had me look at any of the resumes, and they know dick all about picking people that are qualified. So I asked to see the resumes, not the ones they think are qualified, ALL OF THEM. 

I come back from vacation and sort through the resumes and find 2 people qualified, and I ask HR and manager to work out some time to interview them (this was about a month ago now). About a week ago I get a thing for the HR site to look over resumes and select qualified people, so I do (which I thought I already did, but whatever) and find out through that site that they closed the req on the job about a month after they posted it. 

So, this all comes to a head today, where they want me to complete and finalize an analysis on a piece of MECHANICAL equipment so it can go through its critical design review and I lost it. NO! I will not author any fucking papers and certify anything for this fucking company that I have no right in even analyzing. ESPECIALLY FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT!! That is how I get barred from working in my industry for good. 

So, tomorrow, I am going into a meeting with all the chief engineers, and program manager and giving them formal notice that I am resigning this Friday. Not when you hire someone new, not after I train new personnel, not in 2 weeks, Friday. And it will feel oh so good to be free of people that have no clue what I do and how important it is.",1644370341.0

Right now the people with extreme amounts of power are using it to block the panic button while they plan their escape, and they'll let us die in the process.

1. The Slack-Picker Upper.  *Prides themselves on their work ethic, wonders why everyone around them is so lazy.  Is used to offset the costs of sick days, maternity leave, and other things that should really come out of company profits.  Thinks doing this will earn them a promotion, but often not promoted due to their utility*.
2. The Lazy Manager.  *Doesn't want to work too hard, sometimes because they're selfish, sometimes because they know they're being ripped off.  Shamelessly delegates tasks to other employees, namely #1.  Gets promoted despite all of this due to a few key interactions in front of higher ups, and the fact that they share the owners' attitude toward the other workers.*
3. The Jealous, Incompetent Manager.  *Has terrible management skills, terrible communication skills, and knows deep down they are lucky to be in a management position, so they will do whatever the owners desire.  Used to prevent upward mobility by being impossible to work with, setting employees up to fail, and blaming it on them.*
4. The Golden Child.  *Seems to be good at everything, but doesn't do that much work.  Clearly accustomed to occupying a position of relative privilege, either due to talent or background.  Just wants to coast but still expects to succeed.  Often granted privileges and higher level work, without the hard promotion and raise associated.  Might randomly become partner out of nowhere someday, usually once the company finds out about their connections.*
5. The Specialist.  *Decides to focus on a niche skill within the company to ensure their utility and earn promotions.  Often becomes a bottleneck, ending up carrying a very high workload, but their pride and ability to gatekeep their position motivates them to put in the extra hours.  Promoted to senior levels, but never becomes an owner.*
6. The Number Two.  *High performing manager, very proud of how much they can make happen and how much value they bring to the company.  Has their eyes on ownership, but somehow never makes it because they are far more useful to the company in senior management, and they would rock the boat too much if they made it on the board and discovered how cozy the owners are.*

*--- ADD YOUR OWN! ---*

*  \#7: The Warm Body. Doesn't do much of anything, just sits there and collects a check. The company would get rid of him/her but they at least show up most of the time. Most likely to infuriate The Slack-Picker Upper. Good things are always their doing even if they had no hand in it. Nothing is ever their fault 
* \#8:  The Machine Whisperer. Could be mech, could be tech, could be both. Could be anything that gets the product out the door, paid for. Makes things work. Grasps processes, can troubleshoot trouble itself. Sees flow patterns, susses out bottlenecks. The company concierge. Has a constellation of networked peers. Gets It Done, or knows who can.  Knows her value, unafraid to insist on a new title and raise when new responsibilities are offered/adopted. Nearly indispensable, willing to walk at any time, everyone knows it, but she's cool about it. Doesn't condescend or bully. Might end up with an ownership stake, but will invariably bounce before the C-suite corner office.",1644359419.0

I've been following r/Antiwork since I got my new job over a year ago. I also joined r/workreform after the legendary debacle. I've been on the fence about asking for advice. I have no one and nowhere to turn to for help. I live on my own without family. This is why I’m here, to ask for advice from internet friends :\] I try to solve things on my own but I've decided I need mentoring, advice, guidance, resources or any kind of help! I’m 30yrs old with a BA in Business Administration. My long term goal over the next few years is to become a Certified Public Accountant. I am American, I live in Texas and I'm currently working at a manufacturing factory(no union), I’m in an \[At Will State\] ([https://www.dallasemploymentlawyer.com/at-will-employment-what-does-it-really-mean-in-texas/#:\~:text=The%20first%20thing%20you%20should,for%20no%20reason%20at%20all.&text=This%20means%20if%20you%20quit,not%20any%20law%20or%20contract](https://www.dallasemploymentlawyer.com/at-will-employment-what-does-it-really-mean-in-texas/#:~:text=The%20first%20thing%20you%20should,for%20no%20reason%20at%20all.&text=This%20means%20if%20you%20quit,not%20any%20law%20or%20contract)[.](https://www.dallasemploymentlawyer.com/at-will-employment-what-does-it-really-mean-in-texas/#:~:text=The%20first%20thing%20you%20should,for%20no%20reason%20at%20all.&text=This%20means%20if%20you%20quit,not%20any%20law%20or%20contract)) I've been working here for 1 year.

&#x200B;

My confidence is low but my determination is not.

tl;dr at bottom. Questions in **Bold**

&#x200B;

Four Questions:

&#x200B;

I.)  I have depression and disclosed this to my work place(I didn’t want to admit depression to HR but I was ready to quit my life and leave everything behind). I was given the accommodation of changing my working hours on Monday to better suit me. But now I am worried about the future and  if I will be punished for taking days off due to mental health. (Due to getting covid I used all my vacation/PTO days this year). Is it possible to take mental health days off without repercussions? (every two months I need a day to myself because I can not seem to deal with my stress/depression.) I asked my Doctor if I could have a written note excusing a day off, if I need it, but she seemed reluctant.. I also understand my depression status falls under HIPPA.

**Are there solutions to help me take a day off every month or two without repercussions due to my depression**?   This is my first time dealing with all of this.

2.) I would like to ask for advice, guidance or mentorship about resumes. Not the bare basics, but in this current market how to format a resume. I submitted 400+ resumes in the first 9 months of COVID. Through my experience I learned to have a template resume, switch out buzz words, websites to apply and keep a list of ready answers.

I will admit, I am severely discouraged with interviews. (I have tons of ready answers customized for interviews, I’m okay on that front, I think). I will link my resume (with scrubbed out locations). I am not good at getting past resume screening.

**What would be your advice on resume format, bullet points, key interest points, writing/spelling advice, and the best websites to apply to?** \[RESUME LINK\]([https://www.docdroid.net/efJczqE/sample-resume-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/efJczqE/sample-resume-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/efJczqE/sample-resume-pdf))) I am looking for a \*""remote data entry job, claims processor remote, customer service from home or remote.” thanks to u/FrapoleonDonutarde ‘s brilliant idea explained by u/Background-Wafer-636 \[HERE\]([https://ibb.co/rG4Xxdx](https://ibb.co/rG4Xxdx))

&#x200B;

3.) I’m the first person in my family to graduate with a bachelors and I am currently completing my Masters. I am the second person in my family to not have a dead-end job, I receive health insurance and have vacation/PTO days. I tell you this because I want to communicate that a lot of things are new to me, so I have a lot of worries. I cut off my family due to poor treatment and I have no one to direct my questions at :\[

My question/worry is: **When trying to transition/get a new job how do I keep my health insurance from being paused?** I have a medical problem along with my depression. The two medicines help me a lot. How does switching jobs affect my doctor or medicine prescriptions? I asked my doctor but she seemed confused that I was asking a “basic question” and did not know what to say..

4.) I work with Mexican ladies whose first language is Spanish. They’re really nice and a lot of fun! I negotiated my wage when I was hired and it seems I make $4 more than them for the same job. I want to provide adequate advocacy for them (in Spanish) but I don’t know how.. I worry about them because management comes off as rude and dismissive towards them. I am not bi-lingual. I speak broken texmex-spanish and I understand about 30%(Spanish) of what’s being said around me. (This company has people who speak English, Spanish, are bi-lingual or speak one language). **Does anyone know reliable resources I can provide for the Mexican Señoras so they can advocate for themselves?**

P.S.

Writing is not my strength.  Maybe's it's chrome being weird.. I suck at reddit hyperlinks..

Hey so I do HVAC and I’ve been at this specific company for the last 8 months but have been in this trade for about 3-4 years and I’m 35 years old. A little backstory they recently put me with a new lead (I’m an apprentice) he’s not the easiest to work with. He’s real lazy likes sitting in his truck all day when he does work he’s really immature and likes to blame any and everything on me. If I’m even five minutes late before texting me he texts our boss, when I ask if we’re working Saturday tells me no then texts me that night at 10pm saying that we are things like this have been consistently happening since I started working with him about a month and a half ago.  But this morning something really weird happened. I’m up getting around for work with my wife she’s getting our kids ready for school and my boss texts me asking me what is going on with our vehicle (forgot to mention that the night before this I had asked my boss for a $50 loan until payday due to my check being short from having to miss for Covid so he sent me $50 so I could fill up my gas tank) so I’m sure he’s pissed because I just borrowed that money to get to work and now he’s texting me asking me what’s going on. I text him back confused and he says that he got a message on the call in service that I was calling in today due to car issues. Now I didn’t even know there was a call in number I’ve always just texted my boss directly. I let my boss know this and all he says is that’s weird. What can I do? I could’ve lost my job from someone else calling me in or any ideas on what to do to maybe even figure out who called me in. They used my first and last name and only my boss and my lead have known that I’ve had car issues here lately, I don’t know anyone else at my company and don’t talk to any other guys there. I’m pissed because I could’ve lost my job and my family and I live off of my income. My children depend on my checks to have a warm home and food etc. I want to text my boss back to see what we can figure out about this but do any of you have any advice on how I should handle this. Also my lead has been gone the last two days on a side job which is a big no no. He is getting paid hourly and for the side job at the same time which you are clearly not suppose to do. Any advice or opinions on how to go about this would be great. Thanks!",1644354604.0

sns22l,New acquiring company is trying to trick me into working three jobs,24,0.89,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sns22l/new_acquiring_company_is_trying_to_trick_me_into/,5,"
Backstory, I was already working two people’s jobs during the pandemic because there was a bunch of layoffs prior to Covid. Our company got sold last year and it’s been a disaster, half of our team (I work in accounting) has quit in the past 4 months. But they haven’t replaced anyone, they’ve been just dumping work on my other two team members who are now working till midnight most days. 

 A few weeks ago, someone had put in their two-weeks notice. Our acquiring company, which exists in another state, flew out to our state and had everyone come into the office for a week (we have all been working remote since the pandemic) So I’m thinking, they’re going to listen to our grievances and hear us out to why we’re all quitting, right? Wrong, they pretty much popped their heads in once and said “let us know if you have any questions about anything” and bought us Panera a couple of times. Then, the new accounting manager popped his head in and said “Hey! Heard you were interesting in AR! Nice man…” to which I responded “…oh yeah?…” since I had never said that to him and then he goes “Yeah! Great! We’ll get you set up for training soon!” Shortly after, the person who is currently working this position comes in to tell me not to take her work because the new software is a disaster, no one is giving her any training, and there’s several people she has to get approval from to get anything through.

So I ask if I can speak with my new manager in private and voice my concerns. He claims he can get someone from the temp agency to fill my role immediately so I can take the new one. And yeah… sure… it’ll be rough at first because they won’t know all the nuances of my current role, so it’ll be hard in February…and, well, March too… probably April… maybe even May. And hey! I might even get a raise “somewhere down the line”! I also disclosed I was already so far behind in this month’s work because this translation has been a catastrophe. His response was basically “so what? Don’t even worry about it, who cares if people are reaching out to you asking for payment, no biggie!”  I told him no the next day and that they would need to hire someone else to fill that position. 

The following week the woman who is quitting told me she had an interesting conversation with someone who has been working there a long time. She basically said that this company has a tradition of dumping work on other people when workers quit and never hiring anyone to replace employees. People work long hours and weekends trying to get stuff done.

Fast forward to today, I get a call from the manager to see if I had given anything thought to the new role, otherwise they have to start looking for a replacement, even though I said no two weeks ago. I told him I had not changed my mind, but he still pushed and said he could get me an immediate raise. I said I would think about it and let him know tomorrow. Then, I get an email from him, subject reading: “Now here’s that award” with the body of it telling me what a great job I had been doing and an award for $500 that will be submitted to the CEO, which is pretty obviously in lieu of a pay raise. 

Anyways, I’ve been applying to other jobs and speaking with recruiters in the past week anyways. I just wanted to share to say don’t let companies pull bullshit on you. Go find employment elsewhere, let them fire you and collect unemployment, don’t slave your life away for some shitty job.",1644347215.0

>*""I’m unsure if anyone checks this box, but on the off chance that it is still in use, there is a strong need for these issues to be heard by the administration. From my own sentiments and from speaking to other teachers and staff, I can safely say that the employees of \[School\] are frustrated, depressed, and overall unhappy.*  
*The majority of staff are not being given the support, resources, or the respect that we need to continue working at this school. This isn’t something you can fix with free donuts in the kitchenette or a 30 minute staff meeting. It is time that grievances are aired and certain issues are dealt with properly instead of being swept under the rug. It is time to actually listen to the requests and feedback of every staff member.*  
*We are tired. Tired every day from the constant misbehavior that is inconsistently disciplined. Tired of using our own funds for projects. Tired of being made promises that are not kept. Tired of the “Dream Team” narrative which contradicts our reality. If we express our discontent with certain issues or school policies we are met with an “it’s fine”. It’s not fine. \[School\] was supposed to be different from \[public school district\], and it is, though possibly not for the better.*  
*The triggering event for me to write this letter would be the newly circulating rumors of wage theft, and the response from the administrative team to those accusations which has been damning. If you cannot support us, give us proper resources, or respect us, please at the very least pay us what we are legally owed.*  
*There is good reason why so many staff members have left this year, and it is not because of external factors. It is time to look inward before this sinking ship finds itself at the bottom of the ocean.""*

Two coworkers have left (or are currently finishing up their final days) experienced wage theft as far as I know. At least one of them is reporting the school to the state department of labor and the BBB. Overall this year we have lost 7 teachers.

 She told me that although she would love to, she can't. Starbucks does not do raises based on performance, there is a yearly raise that performance does not factor into. 

So I turn around and I'm chatting with my coworkers about how our performance does not matter since we are not compensated for it.

The assistant manager hears me since I am not attempting to be subtle, and I get called into the back to be told, ""you can't say that performance doesn't matter, you are wrong"" the manager is also there so I reconfirm that the yearly raise is not dependent on performance, and point out that there is no reason I should work harder than the minimum to not be fired. 
I get dumbfounded looks till I asked if there is anything else, and go back to the floor and continue to tell my coworkers that our performance does not impact our compensation.

snnl0r,Is this a gaslighting technique from a manager?,12,0.84,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/snnl0r/is_this_a_gaslighting_technique_from_a_manager/,13,"So just sharing my experience. I once worked at a well-known multi-national company that deals with medical equipments. I was under the marketing team and I was hired as a marketing associate with the marketing manager as my supervisor.

I know this is only one or two incidents but I recalled when she was orienting me during my 1st month, she was suddenly asking me ""what are the four P in marketing?"" Of course as someone who is a graduate of a degree in English, I had no idea what was the answer. I only had a few background on sales and marketing as well. I wasn't able to answer it and she said ""The four Ps are..."" then she continued it with a frustrated voice by saying ""You should've known this. You should do your research"" and I said ""I'm sorry. I didn't know it was part of the job"" (which is true I mean no one told me to research such terms during my orientation and training). She then replied ""Well it's not like I'm going to spoonfeed you or anything"" um okay...?

Another incident was I chose to work remotely on a Tuesday since working on-site is an option. My manager goes to the office on Tuesdays but it's her choice. When I messaged her I will be working remotely on that day, she didn't respond. Then when she was orienting me, she said ""Hey don't make it a habit of not going to the office on Tuesday"". HR and management never said going to the office on a Tuesday is mandatory. It's optional. I didn't like how I felt micromanaged.

Last incident (or incidents) is that every time I ask her about minor things, she pounds on the table lightly, makes face, or goes quiet for a few seconds cause she is pissed I can't understand and grasp the tasks and company system right away. It gave me huge anxiety and panic attacks. As I got home from the office, I cried really hard because I felt like I cannot do things right. Or one mistake made me feel like a bad employee.

When I told her I will resign after a month of working, her response was ""Okay I understand. I mean we were taking it step-by-step so you won't feel overwhelmed""

Either way, I am glad I got out. I wouldn't want to work with that type of management ever again.",1644335978.0

This applies to any folks here in the US who work in tech or aspire to work in tech.  The Computer Exemption laws as far as I am aware took effect January 1st, 2020 and are under the Fair Labors Standards Act.  Basically, if you work in a specialized technical field and make over a certain amount of money, the federal exemption tells you that you are not entitled to overtime pay at a 1.5 times rate as is the norm for other fields.

This is, obviously, bullshit and flies are n the face of the 40 hour week that many people literally died for, no matter how much you’re making.

Enter Pennsylvania: enshrined into law in PA and VERY FEW other states, is that PA does not recognize this exemption and in fact, whenever there is disagreement between FLSA guidelines and PA labor law, defaults to *whatever is more favorable for the employee, regardless of if it is at greater cost to the employer*.

I was able to point this out politely and had my overtime rate adjusted within an hour, with backpay coming on my next check, by my employer.

The message is this: PA has this right, and other states need to follow suit.  Our time is precious and valuable, and any infringement on rights that have been fought for, such as overtime pay, need to be defended.

Tech workers and aspiring techies: COME TO PA.  It is beautiful, you can buy a house for the price of a VCR, can be a short drive/train from DC or NYC, they will put French fries on your salad which I still find unacceptable, but moreover they will treat you more fairly than many states currently.

This makes me wonder: what other laws like this exist?",1644337925.0

The fight for disability rights for workers really needs to be something that is not significant focus. This is poised to become a critical issue for so many people who are being left to fight for themselves while they are too busy fighting their debilitating symptoms. 

Losing this much of the workforce is going to have a huge impact on workers' rights and how much leverage workers have when asking for fair pay and compensation.

For the love of Christ, SAY THE F***ING COMPANY’S NAME! THIS IS ALL FOR NOTHING IF WE DON'T KNOW AND EXPOSE THE OFFENDERS. Use a throw-away account if needed be, but the movement at large benefits from this information so people can avoid those companies and go through what you did.

2. You shall not give 2 weeks notice unless it it convenient for you or the employer earned it as a courtesy.  

3. If due to an accident or causes of nature, (gas leaks, unstable structures, tornado/hurricane, etc.) work becomes a safety hazard you may leave before the end of your shift, and without a need for permission.  

4.  You are an Adult. You can't 'Get In Trouble' and no employer has a right to 'Punish' you. [Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s0yh9i/you_are_an_adult_you_cant_get_in_trouble_and_no/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

5. Better to be fired (if there is no real cause, but some BS excuse the employer came up with) than to quit. You have been contributing towards your unemployment benefits. Use them when it is warranted.  

6. Be extra vigilant of being classified as a contractor vs an employee. There are very clear guidelines from the government that the employers must follow.  
&gt;[The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct *only the result of the work*, **not what will be done and how it will be done.**](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/understanding-employee-vs-contractor-designation). 

7. If you secure a new job with similar responsibilities to your current one, it is often better to leave, and not try to use the new offer as leverage to have your current employer increase your salary as you will be seen as an opportunist (hey, only employers can do that!) Life at work afterwards will seldom stay the same, in a detrimental way.  

8. Human Resources (HR) is there to represent the interests of the company. Your interests will be somewhat relevant as long as there is zero conflict/adverse result for the company, otherwise your needs and rights will come second or be totally ignored. Just remember what happened to a very smart guy in Facebook… [“It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all…” — quote starts at 1:25 but watch the whole thing for context.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y3NLNK72mzI). 

9. Any wage changes can only take effect in the future and are not retroactive (except possibly for overpayment or errors). Example: You give your 2-weeks notice or quit the same day, and the employer states they’ll reduce your pay to minimum salary for the remaining or accrued time. That is wage-theft and of course is illegal. [How To Report Wage Theft](https://www.employmentlawhelp.org/wage-theft/how-to-report). 

10. Your safety is #1. Blocked fire escapes, lack of safety gear and protocols, none should be ignored because of whatever BS excuse you are given — no budget, it’s a short project, etc. If in doubt, contact your local Fire Department, OSHA, or [other relevant government agency such as the NIH - Nat’l Institute of Health](https://ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/safety/incidents_accidents/Pages/Report-of-Unsafe-Condition.aspx) as you see fit. Complacency can result in harm or death for you or your colleagues.  
 
11. Take a break and explore some of the subjects listed so far in this list, and familiarize yourself with the laws that govern them: contractor vs employee status; wage theft; your state’s department of labor website (poking around may reveal subjects and rules that you were not aware of).  

12. High school and often college do not teach how to negotiate (salary/benefits). The onus is on you. Access here a few [book PDFs on the subject](https://www.pdfdrive.com/negotiation-books.html).  

13. When looking for work an employer should be able to provide you a **salary range** before you are required to submit a resume. Anyone who can't disclose the salary range up front should be seen as a risk of wasted time and potentially avoided all together. Oh, and get that in writing, even if it’s asking for a reply confirming what was stated in the phone inquiry/pre-interview, and the like.

14. Many bosses are learning and now monitor r/WorkReform so if needed be, create and post under a throwaway account.  

15. No pay, no stay. Staying after your schedule shift is over so the employer can guarantee your presence during inclement weather should entitle you to some form of compensation other than what you will be paid when the new shift hours begin. Because sadly is not the norm, if you ask (for the first time) and they state that you’ll get paid, again, try to get it in writing. Perhaps a text/email sent on the spot ‘thanking’ them for confirming the stated  remuneration. And remember, “there are instances when employers ask employees to work “off the clock” so as to avoid racking up overtime.” This is also wage theft. Go back and review item 9.  
  
Note: I started to consolidate these action items a while back with the idea of going back to the first WorkReform / AntiWork posts and consolidating what could be thought of as *best practices.* Well, time is not my friend and I don’t see that happening for a a few months or longer so i decided to post what i have so far.

- Didn't even think about planning for retirement until her late 50s. Was pleased to discover that she had a great pension (as well as a government one too) and hey all good, she'll be fine.


She could have made some different choices and been in an even better place, but for someone who really didn't get financially literate until later in life, she's done pretty well considering where she came from.

I have over 5 years warehouse experience. I have worked for two different major food manufacturers. I have since relocated to another state and have been seeking employment since my relocation.

I had been searching for a new job since the beginning of January, I thought I had lucked out when the recruiter reached out to me a couple of weeks ago. I had completed a virtual “interview” when I submitted my application. 

The “interview” consisted of a prompt question being asked, and recording yourself (on video, timed) with a response. I thought this is new, I have never had a virtual interview before. But with the pandemic still ongoing I could see it. 
 
The recruiter said the job was Monday through Friday, 9am-530pm almost unheard in the warehouse world. One of my previous jobs was constant forced overtime, every single day, with very little notice. I mentioned this to the recruiter that this was my biggest reason for resigning from my previous job, I wanted a job that was a set schedule. She said well, there is some overtime but there is always plenty of notice and overtime is rare.

The pay rate, $15 per hour (not too bad for Southern Ohio) is much less than I had hoped for but, I was honestly desperate and accepted the offer anyways. I was told be wear causal clothes, tennis shoes, as my first day would mainly consist of watching training videos and filling out paperwork. Pretty standard.

Upon arriving for my first day today, the woman in the front office acted like she wasn’t expecting me at all, and after I told her my name, she asked if I was there for the office position. I said no, I was there for the warehouse. She takes me into the warehouse to meet the manager. There was a big sign on the very first door before you walk into the office, “Masks are required in this facility”. 

I was the only person in the entire warehouse (including the woman in the office) who was wearing a masks today. 

He was sittting at his desk on the floor of the warehouse with a group of about 8-10 employees huddled around him. I’m introduced, and he says he will get with my in a second. Within 5 min of me being there, one of the guys just lights up a cigarette in the middle of the warehouse. Okay that’s weird I thought, the manager didn’t even look up, as if this was a common and okay thing.

After about 20 minutes of just standing there, the manager finally gets up, and formally introduces himself. He then asks if I have clocked in.

I said no, it’s my first day. No one told me I needed to clock in (most of the time in a warehouse, you have a paper sheet for your hours until you are in the system). We walk over and he gives me my employee number and I’m punched in. Right off the bat I just lost 20 minutes of pay because I wasn’t clocked in. 

He then brings me back over to the group of people huddled around his desk and asks who wants to train. I’m thinking okay I definitely wasn’t prepared for this. I wasn’t wearing the right shoes (no steel toe). Then I noticed no one was wearing steel toed shoes at all. I was slipping and sliding all over the place all day. 

I worked from 9am till 1pm without a single break. 1pm was lunch time, I was granted a 30 minute lunch, unpaid, then back to work. The only other break I got was when I needed to use the bathroom. 

I got to speaking with the guy training me, once I was comfortable enough. I noticed it was about 4:30pm almost time to go I thought. I mentioned this to him and he kind of chuckled and said oh no we aren’t even close to being done. He then said most of the time they do not finish until 7pm or 8pm. Sometimes even 9pm. 

I was shocked and said that I was told this was an 8 hour shift and then went to talk to the manager. 

He told me that “recently” it’s been 8 hour shifts but it all depends on volume and it’s never consistent. I told him that I’m only working 8 hours today and that’s all I was prepared to do. 

I left after 8 hours and sent an email to HR, listing everything that I have here. And resigned from the position.

I was lied to multiple times. Although money may be tight for me for a month or two, I will not accept horrible working conditions, on top of being lied to and mislead.

Edit: Since a few have asked or guessed: Yes, it was Keurig/Dr. Pepper. I have reported them to the Ohio Department of Health for a smoke free workplace violation.

Edit 2: I was contacted by the regional HR. She is over Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. They are going to do a thorough investigation on my complaints. I doubt anything will happen but maybe the next guy they decide to hire hopefully won’t have a bad first day like me. She did ask me if I was sure about resigning and if I made up my mind. Of course I said yes, my mind is made up.",1644295363.0

I was a temp to perm hire a year ago, and slowly took on more during my temp period so that I could remain with the company. Its a good one, their minimum wage is excellent, benefits are not so much, work from home is great. Upon becoming a permanent employee, I was quickly asked to coach new hires. A few months later, I'm agreeing to straight up train new hire classes. For all my efforts, I got a 1k per year salary increase. I make $0.58 more than the people I just trained. I was strung along with promises that compensation would come, and I feel foolish to have agreed, but I need more money for everything I've been doing and intend to keep doing for my company. I like my new responsibilities, I like the people I work with and have trained, and I'm doing my best to support them.

Additionally, when I receive an email from my boss in the evening or weekend I control my response. I usually write my response but do a schedule send to the next business morning.

It's a great long read but in case it's too long (it is long!) I summarized it for all of us!

**TL;DR:**

* **Since 2017, private-equity backed firms like Greystar have done rapid takeovers of apt. buildings all over the US. Private equity takeovers of housing has led to soaring rents (sometimes +25% in a year), no hot water sometimes, the PE firms not paying for trash pickup (leaving scattered trash everywhere) and reducing security guard patrols.**
* **Of 35 biggest multifamily apt building owners, now almost HALF of the owners are private equity.**
* **These PE firms flip these buildings, then unload them for profit. These PE-led apt. housing funds try to return 20% compared 4% for regular real investment trusts. Greystar CEO Bob Faith has bragged about these returns.**
* **Freddie Mac has enabled these firms, accounting for 85% of biggest apt. bldg. purchases. After Freddie issues the loan, it allows PE firms to jack rent with no tenant protection. Blackstone was also accused of tenant abuse in 2017.**
* **Biggest PE firms involved have been Greystar, Southern Management, Lone Star, Irvine Co. and Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, & Starwood Capital. Both Goldman & Starwood were implicated in fraud in ANOTHER ProPublica study called ""The Bigger Short"" on commercial real estate fraud.**
* **Firms like Blackstone fight regulation; they spent nearly $83 million in California to fight rent control measures, 3x their opponents'.**
* **This is happening under a housing crunch over the past few years, as many of these firms took advantage of the boost in renters from the 2008 crash, and even more so now during the pandemic.**

So she does these arbitrary tasks and her manager tells her ""oh yeah you should be getting promoted since you're working on what you should be."" 

But all of a sudden we learn today that they're giving this promotion to her former coworker instead since he's coming back for a ""Rumored"" pay raise of $16/hr. This is COMPLETE BS!! Congrats to him for getting ahead, but seriously? Are you guys gonna screw her even though she has tenure on this guy? All because they felt it would be a ""better choice"".

So finally she says: ""Well I could still get this position because he only works 2 days a week and he's gonna be working on my off days."" 

I say: ""Okay, are they gonna match your pay? If not it's time to go.""

She says: ""Well I love my job and I don't want to start anything""

what I said next was a little harsh and I apologized for it but I feel that I had to be straight with her.

I said: ""I'm really sorry that I'm about to get ugly with you but IF THAT JOB AIN'T PAYING NO BILLS IT DON'T MEAN JACK SHIT IF YOU LOVE IT!""

Right now she plans on asking if they will match the pay and she is filling out applications in her ACTUAL DREAM JOB as I type

sn5nsy,What is it that you actually want? Part 1: Hours in a standard work week,66,0.91,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sn5nsy/what_is_it_that_you_actually_want_part_1_hours_in/,125,"*Preface*

If we want actual, actionable change in our work lives, then our goals need to be quantitative in nature. Telling someone we want ""less working hours"" is great and all, but no one can act on it. Telling someone we need ""better working conditions"" is a good start, but it is an empty request that won't be fulfilled. I think it's important that this sub develops goals that are both quantifiable and actionable with the end goal of changing the culture of work in America. 


*Part 1: The New Standard Number of Hours in a week*

Let's start with the number of hours one should be expected to work in a standard work week. IOW, how long should a standard work week be? Currently it is 40 hours/week, which we believe is too much. So what is our magic number? What is the number that will make almost all of us happy?

I am here to pitch to all of you that 30 hours/week should be the new standard work week. In addition to the reduction of time committed to your job each week, employers can be more flexible with how they schedule hours in a typical week. If a company wanted to keep a 5 day work schedule, then our hours would be cut to 6 hours/day. But companies could also schedule 30 hours of work Monday-Thursday (7-8 hours/day) if they wanted to try a 4 day work week.


*Conclusion*

I hope to hear everyone's thoughts on what they believe the standard work week should be. Your background and your experiences are significant to the change we want to see. I used to be a teacher and it's truly amazing how many teachers (and students) get burnt out during a school year. Ofc there are a billion of other things wrong with the system of education in America, but one can notice that a school's hours of operation correlate to the number of hours in a standard work week. But going back to my original point, my perspective is so one-dimensional. I don't have experience in construction or in fast food or in retail. I've never worked in a hospital. And while *I* don't have these experiences, *WE* do.

Lastly, not only do I hope this post generates discussion, but I hope we can slowly start to update the core beliefs on this sub. I'd like to see (for example) ""We demand the standard work week is reduced to 30 hours"" instead of ""we should work less"".

I look forward to your comments. Whatever it is you do or wherever it is you live, you are important here and your contribution is valuable.

Over the past 3 years it's become almost impossible to buy so I won't be talking about buying, just renting. Even now the house I am in currently, which isn't mine, went from 149k brand new to resell of almost 500k. That's why I'm not going to talk about buying.

So I looked for just a one bedroom apartment. Cheapest one I found that actually is almost never available because how ""cheap"" it is would be 995 a month 700 sqft. You would have to pay utilities. Normally cheapest I've been able to find over the last year range from 1100 to 1300 for same size. Let's go with the 995 one though.

Minimum wage being 7.25 you would bring home about 1160 before tax. Based off when I was single and no kids and did my w4 how it was recommended I was taxed 200 per check. Don't know if it's normal or not but I'm going to go with that. So let's take the 400 out and you are left with 760. Only 760 to try and live for a month. Can't afford even the cheapest 1 bedroom apartment with that.

Let's look at 15 an hour. Same apartment and everything. If you work 8 hours every work day you bring home 2400 before tax, using the same tax as above we will take 400 out with tax leaving 2000. Let's take rent out of 995. 1005 left. Utilities I will count power, gas, and internet because it's pretty much a necessity now so let's say sparingly 200 a month for utilities which it's on the low side but we will go with it. 805 left. Water is paid for by landlord.

Let's just get some basic stuff now. Car insurance I'll say 100 because that's what I got my rate at first starting out. We will do 80 for gas for the car and thats just for work. Cellphone bill of 75. We are at 550 left. Now food. With current food prices I'd say 300 a month for food for a single person. 150 for 2 weeks seems pretty reasonable. Of course could live off Ramen if you wanted but I'm thinking a ok meal for every meal. 

Now we are at 250 left. That's not counting streaming stuff and the odd and end stuff let alone health insurance but it's enough to get by. Now that 1 bedroom apartment has gone up by 100 a month every year. Last year it was 895. So if prices keep inflating like they are currently, this single person would be able to live at this place for at max 2 years with rent, food, utilities, and gas cost going up. 

My point? 15 an hour would be only be sustainable for a year, maybe 2. If we are going to fight to change minimum wage, we need to look at the actual long term. Minimum wage is supposed to be liveable and to me, a single person trying to live in a one bedroom apartment that is in no way shape or form fancy or upgraded or in a prime spot to live should be the staple of liveable. Not good but liveable.",1644261531.0

Cool fair enough. 

But around 3 weeks ago they scheduled me for Thursday last minute (I only work mondays fridays and Saturday’s). Of course I didn’t come in. I had no idea, 

The boss proceeds to lecture me about looking at the schedule, I didn’t say anything and just went on with my day.

Come about 2 weeks ago my boss talks to me about switching me to fridays again, ok cool no problem. Come last week i got told I no called no showed in thursday.

I asked them what in the world is happening, and they told me I got switch backed to Thursdays. They apparently changed the plan that very week **WITHOUT TELLING ME**

And that’s not all.

One of the co workers was out last week, so I had to come in no problem. Boss told me ahead of time so it’s no issue. (I can’t work Sunday’s because of church and my parents where religious but I explained it to them.)

Come today I had to call out because I was throwing up, my boss scolds me for not showing up yesterday (yesterday was Sunday). I explained to her, I don’t work sundays and I came in last week because you told me. But no one told me this week. 

She told me check the schedule. I told her you specifically told me multiple times to not listen to the schedule and only listen to you, and **you never told me to work yesterday just last sunday**


Then she proceeded to tell me just to always check the schedule and ask.

The concept of ownership of a person by another and the result dehumanisation of the slave. Awful by all means, and great that it has ended (mostly). 

But if we think about, everything that made it slavery is still here – it just modernized itself and left the physical realm to enter the psychological one. 

We are still shackled. Shackled by debt, by the need to buy a house which takes decades to pay.

A person doesn't own us. Banks and companies do. Indirectly, but they do. We are not legally property. But are almost treated like it. 

We are always free to leave a job, change career, change countries. But what are the alternatives really? Leave everyone we love behind? Change careers when we spent years and countless money investing in a degree and getting that experience? Going for a high risk high chance of failure entrepreneurship path? And with what energy? With what money? Go live in the woods and become a paleolithic, some say, you're free to do that. So, a social outcast. Is that a good alternative, really?

People get home too emotionally and mentally tired to do anything else. Maybe the body is not tired, and wounded from whips and sore muscles. But the mind certainly is. It's wounded from feeling hopeless, drained of feeling pointless, exhausted of getting squeezed. The company has to achieve the yearly targets after all. 

And the boss thanks everyone for their hard work and that we need to keep fighting. That it was a though year but we can't rest just yet. Blablabla. Not a physical whip. It's one more sophisticated, made of psychological manipulations derived from greed, disconnection from fellow human beings and lack of empathy.

Waking up everyday, day after day, lots of people lonely, many with triggers and traumas, with little to look forward to but another grey day that hopefully goes by quickly to enjoy a few minutes of rest before repeating itself again. This is mental torture by any measures. 

People are told the system is fine, it's just that they need to stop eating avocado toasts and save on their gym memberships and they too will stop being poor. In psychology we have a term for this technique in abusive relationships – victim blaming. Or if you prefer, DARVO – Deny, Attack and Reserse Victim-Offender.

The modern landscape equates not a physical abusive relationship, like we're used to associate with slavery, but an emotionally abusive one. And it's time we start realising the real severity of the situation. Emotional slavery is as bad than physical. Dying mentally is as valid death as dying physically. Those who only exist but don't live, are already dead.",1644248402.0

I was 17/18 at the time and at college (UK, so Sixth Form).

I found a second part time job at the local football stadium that was every other Sunday 15:00-18:00 (match day). I had to ask my manager if he would be able to let me finish my Sunday shift 15 minutes earlier every other week, giving me enough time to get over to the football stadium. I explained that if he couldn’t do that, it’s fine because it wasn’t that far away, and they were quite flexible so likely to let me push my start time back by 10 mins or so. 

He said “if you had just asked me without telling me that reason, I’d have said yes, but now I find out you’ve got a second job I am questioning your loyalty to us. You either leave that job or I’ll fire you”.

I immediately said “okay, I will return my uniform tomorrow, I’m not working for someone who thinks they can control my time outside of work hours”. And looking back, I am happy that I reacted so quickly.

It was a shit situation because Domino’s paid a lot more than a few hours at the footy every other week, but there had been loads of things pissing me off about Domino’s and that was the final straw.

Couple of examples of what else had happened:

1) I washed my hands any time I had touched my face or hair and the guys would all taunt me saying “why are you washing your hands so much, we only work with pizza it’s not heart surgery”.

2) 90% of the time I worked on the tills and answering the phones, nowhere near the food, but they made me wear a blue plaster over my nose piercing whereas all the men had ear piercings and they didn’t have to cover them. A (male) customer commented once that it was unfair they made me do this but didn’t do it themselves.

3) There were rats in the basement where the dough was stored and the manager laughed about it (I should have reported this but I was terrified of the work environment and people I worked with).

4) My supervisor used to text me asking me for (NSFW) >! blow jobs in the basement during the next shift !< and this was relentless, and the team would all discuss the texts and laugh at my ‘prudeness’.

They only hired me to meet the gender equality threshold, and would tell me that often.

You guys have probably seen me post here before but I'm running out of steam. I love my job I genuinely do, but I'm very recently getting to a point where I just can't do it anymore. 

  It really started when I got sick. It's not covid but because it was covered symptoms I have to take off the 5 shifts. That ended 3 days ago but I've called off all 3 days because I just can't get on the other side of this sickness.  My parents raised me with a very suck it up and go into work attitude, comma but I work in hospitality which means I am dealing with a lot of people on a daily basis and cleaning their rooms, So that ramps up the tension for me. As well as the feeling of responsibility if I get someone sick. In the past 60 hours I've gotten about 6 hours of sleep gi ve or take, And with a bunch of personal family drama also happening right now I'm a bit On edge as far as my depression goes. 

This isn't the 1st time that this has happened to me. Very often I'll work a job for a few months before I get overwhelmed by it.  I've considered trying to go on some form of disability but because my issues armental I don't know if they would be counted, Especially because I have worked several jobs in the past.  

 As of right now I don't know what to do. I can't keep calling out of work or I will lose my job, But I can't keep doing my job, But I can't have no income either. I guess I'm somewhat venting in somewhat asking for any advice. 

Tl;dr:  I'm Sick and my depression is going nuts, And I've called off of work 3 days in a row, And I don't know how I can stand to go back.

smfe55,"Don't take ""tuition assistance"" programs seriously; from someone who made that mistake",117,0.96,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/smfe55/dont_take_tuition_assistance_programs_seriously/,30,"TL;DR at the bottom.

A decade ago I was in my freshman year at university working towards my bachelor's degree when I applied for one of these jobs that offered to ""pay for my degree."" I was racking up debt, so this seemed like a great opportunity. I was offered an interview, but it was during the final exam period in my spring semester. I talked to my professors, told them what an amazing opportunity this was, and they were willing to be flexible and let me take my finals early. I made my interview and got the job. This job was in another city from my current school, but ""no problem"" I thought. I just moved and started working on transferring my credits.

A month into working, I went to HR to apply for help paying for school in the subsequent fall semester. When I talked to the same person I had interviewed with (who I had told about my interest in this tuition assistance program) they only then informed me about the stipulations:

1) It was tuition reimbursement, not tuition payment. This meant I had to float the company thousands of dollars until the end of the semester. Then they'd pay for any of the classes for which I received a B- or higher. That kind of liquidity was hard to achieve given my income ($12.50/hour).

2) It was only available to employees who had been there for 6 months, so I wasn't even eligible to apply until another semester away from school.

3) They would only pay for a degree in something relevant to the company's interests. Due to the nature of our work, this meant computer science or something that'd put me in HR.

4) It would only cover $4000/semester, which was about enough to cover community college full time or state school part time.

5) It was only available to people working full time, meaning I could only go to school part time anyway. This meant that the remaining 3 years of my degree program would've taken about 6 years of my life.

6) If I left the company within 5 years of reimbursement, I would have to pay every penny back to the company. I would be indebted for half a decade after graduation. So all together this meant I'd be working at this company for the next 11 years.

7) If I was written up for any infraction at work, I wouldn't be eligible for the program.

Each stipulation on its own sounded reasonable, and I was a naive 19 year old, so I went along. After all, I had been taught that good things come to those who work hard, and I was willing to work hard. In the subsequent semester I took off from school, I picked up about 15 hours/week of overtime (on top of 40 hours/week) and was promoted twice. The OT helped me build up my nest egg to pay for classes up front.

In the following spring semester, I started a community college class with the goal of earning my degree ""the right way."" I wanted to ease back into school, and did well balancing my time (draining as it was). After my first semester, I received my check to help pay for my class. Woo!

For the next fall semester I signed up for three classes. It was a full load, but if I ""put the work in"" I could make it happen. And I was going to school for free, while meeting all of the expectations at work. I was doing it ""the right way."" Until I wasn't. You see, I used my phone at work to text my brother. Not about anything damaging to the company, not in front of a customer, and not something I hadn't done 1000 times in the previous 8 months while working at the company. The same 8 months in which I had exceeded every performance metric they had and earned multiple promotions and raises. Nevertheless, the company caught my violation a month into my second semester, and wrote me up. I was out thousands of dollars for tuition, and had just wasted over a year of my young adult life on this opportunity. My nest egg was gone, my bank account empty, and I had 12 credit hours to show for a year and a half's worth of work and then some.

At that point in my life, I had a positive role model that broke down my options in a way that made sense: even assuming that the company hadn't deliberately screwed me, moving through school at a snail's pace on their terms wasn't worth the delay. What they paid, plus the tuition assistance program, totaled about $30,000/year. That amount of money sounded nice to have in hand, especially at that age, but I needed to consider that the degree I was pursuing was going to afford me at least twice that salary on the open market. That meant that every year I wasn't finished with my degree was costing me a similar $30,000/year. That'd make for $90,000 in lost earnings by delaying my education an extra 3 years. Not to mention I'd be locked in at the company an extra 5 years after graduation, meaning they'd have no incentive to pay me a competitive salary. The company wouldn't have to offer competitive salaries if they were competing with no one, meaning I'd be losing even more money.

TL;DR: Don't go out your way to work for a company that offers ""tuition assistance"" or ""corporate scholarships."" They wouldn't offer you money unless it was benefiting them financially in the long term, and in the long term they're going to get their value out of you. Not to mention, they'll probably find a way to screw you and not pay you at all.",1644202666.0

Thought yall would be interested in hearing about some of the employee policies that have been implemented since the company has gone public.

The most important has been the enforcement of the AOV (average order value) policy. The policy requires each employee to have an average sale value of over $200, keep in mind the companies constant advertisement of $95 prescription glasses. The company isn't concerned with total sells or even individual sales, the company insists only on profit margins per sale.

Employees are put on ""the list"" if their AOV drops below $200 for more than 2 consecutive weeks, if they are unable to bring the number up after 30 days, they will be terminated.

The company offers no benefit for reaching the goal just repercussions. This policy is not part of the training or orientation, you only learn about the basics in your first few days, and of course, HR isn't at all transparent about this suggesting that if you are ""educating"" the customer properly it shouldn't be a problem. This is obviously highly misleading as the entire platform incentives upselling glasses additions to TWISE the advertised price or risking termination.",1644201784.0

I got let go from my dream company in  late 2017. I was crushed. I have a college degree. I worked very hard to be employed for that company and I have no hard feelings there.

Surprise pregnancy (another long story but basically I'm a single mom) a few months later and got a job as a janitor at a hotel. It wasn't a bad job, I got left alone. I worked up until 2 days before I went into labor. I got six weeks off unpaid (did get w2 thankfully).  The hotel ""break room"" was a office chair in the laundry room. While I was out on FMLA the hotel swtiched GM's as things were declining (people not getting paid etc). The new GM must not have liked me as they decided that I wasn't doing my job. When I first started I was given a paper list and keys. The new gm wanted me to get ""more training"". Hello my old friend the paper list. They also decided that I needed to work past midnight which I couldn't with my daycare closing at 11.

They reduced  my hours from 25 to 10. One time I was asked to mop the stairs and I did, and IDK when they checked, but they found a soda can, and I broke down sobbing cause I didn't want to lost my job with a 2 month old. They didn't care. Oh and I was supposed to wash the walls of the bathroom. Not even joking. I found a job at a group home basically the same day my hours got reduced.

&#x200B;

I only stayed at the group home 90 days because there was zero safety for the staff. I was alone in a house with 4 schizophrenics with a history of violence most days. They usually were just like little kids asking a million questions when I got on shift. If they would have gotten violent I only had 2 options: let them hurt me or run.

&#x200B;

Thankfully a company in my degree hired me and I worked there for a year and a half. They struggled with the transition to virtual with the pandemic. They went from being a  really great caring company to letting hundreds of people go with zero warning when they got bought out. It was a monday, and we were locked out of everything, no chance to hand anything in progress off, no goodbyes and we didn't do anything, we just were no longer needed.

&#x200B;

I'm back as a janitor again, and my dream company hired me back, I'm over the moon. I don't mind the janitorial, but mandatory attendance is annoying. I clean a school, and even if school is cancelled due to cold etc, I still have to come and clean yet.

smcnv6,Rant #I lost count,13,0.93,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/smcnv6/rant_i_lost_count/,5,"Hey everyone,

I am not sure if this kind of post is allowed, but I need to get some things off my mind.   


Truth be told, I haven't been here much since everyone split off from antiwork.I rarely go on facebook anymore, I mainly stick to twitter. Today, I realized why. I read two things today, one news story about Starbucks employees trying to unionize, and another about a dude who got his hours cut because he could not come to work.   


Now, as to the first one, they wanted to unionize due to poor working conditions, essentially corporate not controlling the input of mobile orders. One of the workers who was interviewed said that at the peak, they have gotten 50 mobile orders at once right at opening, on top of who comes through the door in person. Getting 50 orders at once, AND dealing with face to face customers, that is rough, very, very rough. Hell, that is just bullcrap. Getting half that would still suck.   


And what gets me is the comments. A lot of people were sympathetic. But most were mocking them, decrying unions and basically saying ""suck it up and do your job"". And I will be willing to bet that none of these people have worked in that industry before. I get it, mobile orders are not going away. It's new technology, and people like and are adapting to it. But there has to be limits.   


The second one is on a group I am in that hits closer to home. It is a group for cooks and chefs who have worked in the restaurant industry. I myself worked in the food industry, and various restaurants since I was 16. This one straight pissed me off. This guy said that he got his hours cut because his car was buried in the snow and could not get to work. Now, anyone who lives in the north knows that a bad snow CAN do this. Hell, even 6 inches is rough, and the plows don't always get to the roads right away, let alone the suburbs and back roads. There are some places that straight up warn people to stay off the road.   


Now, this one was slightly better. Slightly. A dozen or so people were sympathetic, but most of them, people IN THE INDUSTRY were saying he deserved it, and needed to get to work. These are people who have probably been where he is at. Not only that, they mocked him for his political alignment, and sexuality. One of the people on his side said something I really hope he saw.   


""Your boss will have your job up to be filled before your obituary hits the news"".   


That is so true. It drives me up the wall that its not just the work industry as a whole that needs to be changed AND the people who use the services, but our fellow workers who are actually in the various industries itself need to be reformed. People are quitting left and right, and society STILL refuses to accept there is a problem. They are starting to lose business AND money, and they still refuse to accept there is a problem. New unions are being formed, and they STILL refuse to accept there is a problem. I just wonder, what is it going to take?",1644194744.0

Which is completed bullshit as dining is full thurs, fri, and sat. I’ve been talking to my coworkers about their situation as well. It turns out that at least two of my coworkers (there are probably 8 people working per shift for the kitchen) are being paid DISHWASHER WAGE while they cook on the line (which is a completely different occupation)or prep food work. Manager also dismisses health concerns caused by stress of employees “just show up”. They have also been promised raises but not got anything.

Currently everyone is making 13 and hour and we’re thinking about saying 15 or no work from  any of us. Because of how much we get taken advantage of, we are vital to the restaurants functionality, and if they said no they would at least have to close for a couple of days.

All the people that leave after a year are clearly quitters?? lol...

One thing that I find isn't often talked about is the physical and mental toll of being in a high-stress job where you are constantly at odds with the leadership in your organization.

Things really hit a low point for me over the past summer, after five years of high stress, incredibly adversarial employment I had put on 60lbs. I developed an autoimmune disorder which was linked to stress, which meant I was hobbling around with a cane most days. My family life and relationship with my children was suffering as I was just ""tapped out"" for patience after a day of work.

I decided enough was enough and got serious about my health. Firstly my physical health, I started doing intermittent fasting and I'm happy to say I'm 40lbs lighter, I've almost erased the physical damage that job did to my body.

Quit a week ago and the stress just melted away, in a much better place with the family and although it's not like flipping a literal switch, I'm much less grouchy and irritable at home and am enjoying my kids and my free time. The autoimmune disorder went into almost complete remission and I can play with my kids and clean the house etc no problems now.

New job is great, awesome boss and a lot of flexibility and autonomy so I'm excited to see where this goes.

If you happen to be far from one of the company offices, they made you report in at a sister company office daily. I was hired full remote more than 6 years ago, and they applied this to me too.

I took a new job as a consultant making a little less money as the base salary, but family insurance premiums are fully covered, and we get commissions based on billable hours.

The COO called to ask plainly if I plan on sticking around more than a week. In his words, there is this ""great resignation"" going on and he's having trouble keeping people on-board. Employees will leave after a few weeks or just not show up at all. I told him that I'm not actively looking and left it at that. When interviewing, after getting an offer, I did mention that I'm concerned with the effective pay cut until I'm ramped up and making commission money. Plus the fact that commissions are paid following the month they're earned. His answer was that he's also losing a lot of money for my ramp up time because I'm not billable.

Because I think people need to be more open about pay, I made 130k as a Sr Engineer for a Fortune 500 company. This consultant gig pays 114k base, but after insurance premiums are covered and commissions, it comes out to around 135-140k.

To any managers, directors, or executives that read posts here: loyalty is still a thing.

sm2mug,Small Businesses Suck Too!,31,0.88,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sm2mug/small_businesses_suck_too/,15,"I always heard that working for a Small Business would be better because you'll be treated better and paid better, but honestly for me, they have been just as bad as the corporate jobs I've had!

Some backstory, I went to school for Graphic Design. I got stuck in retail for 5 years because no one would give me a chance because I didn't have the work experience in my field. I applied for an office job for a small company, that also liked my Graphic Design background. (Probably because she didn't want to pay an experienced designer.)  


I worked for one small business from 2019-2021 and the owner of the company was the Queen of Micromanaging, she'd get mad at you for writing a post it note ""Wrong"". She was also very rude and belittled me all the time, I hated working for her. It's a shame because I really liked my coworkers and wouldn't have left if she didn't exist. 

I also know for a fact that I was the lowest paid employee in the company, and I think it's because she didn't see Graphic Design as a ""real"" job. The only time she tried to give me a raise, was when I gave my two weeks. lol (I was there for two years and never got a raise, I made 14 an hour pretty much the whole time. \[Minimum wage went up, so I got an extra dollar a few months before I left.\] Apparently her excuse was, she didn't give raises because that's when the pandemic started) She offered me 20 an hour to stay, but I didn't take it because I just could not stand her! I'd drive to work mad, because I would think of all the rude things she'd say to me.  


So I left that small business in May 2021, to get another job for a small company as well. It was pretty much the complete opposite of the last job. Very laid back, the owner was always 20 minutes late so I had to wait in my car for him to open the door. (Where as with the micromanager, she'd get mad at you for being a minute late!).   


I didn't vibe with my coworkers at this job, so for the most part, my boss and coworkers pretty much ignored me. What really upset me though, I was hired for Social Media Manager/Graphic Design, but pretty much became Customer Service. I was doing Social Media, Graphic Design and Customer Service, while only making 17 an hour. I was doing the job of three people, while being underpaid!  


This job had it's own set of issues, but I didn't pay much attention to it because I wasn't working for a toxic boss anymore.  


Anyways, so last week, he let me go. Just like that, I didn't get any notice, no two weeks, nothing. No discussion on how I felt about my position, etcc... Just, today is your last day! The reason? He didn't think Social Media was bringing him sales. Which it did at-least get him one sale. But also, I was always stuck doing everything else, I never had time to update the Social Media accounts or make a Content Marketing Strategy. I was always stuck helping customers, so of course we didn't make many sales that way!   


I was stunned! I had done so much for his company, I always felt like that Sabrina the Teenage Witch meme, where she has like 8 plates of pancakes in her face and she doesn't know where to start!

It's funny because in the beginning of January, I was out for 5 days because I was sick. He asked if I could come back to work, while still sick and wear a mask because he needed me. But a month later, he doesn't need me anymore?!

Small Businesses seem to be just as bad as corporations and honestly, I kind of want a corporate job again. Mainly because you get benefits and more days off as well since Small Businesses can't always afford to have extra days off.

And even more irritating I, as well as the rest of the people on my team work from home a few days a week and the clock in system is GPS tracked and won’t allow you to clock in outside of the business location. Many times that has created headaches and errors for me and my team since we didn’t get full paychecks and I’m hounding my boss in upper management to adjust our times, or give me access to adjust the times for my self and my team. My tin foil hat is that they’ve been doing this since they don’t want anyone working from home anymore and want us all in office everyday.

We never had more than 4, and it was primarily because of our horrendous human resources.

For most of the time we only had three people, so four open spots. One person was only capable at best of doing one person worth of work, so two of us were working ourselves to the bone doing three people worth of work. HR wouldn't let us hire four people, they'd let us hire ONE, get them onboarded, then start the process to hire another. However HR took so long to process resumes that we'd be getting resumes SEVEN MONTHS after a job opening had been published. This means when I called people to inquire if they were still interested, 90% said ""No, I found another job already."" So already our applicant pool was limited to people who had been searching for a job for more than half a year. 

So we were looking at an onboarding time of about nine months, from the publishing of a job opening to getting someone in the office and starting to learn the job. However whenever we got a fourth, the first would have burnt out and quit, and we're back down to three, and the cycle repeats. My best supervisor in that position spoke about having more satisfaction being a food delivery driver on weekends than his office job. He quit after seven months, having moved his whole family from two states away to take the job.

And then one day I'm driving into work, so stressed out that I'm about to have a preemptive argument with my steering wheel over the nonsense from the previous day, and my chest starts hurting. It starts hurting REALLY bad. I try to feel my pulse but I can't seem to find it. I ask my phone what are the signs of a heart attack, and it lists what I'm feeling. I figure I'm 5 minutes away from work, I'll drive there and then figure out if I go to my office or the emergency room. I was so beaten down by my work that even as my life might be fading from my body, I was worried about my emails piling up.

I get to a parking spot, fall out of my car, and stagger to the emergency room. My heart was in full afibrilation, beating randomly and thus not pumping blood correctly. They manage to get it under control before they had to shock me, but it was quite scary. I realized that day that something had to change, and that was the day I went from doing 3 people worth of work... to one person worth of work. My boss could get as mad as she wanted, give me negative reviews, raise the plight of the veterans affected until she was blue in the face. I spent four years willing to die for my country, that condition ended when I was discharged from the military.

So with my new attitude, things weren't at least stressing me to the point that I was screaming at my steering wheel on the way home every day, but I was still deeply unhappy and unsatisfied. There was no room for promotion, and the work felt like something that should be automated away. The department was melting down on a regular basis, but I didn't care, they had no leverage over me because the broken hiring process meant firing me would only mean dumping even more work on the person doing five people worth of work.

But then... it all collapsed. The hospital decided to have an 'emerging leaders' conference, getting one person from each department into a class to have 'motivational speakers' and 'group exercises' to prepare them for leadership roles. This was a mistake, because each person they brought had been successfully gaslit by their bosses that ""Only our department is having these problems, you need to work harder so we can get out of these problems and on par with everyone else."" Let the people talk between departments and... oh no... it's all the departments dealing with the self-sustaining understaffing and being worked to the bone to keep departments afloat. We realized we were all being held to a standard of work that had NEVER been met, nor could it be met. That class resulted in a lot of broken motivational speakers and resume polishing, within a month half the people in that class had quit the hospital. The class is what made me get serious about putting my resume in for other positions, and I'm so glad I did.

Fortunately for the past two years I have been working my dream job in environmental protection, my work is so satisfying that at points my expression can be described as 'disney villain grin' while processing enforcement actions, my coworkers and boss are incredibly supportive and we all want to specifically be in this job. Also a promotion of about 50% my previous pay, to the point that ""A larger paycheck would not affect my quality of life."" It's also one hell of a bullet dodge that I quit my job at a hospital a month before COVID hit, because the hospital didn't allow people to telework.

The idea is to highlight typical emotional abuse companies do at work. For example:

* **Putdowns/belittling accomplishments -** Such as attacking your self esteem so badly you don't apply for better jobs because you don't know the value of you and your work. 
* **Intimidation/Fear** \- by telling you they'll blacklist you on every company, provide bad references or make sure you can't work in the area again if you try to leave/resign or have bullying issues.
* **Guilt Tripping**  you into working without pay or safety by saying you should do it ""because we're a family company that needs to help each other"" or ""if you don't you'll be hurting another coworker"". or ""this is what the job is"".
* **Shutting down problematic communication -** like stopping people from talking about pay or problems at work, firing them for speaking out against bullying, or worse!
* **Financial abuse** \- don't do as I say? ""Good luck suriving/providing for your family/having a home to live in etc""",1644141638.0

My company is usually rather small - at our “height” in terms of personnel we had around 6 people, including a single manager. I’m far and away the longest tenured member of the company, with my manager being relatively new and more of a supply manager than anything. Not her fault.

Right now we have two people- myself and our manager. This is from a series of unfortunate events that are mostly outside of our control (someone getting arrested outside of the state, etc), but the end result is I’m the only person capable of working. And due to the specific nature of my job, it takes around six months for me to train someone to do it competently. We have a single client we supply with a certain material they use in construction supplies.

Recently, said client has increased their production and thus their need for raw materials. The result is that I am faced with a choice: work 12 hours a day, every day, in order to stay afloat until the unforeseen future of getting new people is realized (could be months away); or don’t, and allow our client to run out and thus rely on another supplier, essentially causing our entire business to go under and be shut down, and me lose my job.

I have worked 12-hour shifts every day since October, with no days off. I live an hour away so with my commute my entire life is now this job. My wife is fed up, but I just don’t know what to do.

I don’t blame or resent my manager - half the time she’s in here slaving away with me doing things that aren’t her job. We’re both trying to keep the Titanic afloat because we both know that if we fail, we’re done.

I’m just not sure what to do. The money is good, but this life of an entire company being on my shoulders and the knowledge that a single misstep means I can go from working 84+ a week to 0 is stressful, and that’s ignoring the stress of being a work robot for four months in a row.

When I hear stories of slave conditions I often naively think, “Why don’t they just quit? That’ll show them!”, but here I find myself in an equitable situation and see no way out. I have three children, a wife, and rolling some dice on the hopes of finding something else isn’t something I can entertain. To top it off, I literally don’t have time to search.

Tl;dr - At a small company, I am faced with the choice to either work 84 hours a week or see the company I work for, and thus my job, disappear.",1644146517.0

Sure the ""old timers"" had fantastic healthcare and even a pension. Not even an option for him. That's when I learned about the different tiers.

I take my flight home the next day and upon landing at my final destination, I see a generic rejection letter in my email. At this point I’m shocked, heartbroken and confused- no way, right? 
The next day I call the person I had been in contact with, no response. No response from others on the interview panel, HR said they would look into any feedback- because at this point I just want to know why you wasted 4 days of my life in addition to 4 literal months of interviews and essays. I never receive a response from anyone, they just reposted the job vacancy and moved on.

I am not sure if this will get any traction but I wanted to reach out and ask if people here thought there was feasibility in my idea.

Basically my idea is this: Start a company that teaches businesses how to deal with the current generation of workers ( I have completed a lot of the courses out there like Ken Blanchard, Dale Carnegie, etc). The current programs that are out there feel outdated and irrelevant (although Dale Carnegie has some good points) and I think that it could be a win to bring ideas from these communities and wrap them up neatly and present them to higher ups.  Presentations from an outside entity usually carry more weight, and paid presentations have a pilgrimage effect where people want to believe it because they have already  sunk their costs.

&#x200B;

If you have read this far, and don't think i'm some total idiot I will explain how I came to this place: I worked different jobs throughout my teens and 20s (McDicks, bar tending, construction, phone sales (dong pills and wrinkle cream)) then I got a job working for the US government, and worked my way up to middle management over the years.   I am now in a position where I give what amounts to continuous improvement consultations to some pretty heavy hitters, and I swing between feeling like I'm helping the tradesmen level workforce and I'm just wasting oxygen for people the could use it better.  Most of upper management are boomers, and not just in age but in classical boomer attitudes about how boot strapping is the only way, how they are proud of how many of their family milestones they missed to be at work.  The thing is that because I formally was a millennial who ascribed to all that bullshit and earned a professional pedigree to match it I have earned their trust, and about 50% of the people I talk to implement my recommendations and have measured improvement in morale and retention (which also has a direct correlation to lower costs and increased productivity).  This has also put me in a position where I have had people tell me that they won't ""let the inmates run the prison"" and that we're not ""just flipping burgers here"", both of which I have some good justice porn stories about if anyone is interested.

&#x200B;

All this is to come to say this: I think taking what I do to private industry could help people, maybe I haven't been reading the room correctly but even if I couldn't get a lot of traction at the very least I could help bleed overhead and I could communicate things to upper management in a direct and satisfying way. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR I work trying to help an outdated generation of government managers try to unfuck their antiquated ideas and just wanted to see if I'm in an (incredibly supportive) echo chamber of friends and family who support my hopes to take it private or if it actually makes sense.",1644156554.0

I worked as a lifeguard this past summer and I thought I’d share the bullshit I experienced here. To get started, I had to pay for my own training, yes PAY THEM for them to TRAIN ME to work for them. I was dumb at the time and did it anyways $200 for TRAINING ALONE. Apparently despite paying, I could have failed training and not gotten the job… luckily I passed all the tests (respectfully Im going to be a lifeguard I better know how to save lives) but then I was informed I needed to pay for my uniform…. $80 just for the suit alone, not including the required whistle, aid pack, t shirt….. sure Im in this deep enough why not. 
I expected because I live near the equator and that I paid them to start working with them that I’d get paid WELL. No, i got paid $8 an hour in 103°F weather…. In 10 hour shift. TEN HOUR SHIFTS?! It gets worse… I’d work over time often because of my areas local lifeguard shortage, 10 hours a day 70 hours a week….. that should get me overtime pay right?

Before I started my career, I worked a lot of retail and manufacturing jobs. I’ve been a janitor, telemarketer, assembly line grinder, sweater-folder, and McDonalds slave. 

The amount of bullshit I had to deal with where jobs saw me as “disposable” was insane. Being managed by mediocre knockoff-brand Machiavellis. Being dinged for a few minutes late or using the bathroom. Not given any sick days, so I had to choose between a cut in my check or spreading illness. Being punished for not participating in the store bro culture. You all know all the bullshit. I didn’t understand why I’d be fucked with over burgers or phone surveys. 

Now, I work for a place where what I do as an individual is far more risky and costly, yet I can basically dick around so long as the work is done. I spend probably an hour or two daily on the internet. No one is monitoring my computer activity or MS Teams status. I send stupid memes on Slack to coworkers. I do laundry during large meetings now that we’re work from home. Doctor appointment? No note needed. Coworkers all do the same. I’m managing huge sums of money, yet I’m given an exponentially greater amount of freedom to do whatever with my work time.

I work in construction and have done so for about 10 years. I was a laborer for the first 7 of these 10 years and in the last 3 I really made an effort to live up and make this into my career since it’s what I live to do.
      

I worked for a residential home builder after my dad who is the general superintendent and “right hand man” of my ex boss got me the job there. About 4 months ago I decided to take a shot at getting my own contractors license with encouragement from my boss and dad. I did and got it taking the first step to what would eventually be me owning my own business.
      
I worked my ass off in those 3 years to go from laborer to project manager of his new home builds. It was an 8 man crew plus whatever subcontractors worked with us. I’m in my late twenties and everyone else is at least 15 years older than me. Up until last year everything we did was under the table or 1099. Most of us were either minorities, immigrants and a few illegal immigrants. The pay was slightly above average for the labor in the area with me earning less than everyone else.
         
However I noticed as I grew and my responsibilities grew and he would give me a raise, he would also raise everyone else automatically. Even though everyone else had English as a second language and didn’t go to school past the 8th grade(in their home countries). The only educated ones were my boss with some college, me with some college, and my dad who graduated from a technical school in Mexico.
          
Anyways since I wasn’t earning low and I felt that because I was young and inexperienced I was still learning how to be an actual professional, I never asked for more money or why I was earning less. In hindsight it was my own fault for feeling like I was worth less cause of my inexperience in the workforce.
        
After acquiring my license my boss would say that any small job that came his way he would send it to me to dip my feet into the business side. Fast forward to 4 weeks ago a person walking on the streets walks up to the house we’re working on. It’s just me my dad and another worker. My boss isn’t around so when the person asks for him I direct them to his number on the sign in the front. He asks me if I do work on the side. I told them I was licensed and have him my info, putting a heavy emphasis that I only do small jobs and to clear it with my boss. I told them since I was on his jobsite that they would have to call him first and see if they can work with him and if not come to me.
    
An hour later he comes to the jobsite and the first thing I tell him is what had happened with the person. I also told him that if they called me first I would not take any job unless approved by him.
         
He then proceeded to get insanely pissed off and berating me. I apologized immediately and told him it would never happen again and that I was out of line. He cooled off and I considered the matter resolved when Sunday morning I get a text from him saying I wasn’t working the following week.
     
The same thing happened the next week and the week after. By the fourth week I message him back telling him that if I was being fired to let me know directly so I could look elsewhere. 2 days after that he messaged me saying “I’m ready for you to come back to work. My feelings were hurt over what you did but I’m willing to look past it, see you tomorrow”
              
I was livid and never replied back now looking for another job and doing my own side work. According to my dad he’s scrambling between job sites since no one else can read the plans or deal with inspections.",1644107010.0

I worked one day on that set for &17/hr and I worked 12 hrs (standard hours for movies. I know, thats messed up) The next two days I was told production was being delayed and after a couple days, I was sent an email to attend a meeting at the production office. There they announced that they were moving the production to Oklahoma due to ""new mexicans being crooks"" and they would be willing to take some crew with them. I was unable to go due to personal reasons.

It's now February and I have still yet to be paid. From what I am hearing, they still haven't paid some who did go with them to Oklahoma as well as some crew that they hired once they went to Oklahoma. It's been 4 months and they are not paying people what they promised.

This production had MILLIONS to shoot and they refuse to pay there crew what is owed. Film productions have a really strong union but this show was not organized as a union show (im sure if it stayed in NM it would have been organized rather quickly) I reached out to numerous members of the production office and some of them have told me that that they have not been paid either and that there is an attorney in NM that is building a case agents the producers of the film. from what I understand from the line producer (who has not been paid either) The plan is to wait to pay people until they finish the movie (witch they will never do with all the legal fees piling up) and then pay them with the profits of the movie. so apparently they are STILL trying to raise money from investors to finish the movie despite its crew not being paid.

I want to state who it was but I guess it's all agents reddits TOS so it's difficult. someone who worked on the show in oklahoma made a long facebook post about it and told me I could share it but it has other peoples info on it to warn people who may end up working with these folks on FB and with some quick research, that will get me in trouble too. That post also has more info on it that I don't have in this post including an alleged $35,000 to the writer/director and the same amount for the writer/producer Both cited as ""writers fees"" again, not confirmed. Apparently they are producing more movies as I type this yet they still have not paid for there first crew. Will update with more info if I get it.

I want it to be a small software solutions firm specialising in automation, optimization, and streamlining of tasks. Now, where this subreddit, this movement comes into play is that i want my business to be fair and to conform to the beliefs of this entire community. If you were to ask me what they are, here are a few, listed in an order of priority, which i feel are important

1) Fair, worth it pay. Ofcourse i too, like a good chunk of y'all fall in the youngsters category, and i too feel like pays are small and low. Ofcourse, it's going to be a new business so things will be tough, but i am grateful to be born in a quite well to do family. I feel like everyone deserves the pay they have worked for. I am thinking of a system where one with a concious and morally sane can choose their own pay, given a fair range. Say i want someone with expertise in Python, specialising in automation, and maybe someone else with react for a website I'd like to build. I believe, please keep in mind i am still not initiated into the market, that ₹180K - 200K seems fair, and i might even offer a range from 180K - 220K

2) An open, friendly workspace. Again, the benefit of me still being young is that i might just end up hiring people from my own age group. Though i might be the boss, what i would love to see is that i dont hold a position of power in many, except the most crucial, decisions. I'd loooooooove to see a system of votes and what the employees would want. This is an idea I've taken from my dad who runs his own thing too. I am not sure, cuz still some traits have been bashed into me since birth, but i would also, maybe, like to see pay discussion. It keeps power in check, and does not allow anyone to go on a power trip.

3) Feedback from you all. I would want to see what's the best thing to do in today's world, which truly appeals to my prospective colleagues, and to me as well, as a business owner. Trust me, I'm happy with a 2% profit margin as long as I return home a happy man with my head above the waters around

I feel as if I were gutted and my insides
thrown to the winds.
I’ve met some good people along the
way and also the
other kind.
yet when I think of all those
I have worked with
even though decades have passed
Karl
comes to mind
first.

I remember Karl: our jobs required we
both wear aprons
tied from behind and around
the neck with string.

I was Karl’s underling.
“we got an easy job,” he
told me.

each day as one by one our superiors arrived
Karl would make a slight bend at the waist,
smile, and with a nod of the head
greet each: “good morning Dr. Stein,”
or, “good morning Mr. Day” or
Mrs. Knight or if the lady was unattached
“good morning, Lilly” or Betty or Fran.

I never
spoke.

Karl seemed concerned at this and
one day he took me aside: “hey,
where the fuck else you going to get a
two hour lunch like we
do?”

“nowhere, I guess …”

“well, o.k., look, for guys like you and me,
this is as good as it can get, this is all
there is.”
I waited.

“so look, it’s hard to suck up to them at first, it
didn’t come easy for me
but after a while I realized that it
didn’t matter.
I just grew a shell.
now I’ve got my shell, got
it?”

I looked at him and sure enough he did look like he had
a shell, there was a mask-like look to his
face and the eyes were null, void and
undisturbed; I was looking at a weathered and
beaten conch.
some weeks went by.
nothing changed: Karl bowed and scraped and smiled
undaunted, perfect in his
role.
that we were perishable, perhaps didn’t occur to
him
or
that greater gods might be
watching.

I did my
work.

then, one day, Karl took me
aside again.

“listen, Dr. Morely spoke to me
about you.”

“yes?”

“he asked me what was wrong with
you.”

“what did you tell
him?”

“I told him that you were
young.”

“thanks.”

upon receiving my next check, I
quit

but

still
had to
eventually settle for another similar
job
and
viewing the
new Karls
I finally forgave them all
but not myself:

being perishable sometimes makes a
man
strange
almost
unemployable

most
obnoxious
no servant of
free
enterprise.

So for the last little while I have been working for a small company me the owner and one other guy doing additions and renovations. He paid me 25 bucks an hour when i started been there for just over a year. Never talk or a raise or a preformance review nothing. All he said to me just before i left for trade school in January is that "" i see you and my other coworker at the same level and i would rather give you the money. (He makes 30) as he had mentioned to me that he has been trying to find another guy to replace said coworker"" 

Now i should say i loved working for this guy. Great work environment and he was really big on work life balance. 8-430 m to f. Never a weekend or stay late and every holiday off. I know extremely lucky. 

While in trade school I got approached by one of the bigger custom home builders in Ontario asking me if I would be interested. At first I said thanks but no thanks but after talking to my wife she said there is no harm in looking at the opportunity. So I go in talk to them and after showing pics of what I have done they gave me an offer I couldnt refuse. 30 an hour for my probationary period then 35 once I achieve my red seal and after my probationary period. Paid benefits, (had no benefits before) still M to F but 730-430 instead of the 8. They also say if i become a site lead. Thats 50 an hour and a truck. 

So I came home clearly blown away. Talk to the wife and we decide I have to take this job that just came out of nowhere. I am feeling super anxious about quitting cause I loved my job my boss is a great guy and I real feel like i am screwing him over cause he cant even find a guy to replace the guy he wants to fire. So i sit on the offer for a week, finially accept it. And now on to the terrible part.

I go to my bosses house first thing Friday morning and try to tell him about this opportunity and the chance for extreme career growth. And he just lost. Like breaking up and with a girl and they just show a terrible you had never seen before. 

He goes your wife makes really good money why do you both need good money. You guys dont have kids anyways.

He says i never thought you were the type of guy to chase money. I thought you wanted to be a real Carpenter. 

Puts the blame on me cause now it is my fault that he has to keep the other guy. 

Basically just made me feel like complete shit for quitting and he showed his true colours. Never once said hey man i glad i was able to make you a better Carpenter to go get a great career opportunity. Just a little disappointed in my boss that he made it all about how i am screwing him over and how dare i look out for myself. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",1644060140.0

I am diagnosed with autism, no one there ever knew. Most of us were married and had to give so much of our personal lives for that company.

My wife had to leave her current workplace due to mistreatment. We were afraid she would be fired at any moment. Easier to have her be the fall-guy than to change their processes and to be accountable. She had a referral at her dream company, but their hiring was in-flux and clearly she couldn't wait around for them to start hiring since she didn't want to be fired and ruin her resume for the next 5 years. She applied for another job and accepted it. A couple weeks later, her dream company finally started hiring. She applied and got an interview and she was offered the job. She accepted it and contacted the other company to apologize that an opportunity that better aligns with her goals came along. Now my father-in-law is lecturing her about how unethical that is and that when you tell someone you're gonna do something that you should do it. Like come on man, is she supposed to stay at her current job and risk being fired? She only accepted the first job offer in the first place because staying at her current employer was risky. Is she now obligated to stay at this company just because she accepted the job offer? HELL NO! We're not slaves. ""You signed a contract"" he says as if you can sign yourself into slavery. Yeah, she signed a contract that says she can leave at anytime for any reason. The only unethical thing here is what her previous employer did to her and that her dad is giving her unsolicited bad advice and making her feel like she's done a bad thing. It's easy to say that you wouldn't take the second job offer when it's not you dealing with this nonsense. To me, it might have been SLIGHTLY (still not really) unethical if she had already interviewed for both and was just waiting for responses, but that's just not the situation.

To be fair, this man has been abused in the workplace his whole life and took it like a bitch. He is miserable at his current job. It pays well, but he had to be abused by shitty management for 30 years to get where he's at and he sleeps like 2 hours a night because of the anxiety he gets from work. The work-life balance is hot garbage. I always tell him that I work to live while he lives to work. I will speak up when things aren't going well and I need to live my life. I will leave in an instant if an employer doesn't give me opportunities to grow and have a healthy work-life balance (okay, probs not immediately, I would line another job up first). But it's always me that's wrong and doing the unethical thing. For example, when I left my job after a year to switch to a company that respected me, I made an unethical choice because you just NEED to stay there at least 2 years. /s I would argue that it's unethical to take it like a bitch instead of speaking up so that things change for your posterity. Personally, I think he might be projecting and getting defensive because it hurts him to realize that he took all that abuse for nothing and that he could've been setting boundaries for himself this whole time. Luckily, he is going to leave his job. He's finally had enough after 30 years of bad management and sleepless nights. Not right now though! But within the next 6 months, because taking it like a bitch while he prepares his abusers for his departure is the ethical thing to do! /s

Quick tangent:

Sometimes he is involved in hiring at his current company, and quite frankly, he needs to realize that Gen Z'ers simply do not have the same attitude towards working. It doesn't mean that our values are unethical. He mentioned that they have trouble bringing on young people (go figure). He might disagree with our attitude, but it's not gonna change and if he wants to hire us, he needs to get over himself. Luckily, I think he will get a reality check when he finally leaves his current job in 6 months. It will be his first time on the job market in 30 years. I can't wait for him to end up in the same situation as my wife to see how he justifies choosing the job that's better for him when they don't get back to him till 2 weeks after he already settled for another job that he really doesn't give a shit about. I can see it now. ""Gotta pay the bills"" he says. Sorry dude, no takebacks! /s",1644044255.0

I don't post often(if at all) and I'm on mobile so I'm sorry about formatting. Been a lurker for a while but only now really have sometime to post about.

*Backstory*

I've been searching for a job for about 5 months now and have had countless interviews that all either end in A) Rejection or B) straight up being ghosted by the company. So as one could imagine at this point I'm pretty down and desperate for anything that looks like I could build a future out of it.

*Present*

As the titles says, I applied for a position with a local company...The position was a delivery driver at $16hr plus tips with company car to use for delivery, 401k options, career advancement plans, health, all the good stuff.

Now comes the title of my post/my reason for posting...

I got the job offer woohoo!! Except they are offering me $12 an hour instead of the $16 that was stated in the listing. I rechecked the job listing and they changed the amount that was originally stated at the top, however they did not change the overall compensation that is listed at the bottom. I know it's something small to get hung up on but still, it's unethical and I don't appreciate being switched like that(who would?). 

I haven't accepted the offer yet, and am planning on sending an email to HR to confirm details and get this sorted out. I'm also thinking about contacting the department of labor (Indiana) and get their take on this, if they are even able to that is.


I guess this is where I'm at right now.

On one hand I need a job, for my sanity, confidence, and to get me out of the house. It'll at least be a foot in the door for the company and could hopefully become something more...

On the other hand if they are already doing something unethical as this what's to stop them in the future for more shady practices? Are they really serious about the career advancement or is that just something they're saying so I'll get sucked in and then not be able to move up.

Perhaps this is just my ego getting to me, after all this time I should be glad I've gotten an offer and can actually start doing something. 

Anywho thanks for reading, hopefully y'all will have some insight and/or be able to put things into perspective for me.

**TLDR**
Job listing stated $16/hr, but offer was for $12/hr. I checked the job listing and the company changed the amount in the listing($12) from what was previously listed($16). Is there anyway to get what was in the original listing? Maybe a negotiation tactic for that original hourly rate? Or just suck it up and be grateful I have an offer at all?",1644030540.0

In one case, a senior manager was hired after the municipal manager told HR ""this guy gets an interview"" after a round of golf as a favour to a buddy, and surprise surprise, he gets hired. That senior manager for two years has harassed and bullied his staff to the point that retention is a huge issue with lots of people leaving, and he was chased out of his last two jobs for the same thing but here it's all tolerated and swept under the rug. The fellow just doesn't understand that shouting, swearing, threatening and throwing things isn't a ""valid leadership style"". 

The last three years has been a constant parade of good, hard working, ethical people leaving the organization because they realized that things were not going to change. This has been ignored by the senior leadership, and has created a system with a selection biase: good people who are moral and intrinsically know what ""is right"" leave, and the crap people stay to empire build and protect their own butts.

After four years of increasingly having the senior leadership and management team turn against me as  a""shit disturber"", even though I was just trying to do right by everyone and make sure we didn't  have any bad incidents and were generally moving in a positive direction safey wise, due to the stress of having to compromise my morals and ethics on an almost daily basis, I developed a form of arthritis due to the stress. I went from being pretty healthy to having to walk with a cane most days. 

My new manager? I have the feeling she heavily misrepresented herself in the interview process. She's completely borked union negotiations (4 months and counting, normally a 2-3 day process). She is 100% ""for the employer"" but claims to be ""striking a balance between workers and management"". I lost track of the number of times she directed me to break OH&S or workers comp laws. On top of it, completely vacuous and unable to comprehend the most basic of information. We were into late January and still without objectives for the year, because she felt the spreadsheet we had been using for half a decade just fine to track projects was ""too confusing"". I made a slide deck to give to senior leadership concerning safety stats, and I had to explain to her the concept of what an X and Y axis in a bar graph are......

Anyway, I went on winter vacation in Christmas, and within days was magically all better health wise, and that's when I decided that staying with my employer constituted a hazard to my health. I threw out a few resumes and quickly found a new job where (after my first week) I am valued, my input is welcome, and no one is asking me to not report injuries to worker's comp, or ""i forbid you to discuss their rights with xxxx"". My new manager is stellar and is 100% a professional compared to my last manager.

I am proud to say I am part of the movement. Remember, if your employer is mistreating you, there is probably an opportunity waiting out there for you to trade up or at the very least, make a lateral transition out of a bad situation. 

I will be posting regularly here stories of the incompetence, abuse and weak ethics of senior leadership at my old job. This is therapy for me to get those demons out and not have to carry them anymore.",1644030655.0

Needing the shitty paycheck from your shitty job is why employers continue to treat employees like shit.

YOU have to change that power dynamic if you want to better your situation. Quiting today isn't always an option, but working towards being able to quit tomorrow is.

This is how workers can hit employers back and force change.  The more options YOU have the less they have.

Even if just an hour a day, learn something that makes you more marketable, choose a path and then travel it.

Put money aside, 5 or 10% a month (I know, not everyone can, but if you can, do it).  Try to get in a position where you can go a few months without a paycheck.

Small steps up are fine.  Your next job doesn't have to be your dream job, as long as its better than your current its worth it for now, and continue working towards better.

Bottom line;  no company is going to make your kife better for you, you have to do it yourself.   Force the change.",1644027060.0

I feel like many of the work reform demands or requests are pretty reasonable for a society.

I make a pretty good salary, it's more than I actually need. How can I use my extra money to help out others here.

It was going ""fine"" so long as you could deal with the CEO being a condecending prick but I needed the money because I was now a father. My son was born during the summer and I took off 2 weeks of parternity leave using our generous ""unlimited PTO"", which I knew was a trap but I hadn't puzzled out how yet.

Come back from leave, work like normal, miserable because of being called dumb and lazy because I can't figure out two totally alien technologies and make them dance a jig in two weeks. Things roll around to annual review time. It's been plainly obvious to my family how miserable I am and the lack of sleep from a young kid isn't helping.

I go in to the meeting and get slapped with ""Why should we pay you any more since you are clearly unhappy here?"".  
Well...ok...that's one way to start a review I supposed.   
There is some discussion on my billable hours, which was something I'd been doing on some projects that year, but not all. Turns out there is a quota I need to meet that wasn't spelled out in my offer letter anywhere, and I've missed it by about 2 weeks. The amount of time I was on paternity leave.   
Me: ""Ah, I see what happened. The gap is from when I was on leave with my newborn.""   
CEO: ""Well, family is the most important. **And we're a family here**""

I'm not getting a raise. I'm being criticized for being insulted by...being insulted repeatedly over the last year for my lack of skill when I'm really just a software tester trying to learn new skills on the job. I'm getting told in a round-about way that I should do more for the job and less for my family.

CEO: ""Do you even want to keep working here?"" in a tone that sounds an awful lot like wanting me to beg for the job.  
Me: ""...No. I don't. I'm going to go back to school. I'll finish out the year then I'm done"".  
CEO: ""Oh. Okay then. We'll put the paperwork together.""

My wife is secretely extactic because she knows I've been hating my life. My folks are visiting and had told me in plain words that morning to not quit until I had something lined up, which I hadn't managed despite trying the last few months.
I sell every investment I have and fast track a second mortgage on my home and I'm enrolled in a software bootcamp 3 weeks later. After a lot of work, a few COVID/Stress related breakdowns, and 8mo I land my current job. Better pay, better hours, no ""family"" talk, and a supportive atmosphere.

After I left I found out the old CEO had screwed my brother over on the job, effectively stealing a large amount of wages and IP, and until that company gets valuable enough no lawyer will take on the case because it's not worth the money.

I wish there was some grand justice where they failed but so far that hasn't happened.    
I also wish more people had the ability/resources to do what I did. 
I can just take some satisfaction in the suprise on that Jackasses face that I wouldn't grovel for the opportunity to be abused.",1644020428.0

Let me provide some recent examples:

- She’s been on mandatory OT since November and has had to work 6 day weeks since and has only had 2 weeks where she had a full weekend off.

- I’ve been severely ill to where I’m on disability at the moment and I can’t always drive myself places (specifically doctors appointments). I am seeing a specialist in two weeks (Valentines day) and she tried to get the day off to drive me and they told her no, other people requested it off first so tough shit and maybe not to request time off “at the last minute”.

- We will have to put our family dog down next Friday and got it scheduled with the vet. Guess whose job won’t allow her to take it off? Yep!

I’m so sick of this and I know she is too. Oh and calling in sick or family emergencies? Can result in a write up- which will interfere with one’s ability to get promoted or transferred to another department! Fuck capitalism and fuck places that don’t provide a healthy work life balance. 

Before anyone suggests her quitting… it is not viable nor realistic for us. We live in a high cost of living state and we needed both our incomes together to pay for everything. As stated above, I’ve been ill and on disability from my job and have been since December, with no end in sight on when I’ll recover. I don’t get the money I did when I was working, and we’re already living off savings a little bit. She can’t afford a write up either because she’s been put on a wait list and is next up to transfer to another department and it won’t go through if she gets written up for calling off! Ridiculous they can hold this over peoples heads.

Edit: you guys are acting like applying for other jobs is easy. In this case, It’s not that simple my guys and allow me to explain. This is the only company in our immediate area that specialize in the field she’s trying to get in- which is the department she’s waiting to move over to. And let’s not forget our shitty healthcare system and how all our much needed insurances are tied to these jobs- we can’t wait 3 months minimum to get her on something else. Please refrain from suggesting finding another job, it’s not helpful in our situation at this current time where I’m out of work and neither are we in a position where we can simply move out of our current living space. Legit, her changing jobs would be more expenses due to from driving 5 minutes to work, to over 2 hours to another job in our nearest city. And as stated above, we’re not pulling in the money we used to since I’ve been ill. Appreciate the advice, but it’s not viable at this time.",1644018608.0

skrzh7,Being expected to be productive 24/7 is a recipe for terrible mental health,29,0.86,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/skrzh7/being_expected_to_be_productive_247_is_a_recipe/,1,"The modern world of work has evolved into a kind of arms race, where people are expected to be constantly productive, more and more optimised, more closely observed. We have internalised this and put ourselves on the clock 24 / 7 - we can’t relax on a day off because we feel like we’re supposed to be doing something. I’ve heard from many people when they’re not feeling well that they feel guilty about not working - I experience this as well. I recovered from covid recently and beat myself up for not being productive enough in work.

This culture is starting to change though. There’s been a shift recently in the balance of power between employers and workers. It’s great that awareness is rising, poor behaviour from leaders is being challenged and that protecting people’s wellbeing at work is becoming an important issue. But it really shouldn’t take millions of people quitting for leaders to wake up and put the mental health of employees at the top of their priority list and there's some very simple things that can be done to change the culture.

Step one is to listen. Work is a much happier place if leaders listen to what employees have to say without judgement, without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing. Its easy to get defensive when people are complaining but that creates an 'us and them' environment. Having a forum where people feel free to express themselves without being shouted down, where their concerns are taken seriously and (where appropriate) acted on goes a lot of the way to addressing discontent. More than anything, people just want to feel listened to and understood.

Step two: letting go. Quit spinning the wheels for a while and figure out what is really important. If that's too big a question, ask - what makes something an important task. Then apply those criteria to the to-do list and do the most important stuff in the time available. Whatever falls off the end of the list, let it go. Poor leadership expects everything to be done. That is not reasonable and is incredibly stress inducing.

And step three is valuing people’s feelings. Many workplaces have a macho culture where you push on through, you get the job done regardless of the cost. If people get bullied, harassed and shouted at, that's just collateral damage - you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette. No-one wants to work in an environment where their sadness and anxiety are just part of the process. Consciously make wellbeing and mental health part of the decision making process for how work gets done, not just something that's added to a corporate document.

And we can do these for ourselves at home as well. Value your peace, your mental health. Make it the most important factor in your decision making. Carve out time for rest and recovery, prioritise tasks in your doing time and don’t put pressure on yourself to do everything. And of course - stop and listen to your feelings, even your difficult feelings. Give yourself an internal forum where it’s OK to think what you’re thinking and OK to feel what you’re feeling. Doing these simple things does wonders for your mental health.

My bi-monthly pay of about $2,333 becomes about $1428 once you subtract for taxes, insurance, 401k, etc. 

My monthly rent is $1550. Electric is about $200; water is another $100. Phone service and top-of-the-line internet to support my endless Zoom meetings, that's about $400 combined there. 

I live in a standard American city with no public transportation system. So we add $250 for my car payment another $150 for my insurance.

Current take-home? $2856 

I have a whopping $206 leftover.

skqpnq,"City of Ontario spent over $133,000 trying to fire an employee for allegedly shoplifting a protein bar, even though she was neither charged nor convicted.",23,0.9,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/skqpnq/city_of_ontario_spent_over_133000_trying_to_fire/,3,"The City of Ontario was certain that police records specialist Gricelda Perez had pilfered a $2.99 protein bar from a convenience store in 2018, and officials set out to fire her.Perez said she was never arrested or charged with a crime.

But Perez denied ever taking the RXBar. A search of her car and purse turned up the wrapper from the string cheese she had purchased, as well as the receipt, but no protein bar or wrapper. A grainy video of the alleged theft, which received Zapruder-like scrutiny, was judged “inconclusive,” even by the expert paid by the city to examine it. And an independent arbitrator, after a three-day hearing, found that there was no cause to fire Perez and ordered the city to reinstate her with back pay.

“It was three very long, stressful years, but I can’t even begin to tell you what it feels like to finally get justice,” Perez, 30, said in an interview on Thursday, Jan. 6. “There were many times I wanted to give up, but if it wasn’t for my support system, my family, my friends, my union, my gosh, we wouldn’t be here without them.”

The city of Ontario spent almost $134,000 in legal fees in its failed attempt to fire a civilian police records specialist who officials accused of stealing a $2.99 energy bar from a convenience store in 2018, according to records obtained by the Southern California News Group.

Perez visited the AM/PM store near the police station on June 19, 2018. As she shopped, Perez said in the interview, she picked up the bar, read its nutritional information and put it back. The video showed Perez bringing her hand back near a pocket, Judge David Cohn wrote. Perez paid for the cheese and coffee and left.

The manager, identified in the ruling as Tracy Ellington-Davis, watched this unfold on the store’s surveillance video and believed that Perez had pocketed the protein bar. But Ellington-Davis did not confront Perez, who was wearing her civilian police uniform, and instead later drove to the police station to report the incident.

The manager of the AM/PM market was adamant that a surveillance video showed 30-year-old Gricelda Perez slipping the RXBar into her pocket, and a police detective who watched the video backed up that assertion. But the first officer who investigated the case and a video expert who examined the film frame-by-frame said the images were inconclusive.

Yet even after an independent arbitrator found that there was no cause to fire Perez and ordered the city to reinstate her with back pay, the City Council, after listening to testimony in a three-day hearing in 2020, voted in a closed session in 2020 to uphold Perez’s dismissal.

“What was done should never have occurred,” said Romualdo Sanchez, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 1932, which represented Perez and documented her situation in a video. “It’s truly unbelievable that the city would commit a vast amount of resources to keep this proud mother and hard-working public employee away from her job.”

On Saturday 1/15 I came down COVID. I did the responsible thing, got tested and notified my supervisor. She was kind, let me know she hoped I would be okay and that I would need a negative test after 5 days to return to work.

By Thursday 1/20 I was feeling much better, and scheduled a test as soon as could find one, on Monday 1/24. Returned positive. Notified supervisor and she told me again that I would need a negative result and that the home tests were not accepted. So I tested again on Wednesday, still positive. On Saturday I was able to get an ID NOW rapid test done and finally tested negative. Was told I could return to work on Monday 1/31.

Now we do have sick leave but due to chronic health issues I didn't have much available. Certainly not a full 2 weeks, which my supervisor was aware of. I was told straight up that I could not return to work so I assumed that there was a policy in place to provide extra sick leave to those with a positive covid test. Just got paid $400 and asked my supervisor what happened and she said that the covid leave policy didn't go in effect until 1/28(there previously was only a policy in place for detention officers and the like but not general office employees) so I wouldn't qualify for it. Now I am freaking the fuck out. I put in an email to HR, but the offices are closed because of ice until Monday. How the fuck can I be told I CAN'T come to work and then they don't offer any compensation for that time? If I had known I just wouldn't have fucking said anything to them and just returned to work as soon as I was no longer sick.

So I live in the northern US and work in retail. A lot of schools/businesses closed today due to dangerous driving conditions. Its icey on the roads, with a winter weather advisory and it’s supposed to get worse as the night goes on. 

My job is still open because the weather is not considered a “state of emergency.” 

I’m 22 but my car is under my mother’s name and she is not comfortable with driving in this weather, let alone me. 

I called my job to talk to a manager and explain my situation saying that I can’t get into work. Though he was understanding (he is one of my favorite managers) due to company policy, since the store is still open it would be an unexcused absence. 

I just got my time and attendance review where over 6 months I have over 15 “occurrences” (90% of them are literally 2-3 minutes over the late mark yet its still held against me while one was from me needing to get a COVID test before going in). He said I wont get terminated for missing today but that it will still be an occurrence and affect me trying to apply for full time. 

I also asked my manager for a list of all my occurrences and she said she “doesnt have the time to pull them all up”. I received paperwork regarding the occurrences which shows a few examples and says I have 16 others. 

I just wanted to rant because overall this is a load of bullshit, I have to risk both me and my mother’s life to drive into work so I don’t have an occurrence.",1644003176.0

I also want to make it so people can escape that and be an employer too. 

What if we had a tax incentive for small businesses to hire more and large to medium businesses to pay more. It’s a half baked idea but thought I’d see what people think. So let’s say a Business under a yet to be determined size needs people but has an issue with paying minimum wage and competing with the big guys. Well, why not have the business pay say half or less then a minimum wage and the government pays the rest. It’s on a sliding scale so as the company grows it get less and less help for each additional employee. If a company wants to pay someone more the base pay it does not affect the amount paid by the government, so higher value or hard working employees can get raises and the employer can attract good workers over competition. Once a Business starts to grow past that point it goes in the other direction. Big companies need to pay certain amount for base employees like now, however there should be a ratio set between the highest paid employees and the lowest. If that ratio exceeds a certain amount a tax is imposed. Stock options and whatnot are taken into account. The big Business aspect of this I am not sure on. Anyway it’s a thought. Seems something like this would encourage smaller businesses to grow and get started. Seems it would appeal enough to both side of the political spectrum to have a chance anyway.

My transfer brought me to 19$ an hour, transferring to a location with 1/4th the business of my previous location. It was in a really bad area too, basically “the hood”, so the people that worked there were pretty rough around the edges and never last long. 

Their starting pay at that location is 16$ an hour, the “cap out” pay of the successful and profitable location lol only thing that drives pay up is lack of workers. The starting pay at my original location where there is no shortage of idiotic teenagers who want to kiss the corporate penis in hopes of a raise? 11$ an hour

There’s another location in a really “bad area” near Chicago I’m considering transferring to as well, starting pay for lowest tier employee? 22$ an hour, their average employee lasts 2 weeks and they have to pay security guards 24/7 because how bad the area is lol

Don’t ever bust your ass for the false promise of a raise, because it’s 100% the opposite that warrants pay increases

Work just enough to keep your job, and when they give you your raises, THEN you can MAYBE work a little harder lol but don’t work too much harder, because whatever they’re paying you? They can probably afford double the rate

""We could get sued if our donated food makes someone sick! We're just avoiding liability!""

A complete and utter LIE!!

The Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act passed in 1996 and protects restaurants from civil and criminal liability in the case of donated food to a non-profit. 

You think corps don't know this?? They do, they are just hoping YOU don't. 

The other lie:

""A business can only deduct the actual cost of materials donated, so it's just not worth it""

Another huge LIE!!

The IRS greatly incentivizes the donation of excess food inventory, allowing restaurants to write off the FAIR MARKET VALUE of the food they donate. The term is called a ""STRAIGHT COST DEDUCTION"", which means Fair Market Value. In other words, what the item costs on the market to buy. If it costs 1 dollar to buy a donut, a donated donut gets a 1 dollar tax deduction.  However, dishonest corps will say the term COST means THEIR cost, which is a LIE to get you to excuse them for them callously throwing food away. 

Why don't they donate the food then? Because it's easier to just trash it.  They think the tax write-off they get won't be a lot, so they don't care. Granted, writing off a few thousand dollars a year in donations would not net a huge profit,  but they should do it anyway!

They don't take into account the cost of negative public opinion, nor the value of positive public opinion because we have not made it an issue for them. So it's up to us to hold food wasters accountable. Don't patron stores that trash excess food instead of donating it! Let's make them realize that wasting food costs them sales!

Don't believe their excuses, they are lies! Don't let your boss spread these lies, either. Call them out. It is up to you. From this point forward, the one thing you can't say is you were never told the truth.",1643993816.0

They said they would give me a ""trial period"" for my supervisors to see how I operate.

Fast-forward to the next week, and they had trialled me for two 9 to 5 shifts with *no* hint of money coming my way. 16 hours. I was then not contacted for an entire week (which I thought was obviously very odd as I did very well) so I went out of my way to ask them what was happening.

They basically messaged me saying ""Hey, we thought a guy who works in the position you're going for was going to go full-time but now we're not so sure he is. We'll let you know."" And now it's been a week.

Been job searching for a while and I got an offer from a better organization for a better title, and more importantly better pay.

The new place wanted me to start right away, and I was ready to ditch my current employer, so I only gave my current boss a weeks notice. They were totally blown away, telling me how unprofessional I was being and how I was stranding them “high and dry” because a lot of other people have also quit lately. I pointed out my employment agreement was at will and specified that I wasn’t required to give any notice at all, which made them even saltier.

So I kept saying I would ask for more and he should too. Over and over again.

The other tech that sits next to him asked me about it. Now they're both trying to figure out how to negotiate during our review process.

(posted in legal advice too),1,0.57,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sk4hgw/i_suspect_ill_be_wrongfully_terminated_soon_what/,10,"**TLDR:** I'm 25 and have been at my job since mid 2016. I’ve gone from receptionist to admission officer but my pay stub has always said Administrative Secretary. I've remained loyal to this company, got along with everyone and did my job the best I could. I'm scared of simply posting this.

I've witnessed many questionable & crooked practices over the years and that is why I have these suspicions/concerns. Below you can read what triggered everything + additional examples of the things they have done or said.

I've updated my resume and begun actively applying to jobs. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to protect myself without raising suspicions? It's a small office with no HR. My boss (the owner) and superiorA are both extremely paranoid and cautious, nothing questionable is ever put into writing.

**This is a long post, you do not need to read below this unless you want additional details or context. I really would appreciate any advice or tips!**

For disclaimer purposes, everything in this post is \*alleged\*.

**Background:**

Early last week I was called to superiorA's office and the owner was sitting inside. I stood in the doorway and was scolded (from my perspective). His voice was raised (but not screaming or yelling) and was visibly upset. I was very much caught off guard.

It was for something I had **no** involvement in. He was aware of that though because he met with the Registrar prior to calling me in. It was nothing illegal, it was simply the fact that the Registrar had a discussion with an applicant and recommended they join for the May semester instead of the current one which began 3 weeks ago to have a higher chance of success.

After the Registrar assesses an application, I then create the admission package as I’m directed to for her to sign and I email out. In this case, I didn’t even get to the file yet because I had just gotten back from stepping out for 20 mins and was working on my emails.

Anyway, I remained calm, at most the very most I had an annoyed tone. I stated the fact that I was following the direction of my immediate superior (the Registrar). He was upset that I said that. He said that after how long I’ve been here that I should know better than her (she’s been here for 3 years, we share the same knowledge). He said if the Registrar, Dean or anyone tries to tell me otherwise from what I was taught, to ignore them and tell him and he will handle it. Which makes no sense because in any other situation I'd be in trouble for skipping the chain of command. It’s essentially saying I shouldn’t trust the people in those senior positions, which makes no sense because I should be able to and always have in the past. He rambled on, I kind of mentally checked out from shock. I then said I shouldn’t be scolded for something I wasn’t involved in. The conversation seemed to have stopped. I walked away and went back to my desk to continue working.

I was pissed off about it all but went along my business. A few minutes later, superiorA comes to my office saying ""don't be mad"" multiple times. I really was irritated about what just happened but I was calm. I said I'm not happy with how I was spoken to. That it wasn't fair to talk to me like that or scold me for something I wasn't even involved in. I may have mentioned that it's not fair to talk to people like that even if you are the boss or angry, can't remember. After this interaction she goes to his office, she comes back a couple minutes later again telling me not to be mad. Honestly, I would have relaxed and moved on soon enough if she hadn't been stirring the pot. A minute later she goes back to him and almost immediately comes back, saying he wants to see me in the conference room right away.

In point form, paraphrasing (boss often talks in circles) and because I can't remember the order of which everything was said:

\- The only point I tried to convey during the whole meeting was that I did not find it fair to be scolded for something I wasn't involved in. That I have been here for over 5.5 years and I am not known to be overly sensitive or cause a scene, so if something upsets me, it's likely for a valid reason (a statement he made and agreed with prior to this event).

\- Every time I tried to talk, he ignored me and starting browsing his phone, denying what happened and how it made me feel.

\- Said I should be grateful for all he has done for me and that he has tried so hard to keep me here.

\- Reminded me that I am dispensable; but he phrases it as ""we are all dispensable"".

\- Accused ME of accusing HIM of screaming at me. He said superiorA said I told her he screamed at me. She was there, so how? Not once did I say he screamed or yelled, otherwise the whole office would be my witness lol.

\- Said he doesn't like my accusations, asked me if it's necessary for him to start recording our conversations but vehemently denied ever doing so to anyone, but that I make him question whether he should start with me.

\- Flatly denied scolding me or being upset. He said he was simply reminding me of the university policies.

The meeting ended, it was not productive. And that was that.

**Since then:**

My boss and superiorA's interactions with me have been cold & brief. Today I was late due to a snowstorm and confusion on what time the office would be unlocked. Just before I arrived, superiorA sent me an unusually polite email basically saying the amount of time I was late by was not okay and that I am the only one not yet in. (which wasn't even true but ok). I can understand being told not to be late, but receiving an email for it is quite uncommon. Even the Registrar was surprised to hear they did that. It appears they've begun documenting every little thing I do in order to fire me and not be accused of wrongful termination (my boss loathes lawyers).

**Examples of ""alleged"" shadiness:**

\- The receptionist was just let go under the guise of covid & financial constraints. Really, she was just not good at the job and made many mistakes. It wasn't disclosed, but it is believed she may have had some sort of learning disability. I believe she was let go with the above excuse to avoid pointing her mistakes and a possible wrongful termination lawsuit.

\- 1 - 2 staff have sued them for wrongful termination in the last 3 years. I know that one was let go because she began questioning managements practices and rules. They did not like that this person was not submissive and became paranoid of her. I don't remember/know what excuse was used when she was fired.

\- SuperiorA is my bosses right hand and reports all happenings to him. She also lies to him, reports things out of context or purposely changes wording or tone to manipulate situations or people. She has done this to me in the above story and many times prior. Anyone she doesn't like or get along with (see example above) is shortly let go or is pushed to the point of quitting (e.g., using microaggressions, ostracizing, instigating etc.)

\- They do not like anyone who asks questions about or cites their legal rights. Anyone who does is magically let go or quits not long afterwards. When these former employee names come up in conversation, management makes a point of noting how argumentative or combative these people were (even when that's not the case).

\- Positions that aren't ""the face"" of the university (e.g. Receptionist, Admission Officer) are almost always newly immigrated, non-white, vulnerable people. This is done because they are more likely to be submissive, unaware of their rights, can be paid very low and worked to the bone.

\- My black counterpart who does a similar job I do but for our other school, is often excluded from seminars or presentations because she is black. Instructions were made that she should avoid calling applicants (e.g. for interviews, follow-ups) because she has a Nigerian accent. Colleagues with other accents such as Indian or Filipino were not discouraged from making calls to students.

\- Some staff (at least 3) with ethic sounding names were asked or instructed to go by their middle names or nicknames to not sound or appear foreign.

\- Despite being perfectly qualified for the Receptionist or Assistant Registrar position, all non-white candidates were rejected or not pursued. All males were also excluded. My boss believes a man shouldn't be in reception, that he should be in a higher position (and paid more).

\- I was hired as the receptionist because I was young, white, female and well spoken. The receptionist before me was there for a week or so before she was let go and replaced by me, allegedly because she was Latina & had an accent.

**I could really go on, these are just examples from the top of my head but I need to go to sleep soon. I didn't even touch upon the sexism, inappropriate, unprofessional, uncomfortable questions or conversations in the office. OR the favoritism, nepotism and corruption within the school itself lol**",1643949931.0

Recently we started working 9-5 M-Th and it is a game changer. 

The work week was meant to be 4 days. Instead of being anxious about wasting the weekend and going to bed on Sunday with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, I feel recharged and ready to work on Monday. For those of you who work steady jobs: ask your bosses if you can work out a 4 day work week. Show them the several studies that have been done in other countries that prove that efficiency goes UP in a 4 day week. This small change to the average worker’s life brings a MASSIVE quality of life improvement. If we can normalize a 4 day work week then we can begin to push the needle in favor of the worker. Small and simple changes with gather momentum for the larger movement until the evidence is undeniable.

Edit: please note that my appeal here is mostly emotional. I’m not proposing that there is any proven scientific metric that says we are meant to work 4 days but I also think you’d be hard pressed to find a metric that solidifies 5 days as the optimal human work week.",1643948153.0

The job is not a full research assistant package but a part-time one, but I am a university employee (without most of the meaningful benefits of course).

1. editing and formatting the manuscripts so they follow each journal/publisher's style guidelines and other requirements (some of the style guides are dozens of pages long and you have to follow each of them meticulously);
2. locating, managing, and formatting all the bibliography and in-text citations;
3. making sure the graphs and tables meet the publishing requirements (but sometimes it's hard to juts ""edit"" them and you have to redo them completely).

Now, if these are all that is required for this position, then an undergrad with some training might be able to do it. However, papers in our discipline often use a special type of table/diagram that requires special formatting and you just can't do it right without knowing exactly what the researchers are doing, which means at least a couple of years of PhD training is required. And I've seen how their previous undergrad assistant did and it was a disaster. I also regularly spot errors in their data and missing sentences or paragraphs and you can't do that without being able to following the logic of the research and the writing. That's why they decided to only advertise the position to PhD students. So even though the job technically doesn't have a degree/training requirement, it needs PhD students.

But there's more and I didn't know it until I started working with them: it's basically the nightmare scenario for manuscript editing. The professor and all of their co-authors are elderly and (semi)retired, and are terrible at technology. And by technology I mean Word... They essentially treat Word as a glorified typewriter and they often just dump walls of text on me... Also, half of the authors are from other countries and have their own writing styles and habits and I'll have to reformat them all. Version control is almost non-existent. They don't use Dropbox or Google Drive or anything like that. There are often multiple authors working simultaneously on the same manuscript on their own and contradictory/confusing edits are common (and their way of editing is often just adding what they want to write after the original text and mark them cyan or other eye-bleeding color). Of course it's up to me to track down all the different versions and edits from dozens of documents and emails. Don't even get me started on bibliography. I'm pretty sure it causes brain damage. It's partly what prompted me to write this post. I'm genuinely curious how they managed to have so many publications while working like this.

Anyway, it's pretty safe to say that they won't be able to get any of their manuscripts ready to publish without my work. And all the authors have repeatedly complimented the quality of my work and commented that they couldn't have done it without me. And yet, one of the most accomplished scholars in their sub-field at one of the most prestigious universities in the world pays PhD assistants $11-14 per hour. This was the number in the original job post in 2020 and the actual rate ended up being just above $12, which was the minimum wage of our state at that time. Recently the rate went up to $15, a whole $1 above the legal minimum. How generous!

**So why did I take a job that grossly underpays me?** Simple. Because I'm a poor graduate student who was about to run out of funding. A fuller answer will also include the fact that our student workers are not unionized and have essentially no bargaining power, which I will discuss later.

**A better question is, why does the job pay so little?** The professor actually had no say in my wage and is probably not even aware of the actual number. The hiring went through the department, which went through the school/college, which went through the university, and that is just how much the university pays for this type of job.

Now, **the real question is, why does a private university with a tuition that is higher than the median U.S. household income and an endowment higher than the GDP of at least 30% of the countries get to pay its PhD student workers only minimum wage while touting their commitment to the generation and dissemination of knowledge?**

One of the main factors is **the absence of a student union**. Without unionization and collective bargaining, graduate students have little to no bargaining power against professors (who have immense control over students' education and future career) and the school administration. There will always be students poor/desperate enough to do the job regardless of pay and that is how the university is able to keep exploiting them.

There was actually a union push and vote sometime ago in our university, but it failed. Part of the reason was the administrations's union busting tactics (they were more subtle and ""civil"" than how corporations do it, but the idea is the same). And part of it was the lack of experience of the union organizers. Can't blame them too much though, since there were very few successful examples to learn from and most students these days grew up without any exposure to unions and union culture. A piece of unsolicited advice for anyone who's considering/organizing a union push at their school: don't ignore international students if there are a lot at your school, and don't take their support for granted just because they come from ""socialist"" countries. For example, in our union vote, students from countries like China overwhelmingly voted no because most of them were taught to respect authority and avoid anything remotely ""political"" that can potentially ""get them in trouble"". And the union organizers largely failed to recognize and address this concern and communicate to them the role and benefit of the union. Since international students account for a significant portion of the graduate student body, this doomed the unionization effort.

It's just extremely ironic that in our classes we literally teach students that one of the reasons that income inequality has skyrocketed since the 1980s is the stagnation of inflation-adjusted wages for roughly the bottom half of the economy, and that one of the main causes of the stagnation (or even drop) in wages is the rapid decline (or total collapse in some sectors) of unions. Right now in the U.S., the only unions that still have some teeth are police unions (which are kind of a different animal on their own), teacher's unions, and a few others (usually in the public sector). This is not an accident, but by design: through years of lobbying and careful dismantling of the legal framework that supports unions, and the successful propaganda campaigns and culture wars that stigmatized unions and all but killed the union culture and its public support in the U.S.

But maybe things will finally start to change.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading what turned out to be a long post. If you skipped the bulk of the post, it's ok, just remember this takeaway:

**Unions are a healthy and essential part of the economy and the society. Low wage is just the symptom of bigger problems. Try not to just focus on the actual number of wages, but focus more on power: bargaining power and political power. There is power in numbers, and there is power in unity. Profit-seeking corporations will always seek to maximize profit even at the cost of workers. Workers can't depend on their goodwill or mercy. Unionization is one of the best tools workers have and the other is their vote. We have the numbers; we always do and always will. It's all about how much we're united and organized.**

I grew up amongst the proletariat in a nice European country. We never had much, but we were fine. My single mother raising me jumped between jobs, most often planted on her knees scrubbing someone else’s floor.

I wanted to get out and after high-school, I did. I moved to the U.S. I had fallen in love and I was hungry for opportunity (which I never felt that I had.) 

Time flies. 

I have had my chance at opportunity in the U.S and, frankly, I’m doing well. I am my own boss and I both have plenty of customers and great people who want to work for me. Things are good.. but I’m not happy about it. 

I’m not happy because I am a part of a society where so many have to struggle. Daily. Where so many are getting so screwed by terrible employers, by crappy politicians and by systems that are set up to abuse them.

Today’s trigger:

I’m out with Covid and was low on groceries. Decided to do a delivery order. 

I ordered ~$200’s worth of groceries from a large grocery store (private). The grocery store has teamed up with the gig-app Shipt to have individual contractors shop your groceries and deliver them, making very little on each order from either company.

Of course, upon completion of said delivery I am encouraged to Tip!!!!!!!!. 

I tipped very good, of course. But I just shake my head at the screen. 

I want the company providing the service to pay their people well enough that they do not have to encourage the customer to pay for the service AND the wage. Especially not when the corporations and their executives celebrate record profits. 

I just don’t think it’s right. 

And then.. I’m stuck inside with Covid when I realize it is a 70+ lady hobbling out of her car with my stupid groceries.

WHY is Grandma hustling at 6pm? Why is she chasing gigs? 

Sure, there’s the odd chance that she enjoys it and it gives her purpose.

BUT - if she’s out hustling at 6pm because she has to, well… then I’m just not sure that I want to be a part of that society.

AND what if I didn’t tip her? The grocery store or the Gig App would have completely stolen her time, gas money and vehicle wear and traded it for a happy meal. Why is that okay in 2022???

I don’t know what to do. I try to do the right thing. I want the best for my people and for all the people, but so many only want their own coffers to be bigger and bigger. 

And to what point and to what end? Who wants to live in a world and a society like that? 

My nice European homeland does not have grass that is all that much greener. Sure, the grass is different. But it’s not greener. My mother is now close to 70 and hustling night-shifts at a homeless shelter because her sick-pension from working like she did all her life doesn’t cover her rent.

Even if a coworker refers you to an open position and gets you an interview with the manager the job is through a contracting company who is going to try to get as large a cut as possible.

It seems most companies base pay on ‘cost of labor’ or ‘cost of work’ for hiring purposes, but past hiring it is based on a range they give for each type of job, and then give you an incentive increase that fits in the range. 

Inflation I was told is a government issue and no company can take inflation into consideration when giving pay increases, unless inflation causes the cost of labor to go up. 

So if you don’t have a government that cares about dealing with inflation or ensuring people can have housing, food security, and education, you are ultimately screwed.

I use Money to buy Things"" the problem with Capitalism is that it allowed Wealth to be interchangeable with Power and Power Corrupts. Then we allowed Wealth to be unlimited, like if the Human and Natural resources of this Planet were unlimited.... And thus, we can objectively state that *""If Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely, Absolute Money will effectively Corrupt Absolutely too""*.

Politicians themselves say all the time how its so important to limit and distribute political power and political representation in the political power-structure, right? So explain to me why the fuck people who were born rich, are allowed to become so rich they can pay politicians to play them as puppets? Why would anyone think that is controversial to LIMIT WEALTH, when WEALTH=POWER. 

This is literal insanity for me and I can already see Humanity jumping off the cliff like lemmings and not even noticing because they were too busy tweeting something, or taking an instagram selfie, or sharing pseudoscience in facebook, or ranting like a tin foil hermit on Reddit.


I dont need to prove the power they have, or how 9 out of 10 filthy-rich were born millionaires, google the background of any of them. Look at their exploitative tendencies, the pseudo-slave labor they employ. How they say ""Anyone can be a Billionaire"" when their daddies were multi millionaires, and their grandpas were millionaires and they gran-grandpas owned slaves. 

In USA the Sillicon Valley millionaires are lobbying to buy a piece of the Constitution, that will say ""These people have so much money they can build their own cities and make their own laws"". Thats is Feudalism, and if you dont want a Blade Runner future open a tab and google about it. 

And we now arrive in the Era of Fake Value. Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, who knows whats gonna be next, probably Metaverse Personalities, I mean Skins. All Products that dont exist. A string of code being played by a device you carry in your pocket. ""Speculative Economy"" the act of making money out of nothing, out of the works of others you dont even know, out of pixels, a system created and maintained for some few that make more money a month than any of us will ever have in our lifetimes. 

Dont you see? The Cage is descending upon us. Once worth no longer can be experienced in real life, and I mean about ALL worth, from a product or piece of media, to Human worth itself, once all worth is digitalized, real life will be frowned upon. 

But what these people cant grasp, is the fact this Cage will caught most of us in between inside and outside of it, it will cut us in half. I can feel how my mind warps in and out what I experience everyday and what I *read and watch* everyday. 

One day I will disappear, this account will no longer exists, and there will be just some 0 and 1 blowing in the infinite NET that will maybe keep some of these words alive. Because if I dont reject Humanity and go back to Monke, the Suits will enslave me.

The manger pointed out when I got there this was a full time job where working 40+ hours is common and there would be times when I'm working late and times when I'm working early. I pointed out that I had no need to do 40+ hours but with the experience I could bring that taking me on part time would be a good thing for them.

Perhaps working people could mobilize to gain control of the boards of agribusinesses, drug makers and or distributors. I know the super rich have been privatizing left and right and the door is closing.

sjpfhh,Anti-worker organization: National Right to Work Foundation,62,0.96,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sjpfhh/antiworker_organization_national_right_to_work/,5,"In January, nurses at St. Vincent in Worcester, Mass, finally ratified a contract after striking for almost 10 months - after Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh stepped in to mediate.  This contract, among other things guaranteed safe staffing ratios (no more than 4 patients per nurse)

However, one of the scab nurses (among many who has been hired on by the hospital) brought in by the hospital has filed a Petition to decertify the nurses union, and the petition has apparently received enough signatures that a vote will be required.  In addition to decertification of the union (Massachusetts Nurses Association - MNA) at St. Vincent, this petition would void the recently ratified contract, removing the requirement for safe staffing ratios and making all nurses at-will employees.  Ironically, the nurse who started the petition claimed to want ""different representation"" and claimed that the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union (AFSCME) would take over as the representing union, though when reached for comment, the AFSCME denied that they had offered any support for a decertification effort.

St. Vincent is owned by **Tenet Healthcare (**[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_Healthcare)**)**, which: 

* received over $1,000,000,000 in COVID relief subsidies form the federal government
* has had its stock price rise from $11.89 (April 2020) to $75.29 (Feb 3, 2022)
* has reported net income of over $1,079,000,000 over the last 4 reported quarters (Dec 2020-Sep 2021)

Tenet and St. Vincent are forbidden by law from supporting a decertification effort.  Interestingly (and perhaps unsurprisingly), the **National Right to Work Foundation (**[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Right_to_Work_Legal_Defense_Foundation)**)**, has stepped up to support the decertification effort, and has no obligation to disclose its funding.  This organization has been involved in many legal cases seeking to reduce worker power, including [Janus v. AFSCME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_v._AFSCME).  Now that a decertification vote is scheduled, the hospital appears to be using underhanded tactics to prevent many of the striking nurses from returning to work so that the decertification vote will be skewed in the hospital's favor.

**Analysis**

This case is likely indicative of future tactics that will be used by large corporations to fight unions:

* Scab labor will be brought in on a permanent basis
* Striking laborers who return to work after a contract is signed will be driven out through whatever means necessary.
* Scab labor will claim to want better or different representation as an excuse to hold a decertification vote, and the decertification effort will be supported by national organizations dedicated to reducing worker power.

*Future organizers should be prepared for such tactics*.  Union contracts should be negotiated to foreclose corporations' ability to engage in such tactics, and unions should be prepared to deal with ""Judas goat"" employees, including looking for prohibited links between workers and companies who are not permitted to engage in union busting tactics.  Further, unions should make sure that it is abundantly clear that they support the growth other unions and will not participate in or otherwise support decertification efforts.

sjokum,"Those with middle class wealth, help your fellow worker and become a landlord",0,0.33,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sjokum/those_with_middle_class_wealth_help_your_fellow/,71,"There isn't a whole lot we can do to help our fellow worker without political help. However, the housing market is a great place to make some action though.

Become a landlord, and offer your tenant fair terms. If you buy a home for $100k, a 30 year mortgage would leave your payments around $500 a month for principal, interest, and property taxes. 

As a landlord, you will receive tax benefits of being able to expense the mortgage interest, which will be a large percentage of your monthly payment at the start of a loan. Additionally, you can use another tax benefit to depreciate your purchase price of this home over a 30-year term. Meaning, you lower your purchase price by 1/30th of its original purchase price every year. The idea here is that when you eventually sell the house, even if it sold for exactly what you bought it for, you depreciated your purchase price so now you are technically making a profit. Buy a home for 100k, depreciate it to $0 over 30 years and sell it for 100k, you now pay a capital gains tax on the 100k you sold it for. Of course there are loopholes to avoid paying that, but welcome to the American tax system.

The market rent value for a 100k home is around $1000/mo depending on where you live. This is where the greediness of landlords comes into play. That landlord will have the renter paying their monthly mortgage payment plus an additional $500 every month. That money is supposed to be used for property maintenance, but the slumlords of the world often ignore that and allow the home to fall into disrepair. Be a good landlord and keep the home meticulously maintained.

Lastly, your renters could theoretically pay you $1000/mo for 30 years and have no equity in the property they've lived in all while you have received a profit and have a $100k+ asset when it is all said and done. I would suggest that if you are renting your property at market rent value, you should be providing your tenant with equity in the property for continuing to rent the property. I could be convinced otherwise, but I'd like to see landlords offer 1/30th of the appraised home value at initial lease signing every year. Should they decide to leave that property, they receive that amount as a lump sum. To reward tenant loyalty, you could have this equity only begin to accrue after 1 year of renting.

So stretching that all out to a 30 year term, here are the final numbers:

\- You, a kindly landlord, buys a home for 100k and rents it out at $1k/month. You are able to expense items to this property, lowering your taxable income but still receive a yearly profit on the home less any maintenance costs. When you decide to sell the home, you have (hopefully) an asset worth $100k+

\- Me, a worker, rents a home for $1000/mo and am super thrilled when my landlord is nice and actually keeps the property maintained. I stay at this home for 20 years, paying my landlord $240k in that span. I decide leave my home and move to the Elon base on Mars. When I move out, my nice landlord pays me $66k in accrued equity in the home.

I could be convinced that these numbers are more unfair to either landlord or tenant and need to be adjusted, but I consider it a massive improvement over current tenant-landlord relationships.

Anyway I'm training him cuz I'm the only person on my team that trains other managers. I found out today that when he was offered the job it was with $3 more than what I'm getting. Which in all honesty pisses me off. 

I have more experience in the field and a completed batchlors degree on top of the fact that my boss has me as her go to person for training and working on special projects. My friend has college credits but it's his first time in the field.

It really hits hard because he is a new hire and I've been here for months and they see I'm capable enough to train others so soon.

The job ad said 26 hours/week, which would have matched perfectly with me currently finishing my bachelor's degree. The salary was so-so, but sufficient for me to make a living.

The first round of interview already was kind of a red flag. It was a 'surprise interview' over the phone, meaning that I received a call from HR which started of with some quite harmless questions that gradually became more 'job interview'-like. I didn't receive any heads-up that this would happen and was wholly unprepared.

It seems that I did pretty well anyway, because I was invited for the next interview with HR and two division managers - this time in person. They questioned me for about an hour, after which I was able to ask the questions I had prepared for them.

Turns out the advertised 26 hours/week were never an option. The workplace is closed for 9 whole weeks during summer and they were expecting me to do enough overtime beforehand which would compensate for 9 weeks not going to work in a row.

I was given two options. 1. I could work way more than said 26 hours and use up the excess hours during summer. 2. I could sign up for way less hours than 26, then work exactly 26 hours to generate overtime, meaning I would earn substantially less than expected.

I wrote them today to say that I am not able to work under these circumstances and that I hereby withdraw my application.

I'm one of the ""lucky"" ones. I am good at my job but that does not matter. Just got my W2 and after doing the math I made about 27.5$ an hour.

In 2021 I made  50,100.  Dived that by 52 weeks, divide that by 35 hours, works out to 27.5.

Im also lucky because I ""get"" to work the long weekend hour shifts. It is true, I want those, because those are the most profitable shifts per hour. It does suck sometimes not being able to have a life. I sacrifice my life for a decent wage.

Wage is all I get, no healthcare or vacation or 401k or anything else. 

So my question. Even at 27.5 an hour. I still feel I'm struggling. I have enough to pay rent and bills and even save. I am in no way living the life of luxury. So my question, HOW THE FUCK CAN SOME ONE LIVE ON 15 DOLLARS AN HOUR? 

My point. 15 isn't even close to a livable wage. Unless you rent is like 400$ a month. Even still, that is such garbage. Furthermore minimuge is 7.25?????? HOW THE FUCK CAN ANYONE EVEN BEGIN TO OWN A CAR, LET ALONE RENT A PLACE, WITH THAT LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY????

How do people do it? I know there are some tax breaks for super low income. How do you even get a shitty apartment at 15$ an hour? Do you get overtime to compensate for that terrible wage? 

Overall, 15$ an hour is still a terrible wage. 25 may be a start if you get the full 40 per week. At least 30 if you are getting no benefits for hourly workers.

TL;DR- Union forced a new bargaining session; suddenly corporate is giving us all $5 an hour for one month

I've worked for a large grocery store on the west coast of the US for the last 7 years. We haven't been paid enough, ever. But my job keeps my bills paid and I honestly enjoy the work.

Late 2019, we forced to bargaining session. Early 2020, we had rejected their final offer and we're prepping for a strike vote, one that would have easily passed.

Then the pandemic hit. We put the strike on hold and we put our nose to the grindstone and worked through it. Credit where credit is due, my company did a damn good job protecting its workers. But our essential worker bonus was 25¢ to 75¢ an hour and even that was discontinued by July. 

 We continue  working with every department short staffed. New hires were slowed down; they reinstated  but now they can't even find anyone to hire. Automatic raises were discontinued (""put on hold for a year"").

 Late last year, the union won a legal battle where my company had to let us know what their profits had been. Surprise! Grocery stores did very well during the pandemic. Profits are up 25% and cash on hand has increased by over 1.5 billion dollars.

This year, the union pressed for another bargaining session and got it. It was announced last Thursday and just speaking with my coworkers, I can tell that everyone is down for a strike if we do not get a fair offer.

Then on Monday, corporate announces that all workers will be receiving a $5 an hour bonus pay for the month of February.  Again, I can only speak for the 40 or so co-workers I've talked with, but every one of us sees this for the bullshit it is.

They're willing to spend a few million dollars to try and keep us happy? Go ahead! We still want a fair agreement for a living wage. I personally will happily take all that money and squirrel it away for my personal strike fund.

I have Sundays and Mondays off. Sundays a me day, but on Monday I report to the union office for my strike captain training. If the strike doesn't happen and we get a fair shake, I'm happy. But if we do strike, those bastards are going to watch me put in 12 hour days working for something I believe in.

I work at a job part time. I have worked at this job for about half a year and often when asked to work extra hours at the end of my shift I would agree most of the time and work extra hours. At the end of my shift today I checked with my manager when I was off and went to clock out they asked if I could stay longer and I said I couldn't. I then went to clock out at the time clock and while walking there the boss in charge of everyone asked me if I could stay a few hours longer. I told him very directly no and he tried to guilt trip me and say he needs me to stay and I again told him in a very stern tone no and stood my ground. My boss after that then basically threw a fit of rage became very rude and threw a tempter tantrum and threatened to cut my hours to the minimum and asked me if he should do that. My boss then told me I was being rude cause I was talking to him as I was on the way to the time clock.

All I had said when my boss asked was no and I said nothing more. He then said the way I spoke was disrespectful and was asking me if I would never work extra hours. I kept my cool and told him as politely as I could that I have worked extra hours many times, but today I did not want to and I was clocking out and I wanted to go home. I feel like my trust in my boss is now shattered and I feel like when I come back to work after my day off I am going to have my boss start trying to set me up to be fired or make my life as miserable as possible to try to get me to quit. How should I proceed? Was I in the wrong or is my boss in the wrong or did we both act the wrong way?

Update: Read the posts. I am going to keep my checks that I got from my work so I have documentation showing paychecks and if they cut my hours I can show on new checks that I am making a lot less. I am also going to take pictures and document my schedule for the upcoming weeks and previous weeks before this incident so I have proof to show if my hours get cut. One last question for everyone: If I am at work and my boss again asks for me to stay after my shift should I or no? Last thing is I also have began applying for new jobs just in case things go south and my boss decides to fire me.",1643865530.0

For example [and please correct me if I'm wrong]
48k minimum wage would be a joke in California or NY but maybe would last longer in Mississippi.

Asking for a uniform [1 size fits all] solution to this problem is still asking for trouble, and by trouble, I mean even more debate. More debate in the current American system would only lead to more of nothing being done.

In order to get through this issue, a ""living wage"" has to be defined. Remember that our politicians would do anything to keep things the way they are.

They are messed up enough to say to define what ""living"" is.
They'd then say something effed up like that to breathe is to live and therefore, raising wages isn't  necessary. 

This is my version: living wages are NET wages that pay for ALL of the following without the need for overtime, 2 jobs, or a degree:

1. Rent/Mortgage
2. Food
3. Electricity 
4. Utilities [water, gas, WIFI]
5. Investing 30%
6. Savings 30%
7. Health based expenses without needing a network (insurance)
8. Transportation [including legal bills like but not limited to registration, state inspection, etc]

If a person needs credit to break even on any of these things, then wages are too low. Wages can be raised but never lowered.

Wages MUST be adjusted based on the prices of the above items.

Before saying it can't be done [or shouldn't be done], just remember that some things were FORCED upon us. 
I didn't select car insurance. The state and the threat of being locked up MADE me. I didn't want to pay the Dept of Transportation to keep my car legal nor a driver's license. List goes on.

sizz3z,Told not to discuss pay,17,0.99,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sizz3z/told_not_to_discuss_pay/,13,"Hi,

My coworker recently got a second job at a fragrance store (not naming it cause she is very scared of getting fired somehow and asked me not to, but it is commonly found in malls in the United States at least and sells candles, body spray, etc). We are in Colorado if that matters.

She says during her orientation she was explicitly told not to tell anyone else what she is being paid ""because it might be higher than some people who have worked here longer"" and was told that if anyone asks to tell them that she wasn't comfortable sharing that or to make something up. She says it was explicitly stated in the orientation, I'm not sure if it was a video or a manager telling her this. 

As far as I know, this is illegal and I told her that. She was hoping to find out if there's a way to anonymously report this and how to go about that. She is trying to help her parents buy a house and needs the extra income right now so if there's a way she can do this without them finding out it was her that would be great. It's an at will state and we're pretty sure they would have no qualms about firing her and finding another reason if they had to explain why, and she doesn't have the time or money to pursue a legal case against them if that was to happen. It was hard enough for her to find a second job that could work with her current availability. 

If anyone knows the specific process of reporting something like this that would be great. Also, if anyone works at this same store please let me know if you were told the same thing because we would both like to know if it was just happening at that location or if it's a broader issue.

Thanks!",1643836172.0

I know we all believe that work is important and it is part of how we justify our place in society.

That's great and I want to believe that because it would anchor me and motivate me to succeed.  If it were 1960, I might believe that.

But I just don't understand what we are all working to justify our place in anymore.  Climate change?  Wealth disparity?  Structural racism?  Some dystopian online metaverse?

What is this society working toward?  We are building a grave for ourselves.  Why should I want to work to be a part of that?

How about... I DESERVE a place in this world, and these capitalist titans are actively trying to take that world away from me.  They are actively trying to recruit me and demand that I help them destroy the world that I deserve to be a part of.  The world that I deserve to work on.

Are we gonna follow these crazies into outer space and help mine asteroids for them?!

What is the point of working if we are just working for PRODUCTION, for the rich, and not working toward healing the planet?  Or our society?

Most $7.25 hr jobs do not offer insurance and if they do it is   un-affordably high premiums and high co-pays. Slave Wages are set by the  government so until they decide to stop subsidizing Corporations hings  will not change.

At one point unpaid internships were used to build experience in certain fields, like apprenticeships. Now companies use it to exploit cheap (free) labor. Even the trades pay apprentices now. I think companies should pay interns.

Independent Contractors are a way to avoid paying taxes, benefits, and liability. I think stricter laws defining what is considered an employee, and what can be considered a contractor, would help eliminate this loophole.

I didn't get any acknowledgement from admin until I followed up several days later, and even then it was ""oh, yes, you should have sent that to \[new HR/finance person that I hadn't met and didn't even know she had started working yet\] but we did you the courtesy of forwarding it to her.""  

Lovely.  
  
Fast forward to December and I realize I need to give them my new address so my W-2 doesn't get mailed to our last apartment. So I reach out to that HR/finance person with the new address and ask her to confirm receipt. No reply. I follow up twice before the end of the year. No reply. No acknowledgement of any kind. For all I know I emailed a black hole.  
  
Finally I reach out to my former manager, who I'm pretty sure has no involvement in the W-2 issuing process. She \*does\* reply and says she'll look into it for me. We exchange a couple emails but I don't get any confirmation that the address has been updated or whether I can just come by and pick up the document in person.  
  
A few days back I get an email from the executive director with my W-2 attached in a locked PDF. Great, I got the W-2, now I just have to worry about the hard copy ending up in someone else's mailbox. So I reply to her and ask if they got that mailing address update. She replies and says ""Yes, I think so."" Very reassuring.  
  
My old manager reaches out and says ""just want to make sure you got your W-2. If not email HR/finance person.""

From [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/briefing/labor-shortage-part-time-workers-us.html)

Executives at many companies have decided that part-time work is too important to abandon just because the labor market is temporarily tight. 

The shift toward flexible, **part-time and often outsourced work is a major reason that corporate profits have risen in recent decades.** After-tax corporate profits have accounted for more than 7 percent of national income in recent years, up from an average of 5.6 percent from the 1950s through the 1970s, according to the Commerce Department. 

Companies have been able to insist on so much part-time work largely because they have more negotiating power over workers than in the past. The corporate sector is [more consolidated](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/opinion/big-business-mergers.html) than it was decades ago, leaving the average employer with more resources and the average worker with fewer alternatives in any given industry. 

Workers, for their part, are much less likely to belong to a union than in the past. And union members make more money than similar nonunion workers.

Last month, **unionized workers at King Soopers**, a supermarket chain mostly in the Denver area and owned by Kroger, **went on strike**. They made the growth of part-time work a central issue. In the strike’s settlement, **Kroger agreed to contract language that will likely lead it to add 1,000 or more full-time jobs** over the next three years. 

The House has passed [a bill called the PRO Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/business/economy/joe-biden-unions.html) that **would make it easier for workers to form unions**, and President Biden supports it. Among other things, the bill would bar companies from requiring employees to attend anti-union meetings and would **impose financial penalties on companies that fire workers for trying to organize a union.**",1643824806.0

sitgz1,“Customer Service” ruined service jobs.,47,0.96,WorkReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/sitgz1/customer_service_ruined_service_jobs/,17,"When you consider how hard the idea of “customer service” used to be pushed as a training tool and motivational ploy for employers and employees for the past 15 to 20 years, it seems like a short-sighted plan that is backfiring. 

Employers drilled into workers that they needed to provide better customer service than the competitors, regardless of their pay rate. 90% of training is customer service focused. 

This only made customers eventually feel justified in being a bully and harassing employees because the employee is bound to provide perfect customer service or lose their job. 

Now employees are fed up with smiling at every jerk who demands something unreasonable for low pay. Would more money help? It depends. 

The main way employers try to supply consistently good fresh customer service is simply to have a turnover rate that brings new employees who will bust their butts at beginning to show good customer service so they don’t lose their job. Once you get burned out facing the angry public, the boss replaces you for cheap naive talent. 

How can we counteract this specific trend?",1643820745.0

So we talked and I get the feeling like she thinks I'm doing nothing all day. 

Get upstairs and no boss. I talk with my coworker all one of them. And I wait. Keep in mind so far I haven't started working at all for the day. About 30 minutes later get a text from my boss - so sorry I totally forgot! I was working and time got away from me.

I'm like wait you forgot that you were going to talk to me and give me my W2? You forgot that I would have to drive 20 round trip miles at $4.69 a gallon....yeah...

He then asked if I would come in the next day my day off. So this is the third or fourth time he has forgotten Wednesdays are my day off. I have had this schedule for almost a year. I'm like how about Thursday? Oh fine, fine. Then I said you call me when you are ready and I'll drive over. 

Oh? Well, ok I guess he says. He mentions meeting with another coworker at 1 p.m. and I'm like shit...he is going to cut my hours again....I don't know that for sure but February is notorious for my hours getting cut.

18 per hour. I call back the recruiter and tell her what I saw via voicemail. I just got off the phone 10 mins ago where she sounded a bit nervous but would call about the position and call me back. 

I'm sick of the phone tag being played. I'm glad I got an interview at another company tomorrow. This staffing agency is full of boo boo.

Instead, we've seen just straight evil business practices. Walmart increasing their minimum wage, not out of the goodness of their heart, but to close down more competitors. Then release a large group of their employees and replace them with robotic checkout. Worst of all still, it's not enough. With inflation 7$ an hour isn't enough - nor is 15.

After another night of work I had the pleasure of hitting a deer. Overall my night sucked. I was talked to for not doing my job correctly. Apparently things that happen on my days off can be my problem. I was already tired. Tired of not making enough to even buy clothes for myself because my son has needs. Tired of not getting to go anywhere when I get a vacation because I simply can't afford it. I'm almost 40 and I feel like I haven't lived at all. I been working since I was 16. For what?

Now I have a $500 deductible to go with the $2500 medical deductible I'm currently trying to pay back. I just feel so defeated. We're working to make a better life for our kids and we can barely keep our head above water. I worry for my son and what his generation may have to go through.

The daycares around here can't keep any staff. We found out it's because they pay next to nothing. They raise prices, cut down the hours they watch my son (citing less staff available), but don't raise pay to fix it. Meanwhile we have to bend over backwards because these hours aren't at all compatible with actual working parents. 8-4 doesn't do anything for a 9-5 parent. A 8-4 parent wouldn't benefit either because they'd always have to go to work late and leave early. They'd be fired. It's frustrating.

I don't know if my rant connects with anyone here. But I know I just feel trapped. Trapped in my job. Trapped in my life. My son is my only source of happiness. But I'm nobody. Nepotism rules it seems to me,  and what can I possibly give him to get him ahead? My debt? My worn out boots or ragged clothes? The false promise that college brings opportunities?

A change is so desperately needed. Politicians that work for us. People that will undo this corporate greed that has infiltrated our government and turned us into nothing more than wage slaves of an imperfect system. People that don't just sell their souls, side with a party, and follow the money. I hope this group can actually organize and lead the way towards change. Not just share stories and talk about it. But actually do something. Create a force so strong that it can not possibly be ignored.

I’ve worked in IT at my company in QA for the past 2 years. About 1.5 months ago I got promoted to Business Analyst immediately before there was a mass resignation at the company.

We had 11 people in QA 4 months ago. Of those 11 only 4 remain plus 2 additional hires who have been working here about 1 month. 

The job is actually pretty chill and work-life balance and benefits are good.. but the pay was far below industry standard. For over a year QA talked to upper management to tell them that they wanted us to do system configuration, write automation code, and do testing, but are not willing to pay a fair wage (about $10-15k more per year above our base pay).

Management kept saying “changes are coming” or “there isn’t money in the HR budget” and gave us COLA plus 3% and told us to deal with it. They said the job only required a couple years of experience and the pay matched the skills required to do the job (despite them having increased the skill requirements over the past several years with no pay increases). They also undervalued QA and didn’t see them as essential as the higher paid roles.

Than one by one multiple people started giving notice about 2 weeks apart moving on to jobs that paid more.

Upper management is now concerned that all QA staff will leave. They can’t find people at the current salary to replace these staff and the ones they have hired are bottom of the barrel and make so many mistakes it’s costing the company a lot of money to fix them.

Projects are getting delayed, stakeholders are getting unhappy, and there’s now a huge bottleneck where work can’t be released because there isn’t enough QA to do their part. Upper management is now getting developers and other members of IT who make $10-50k more per year than QA to take on QA tasks to fill in the gap which is taking them away from their actual jobs. These people are struggling as well because they don’t realize the kind of knowledge and skill required to actually do QA and associated work at my company.

We are now entering our busiest two months of the year and management is in a panic. The sad part is they still can’t fathom why everyone is leaving and are addressing everything BUT the pay issues.

TLDR: Management and HR refuse to pay QA staff the market rate, making half of them leave which are causing delays on projects and forcing other IT workers who make significantly more than QA to have to do QA work",1643794402.0
