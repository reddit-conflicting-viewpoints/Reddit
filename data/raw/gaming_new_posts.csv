spmfig,I recently forgot how to have fun,0,0.4,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/spmfig/i_recently_forgot_how_to_have_fun/,7,"So recently I've been into stressfull time due to exams but here""s the main fact: I wanted (and still won't) to play with some friends but, unfortunately for me, they only play lol and Valorant.

 I don't like lol because I find stressfull its movement system, about Valorant it's not like I totally dislike it, I mean, I dislike its csgo style shooting system but I could have beared with it if actually I had the chance to play: dying over and over the whole time. 

After the horrible experience I noticed how a decent matchmaking balancement is needed to actually have fun matches. It's not like a win or lose problem, I'm used to losts.

A week ago I had my lasts games at Valorant, I totally tilted, 2 hours spent in not playing, watching others playing, making someone else have fun and being meat cannon.

Now I always feel totally stressed, after I spend the whole day studying I'd like to play and have fun with friends but in Valorant I can't even play because of unfair matches where I can just walk around

From that day I don't manage to relax when I get some free time: I tried some For Honor but since when they changed mechanics it's quite difficult to me to do something, I tried Sniper Elite 4 and I do stupid mistakes over and over (in my first run I didn't have much problems playing it since beginning), I tried playing ironsight, it started decently but Yesterday i didn't manage to find a single lobby that could suit my level, etc. Whatever I do I always do stupid mistakes that doesn't let me play and enjoy.

I even wanted to try to play double dragon neogeo every time I die in Valorant (not playing it now, it's too early) and see if stress is minor like that but the current emulator crash whenever I switch window.

I have just few free time because of university and I only wanna have fun in free time, trying to get decent aim and study the game would be useless to me (plus, I already study enough and it's not fun studying to me). I won't be able to really improve decently, plus I find more fun learning on the battlefield instead of watching boring tutorials. I repeat, it's not about winning or losing, I prefer losing a match that I actually played then winning one in which I do nothing

You have any advice that could help me? (no ""git good"" and other toxic bullshits please)

Any ideas on how to get myself super hype?",2,0.67,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/spkz91/im_about_to_play_my_favorite_game_fallout_4_for/,4,"A few years ago on r/Fallout, I posted about how Fallout 4 was my favorite game of all time, and had saved my life, but my OCD had ruined the game for me and made me an anxious wreck when I tried to play it. It seemed to strike a chord with the sub because I stayed within like the top 5 posts on the sub for several weeks. A lot of people gave me a lot of support. Someone offered to send me an old computer of theirs incase having better graphics helped, someone even coded a mod for me they thought could help me. Sadly the nature of OCD is odd and nothing could fix it. The love I got from this community meant more than I could ever express to a slightly younger me who was in a real bad place and didn't have a lot of friends.

(Edit: for anyone curious the OCD issue I had was related to the fact that certain combos of weapons and armor would allow for you to see worn armor pieces to move in your FOV when you walked. As this was on of the my first very noticeable issues with OCD, I originally thought it was a bug and I was just noticing it. However it turns out it was just a tiny and sensible detail that my brain had only then noticed and decided to latch on to, and my obsession with it made me so anxious I could play the game comfortably. This issue has plagued me since I was about 13.)

But It's been 2 years or so now. And I've come a long way, and I've begun to overcome a lot of my struggles with OCD. Over the course of the last few months, I've introduced my younger sister to Skyrim. She's played Minecraft on her computer before, What Remains of Edith Finch on my PS4, and had 1v1ed me poorly in Call of Duty a couple times. This was all her gaming experience. She asked me for something ""like What Remains of Edith Finch"" so I did what any good big brother would do and I said ""no here's what you're really looking for"" and sat her down in front of Skyrim. Skyrim was probably my next most important childhood game beside Fallout 4, but for years I'd struggled to find the motivation to get past the first few hours. It was seeing my little sister playing that gave me that motivation again. Teaching her how to fight and about the lore and just generally helping her and being the ""big brother who knows this game like the back of his hand"" was amazing, and it made me want to play for myself. So I brought my PC downstairs and set it up at a desk in the same room as the PS4 my sister was playing at, and for the first time since I was probably 12 or 13, I started a new Skyrim game. I could chat with my sister about the game and guide her through things when she got stuck and it was a nice bonding thing. On my first playthrough in 4-5 years, I played a character to level 50 for the first time in all my 2000+ hours of play. I did all the DLC, I roleplayed and made choices like my character and I got into the game and did every side quest I could. It felt amazing. In this time my sister played one character (a good simple warrior) to level 38 and almost did everything the game has to offer and then played another character to level 45 (a stealth archer which I encouraged because I wanted her to learn more ""gaming skills"" and try something a bit harder) and almost finished everything in the game again. Like the kid almost 100%ed it. I've never even done that!!! The kid has really experienced a lot of what it means to ""play videogames"" if you know what I mean, and I'm proud of her and love her for learning so well (Edit: Oh my god I checked and it's been a YEAR since we first started. I cannot believe that.)

She finished her second playthrough about a week ago and I finished mine on Tuesday. As I mentioned I got her to play a stealth archer. This is to practice one essential skill... aiming. Right after she finished her first character I'd come up with an idea. I'd make this a thing I do with her. We'd play the games that meant most to me at the same time and we could do it with tons of other games. And I knew that was next had to be Fallout 4. I know that being with my little sister and having that reason to push through any bad feelings of boredom or anxiety will allow me to play and make the most out of Fallout 4 again. And as it's the only game more important than Skyrim, it'd be the next game.

My sister is extremely excited to play now, and has been getting more and more antsy to play it over the last few months. On Saturday, we are gonna wake up nice and early, do a bit of an ""opening ceremony"" with us and my friend (who lives with us and will be joining us this time but play Fallout New Vegas while we play 4.), and play all day and all night. It sounds corny but hey. It's bonding. I want her memories of us living together and her first memories of really getting into videogames to be good. It won't be long before I've moved out and videogames will be a slightly less new and exciting part of her life.

I was also feeling the excitement but then I just got a bit stressed and now I've got a cold!!!

So if you guys are still reading and wouldn't mind, 1st of all thank you for caring enough to read all of this story, and 2nd... what do you think are some ways to get myself really excited again. Bring me back to those ""Fallout 4 is new and fresh!!!"" days and feelings. I've thought about listening to some songs from the radio and sound track, and I've gone back and watched all the trailers. This has for sure done something for me, but I need something to really get me jumping with excitement. To get me out of my high stress post cold unable to get hyped mood. To make me excited to return to the Commonwealth, the a world I know like the back of my hand but haven't seen in nearly 5 years, but this time with my little sister, and in doing this, earning a victory of a mental illness that has almost ended my life, and has held so joy hostage from me for so long.

Any ideas are welcome. Thanks for reading!!!

TL;DR: What are some ideas to get excited for returning to Fallout 4, my favorite game, for the first time in half a decade.",1644538719.0

Years and years ago, I used to play a Game, a web browser game as the Title of the Post says. I got weird nostalgia effect, and the game came to my mind out of nowhere but I cannot recall the name of it.

Things I remember about the game:

It was both F2P and P2W.

The Player had a City that could be renamed, upgraded and build different buildings in it.

In the City, player could produce a variety of units which he/she could use to raid other players or could send it to the AI. If the player sent it to the AI, the player could get units back from it, so like some sort of trade system, trash units for better ones.

The attacks the player did took an amount of time depending on the units the player sent, so for example, mounted troops took less time than melee. I do recall the game having dragons.

The game also allowed clans/alliances and said clan/alliances to takeover beacons so as to gain map influence and bonuses that came along. These beacons could also be defended with player troops.

The player could also siege other players so as to gain some sort of passive income from said enemies.

Players could also take their units and set them on their base as a sort of defense vs other players and hope to repell enemy forces. Players could also send their troops to other players as a form of defense so as to crush the enemy force.

Last thing I remember is that I belonged to a Clan/Alliance named Knights of Camelot (KOC for short). Pretty sure it had other sub clans, KOCII for example.

Edit 1:

It was not a Mobile Game.

Its art was not cartoonish/animeish.

I'd rather have the new Pokémon game, than the traditional mainline ones with amazing graphics. Why? The mainline series is dull, old, and doesn't innovate enough. The new game does. I can easily look past crappy graphics. 

Graphics do not matter. Too many games have an emphasis on graphics and not gameplay systems because graphics sell a game easier than complex or interesting gameplay. This has been made obvious with the thousand + ""Pokémon game look bad, game isn't that good"" posts on this sub. 

If the gameplay was worse, but the graphics were amazing, I'd be confident in saying people would be drooling over it and saying how amazing it was. 

This isn't to say good graphics can't add to a game, it can for sure, but for me 8/10 times I'll take the game with good gameplay over good graphics. Anyone remember ""The Order 1886""? That game looked amazing, the gameplay sucked. I much rather have it the other way. Looks dated but plays well and has interesting gameplay.",1644536233.0

sphofk,[Help?] My microphone wire is picking up... Radio?,4,0.84,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sphofk/help_my_microphone_wire_is_picking_up_radio/,10,"Loosely a gaming question because I wanted to use a voice changer/sound effect board when I play online with friends, but today I noticed something weird.

While the physical microphone is OFF, my computer is still detecting input from the wire. I verified this by unplugging the wire, and no longer getting input.

I'm using two lengths of cheap extension wire from the computer to my microphone, so the wire circles 1/4 of the room. If I unplug the physical microphone from the extensions, the input is just static, with no discernable sounds. But while fully plugged in, and physical microphone still OFF, I'm picking up a radio show. Something about Tom Brady and VR. Nothing being listened to in the house, that's for sure. 

My guess is that this cheap wire is acting as a sort of radio antennae a la Braceface.

Luckily, when I do turn on the physical microphone, the louder I turn the dial, the quieter the radio show gets, so it *shouldn't* interfere with what I'm doing. But how the heck would I fix this besides getting quality components? Wrap my wires in tinfoil to try and shield them?

Have you guys experienced this kind of thing? I can literally open Audacity and press Record, and it'll record the radio show. It's super weird.",1644528750.0

I absolutely destroyed him in our first match together. 

Over time me and him played together many times on the game and I've seen him grow. I'm not the best player, but I average having the highest points in the game, with him right behind me.

Unfortunately, after the DDOS attacks on Titanfall 2 my childhood game, we both stopped and it was really depressing since I planned on getting more of my younger relatives into it.
However, we decided to play again, but this time 1v1 against each other and it was great. We decided to use titans and loadouts that we never used or had little experience in and out of 8 matches he beaten me 6 times. 

So in our last 5 matches we decided to use our usual loadouts when we played and it was very interesting and fun because we both have almost identical playing styles. Even though I beaten him out of all 5 matches. He was always a few points behind me and has almost won a couple of games.
Anyways my bad for the long post, but I was proud of my little brother and consider him my equal in terms of skill and luck lol.

sph1of,Most console games should have gyro aiming,1,0.55,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sph1of/most_console_games_should_have_gyro_aiming/,5,"My general thought is that gyro aiming should be a standard option in every game where you have to aim and shoot. This not only helps to people trying to switch to consoles, but also makes the whole gaming experience more entertaining and easier.

I’m new to console gaming. Never had one. I’ve been avoiding consoles mostly because I got used to a mouse+keyboard set. Recently, I got myself my first Nintendo switch, Xbox and play station.
The first console game that I tried was Zelda: Breath of The Wild. I didn’t have to get used to it. Aiming with a bow felt so natural. Then I played Far Cry, Battlefield and Doom. I liked these games so much on PC, but hated playing them on the console. I finished Doom:Eternal to get used to a controller, btw. 
Then I played Days Gone.
I was so happy, and it was such a relief. The whole game you have to shoot, aim, and throw something. With gyroscope it was so natural and fun.
All I needed was a little adjustment with the gyroscope. I aim primarily with sticks, but finish with gyro.
Now, playing without it is kinda painful.

Adaptive triggers in dual sense and the whole vibration theme was not that fun for me like the gyroscope was.

I found Soul series really easy even on NG+7 (hardest diff?) once you get the patterns down and the screen also gives you all necessary information, and that's **GREAT** game design, nothing against that, it's **FAIR** difficulty.

But damn, have they ever experienced the madness of ""Master Ninja"" in NG or ""Hell and Hell"" in DMC or older games when they are trying to bring DS up? I'm talking about the extreme difficulties, of course, Soul series NG+7 vs hardest of fast-paced games where you have to deal with literal chaos that kill you off in a single hit. The extreme side of Soul is nothing compared to them imo.

However, there are a lot of issues that need addressed right now. The overall state of the game industry in general and it's current monetization practices being exhibited by Rockstar Games and other companies such as Epic Games or BlizzardActivision - Is killing us softly, there is no denying it.

Many of my friends I used to play with on the daily have since quit, not just RDO or GTA, but damn near quit playing video games completely. All we have being offered to us are the same old AAA titles, which have rehashed content with even more rehashed content on top of it. Not to mention the huge emphasization on microtransactions and the creation of ""Battle Passes"" for nearly every online game. This brings me to my next point I'd like to make, which is developer morale.

Developers in general are getting lazy, which is not the fault of the little man. It is however the fault of each companies main constituents who enforce these lazy and greedy policies - That in turn, creates a base of workers that are fearing to speak up and create their own ideas - This creates an environment where people lack the necessary creativity and freedom to make FUN games! Video games used to be about self-expression and most importantly having fun (especially with friends!). Nowadays, you are lucky to purchase a game that has access to things such as splitscreen or a single-player campaign mode with hand crafted assets and environments. As all the focus has shifted to the online aspect, and the ability for developers to make money off of in-game purchases.

We see more bugs than ever because IT IS ENCOURAGED for programmers to simply read off each others code, or to even copy and paste things just to get it done before the deadline. With people like Micosoft buying out many of the once large household name tech companies, we are entering an era of which that is inhospitable for the artist. The individual who seeks to create something unique, or a step above the rest. For the last couple of years especially, I have since quit playing many new games also, and instead have been occasionally starting up old titles just to get that nostalgic feel again. What I am asking for is not just some nostalgia trip or micro-transaction-less experience, but rather a return to form of some kind.

I hope any and all who reads this has a wonderful day, life, whatever - Stay safe and don't get 360 noscoped by covid 19.",1644514248.0

I know this might be a stupid question because it totally relies on me being able to commit to something, but I figured I’d ask for some advice anyways.

I’m a pretty slow gamer. When I hear people beating a game within a week, I’m amazed. When I pick up a new game, I usually play it nonstop whenever I have the chance and then I just randomly stop playing for a day or two then never come back to it. It’s not even that I don’t like the games, cause I do. A lot of the games I do this with I was really enjoying.

I end up not playing the games for like a month. But when I actually do come back to the game, I feel weird picking it up in the middle cause I might have forgotten what was going on at the time. So I usually end up restarting the whole thing, but sometimes I feel off just restarting a game halfway through that I just played like a month ago, so I end up not picking it back up so I am able to justify restarting the whole thing in my head after having a longer period of time between.

I think there is something wrong with me lmao.

After 4/5 live chats and some extremely rude customer service (closing chats mid conversation, transferring etc..) I got through to a helpful agent. I stated my case on all 3 points:
- the product was not fit for purpose
- the product was not as described 
- the product was not to a satisfactory quality

I also made the point very clear there was now evidence online on this Reddit of a user stating this exact argument and getting a refund, along with the fact EA’s refund rules do not over ride the law in the country the game was sold in. (Sorry US folk)

After some back and forth, and please note I have only played 30 hours before packing this game in, after playing bf3/4 for hundreds of hours, I said the final: 

Game is poorly optimised. Unprepared for launch. Full of bugs. Doesn’t provide the additional content promised to gold edition

Refund hit my account today - please feel free to use this post in your case as they did not have a comeback when I showed that there is evidence online - partly why I think the last post has been removed.",1644510635.0
spah8e,Logitech F710 wireless controller,2,0.75,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/spah8e/logitech_f710_wireless_controller/,5,Does anyone have any ideas about why the dongle for the controller listed above craps out when I reset or cold boot? Device manager says there is something wrong until I remove and replug the dongle. It happens every time the pc reboots or cold boots. I've had it close to a year mostly for driving games that I don't play much of but now the FF7 has the 60fps mod I started playing it again and this problem is rather annoying.

The dev cycle on modern games is insane, we have games on the horizon that were developed as tech demos for two console generations ago.

Scoring: Metacritic score 30 days after release contributes to your overall totals

Roster: initially I was thinking that every month would occupy a roster slot. With so many delays, that doesn’t seem feasible? Maybe just 10 games with any release date with a few ‘bench’ games in reserve in case a game gets delayed out of the year. I’m thinking 12 active roster with 3 bench/reserve spots that only contribute if an active game is delayed out of the year.

Team count: It’s only the two of us right now as he is the only other person I know who actively keeps up with the industry. This might be ok as I worry we would have trouble picking games from a pool of 100s.

Draft: initial draft conducting in the next in a serpentine pattern. Supplemental draft conducted post July to deal with surpriseish announcements.

**So, out of ALL of these games there are only three new games. One is entirely new (Triangle Strategy) and the other two are MP games (Lego Brawls and the FTP Disney Speedstorm). The industry (not just Nintendo) has a major problem. There needs to be new IP's added to keep the industry fresh and new. It's already evident that gamers are getting tired of all of these re-hashes, ports, and sequels. Also multiplayer online-only games and other GAAS are getting old. There are only a few really popular ones while the others fall away into obscurity.**

The game is primary played in a mouse/keyboard setting but has a side game or crafting aspect to the game where you could use your phone. Maybe the game doesn't have a dedicated app but maybe the farming/crafting/character upgrade can be done in a mobile friendly environment. I'm not looking to just ""view my stats"" in the app, I'm looking to actively engage with the game. 

Ideally this would be a multiplayer game that my friends could join in. 

Some thoughts* I know I could play an android game through a simulator on PC, but that's not ideal

Additionally the goal is to have a game my friends and I could play when we have an hour or 2 at night and all hop on our PCs, but could casually do minor side activities with when away from home/your PC.

I'm conducting a review on Player Balancing mechanics in multiplayer competitive games, so I'd like to collect more examples of these mechanics in commercial games, and this is where I need your input. These mechanics would be ones that enable low-performing players to catch-up with stronger players (either by benefiting those weaker players or by handicapping the high-performing ones), during a single match.

**Examples:**

* Ultimate Chicken Horse: You can change the percentage of points you get on the score card. For example, 50% means that you get half as many points as you normally would.
* Mario Kart: The probability to obtain better items from item boxes increases the lower your ranking on the race is.

But sometimes, paradoxically, I feel that makes the game world seem *smaller* instead of *larger*. This is because in games that employ fade-to-black transitions to segregate different areas, it allows me to imagine that your character has traveled some distance where nothing much happens, so the game doesn’t show it to you. The only plus side I can think of with seamless open worlds is that feeling you get when that huge landmark off in the distance grows closer with every step and eventually becomes explorable.

Making a seamless open-world game is kind of like trying to make a movie without any cuts. There is this one movie like that called 1917 where it seems as though the action was filmed in one long take. Technically impressive, sure.

God is truth. its the truth that ps3 is superior since bluray is the way of the future with our games becoming increasingly needy of more disc space than can be found on the dvd hence the annoying streak of lame ""10 hours of gameplay for my $60"" which i am experiencing wayy too much nowadays and hence the acknowledge meant of PCs with their installation- to- HD [schemes.MS](https://schemes.MS) is suddenly showing odd and too much interest in "" games for windows"" understanding how the 360 is coming to its end with titles like lost odyssey ranging to 4 discs. is ff13 4 discs long yet i can bet that ff13 contains twice the gameplay hours of lost odyssey's 4 discs combined. wat sort of an age do we live in when games hav to become 4 discs or even 2 discs long. ipod has more space than the dvd. a bluray can contain 50 to 60 gb of space. a dvd can contain 7 gb of space. a hd dvd can contan 20 t0 30 gb of space yet ironically the hd dvd for the 360 isnt made for playing HD dvd games. if its rumble u want then its coming to japan this year. i dunno bout u but im getting mine since my sis lives in japan with her husband and she is parcelling me dual shock 3 twins.ppl say sony doesnt value the customer. i say any franchise that can eat their words like hard candy( rumble is the past) and sell true next gen consoles at staggeringly high losses so that we can enjoy the future doesnt look like the bad guy.blu ray is just one point. the power of the ps3 is a whole new ground. i hav always said ps3's power lies in superior engineering not in som numbers like ram: 512 MB crap. i hav noticed the textures on uncharted and they r (lol) off the charts amazing not to mention motorstorm.a system that has this much power and the disc space to go with that power really looks like the way of the future. id just like to say one more thing and that has to do with criticism. this goes for everything. when analog stix came out every1 criticized it and now look at it. when scarface came out they wanted to rate it XXX and critics went with wat was the popular act at the time and booed it except 1 critic who remained got it right . those same critcs today admit their faults and re-rated scarface as one of the best films of its time. ppl say the ps3 is crap but 1 year or even 6 months from now they wont eat those words because they are gonna b too busy playing mgs 4 to remember to regret the words from their past. not me. i dont ever regret owning a ps3 now and i never will. anyone even thinking of calling me fan boyish think again coz i own both next gen systems and currently just finished halo 3 on legendary alone. had a blast literally",1644488853.0

Like when you're playing The Witcher trilogy, it doesn't really matter which skill tree you specialize Geralt of Rivia in, whether it's combat, magic, or alchemy, because you're still playing The Witcher trilogy as intended.  And when you're playing something like Armored Core or Front Mission, it doesn't really matter if you specialize your mecha for either high mobility, defense/tanking, close-quarters combat, or long-range combat, because you're still piloting either an AC or a Wanzer, and still playing one of these two games as originally intended.

But with Sonic's friends, ever since the Adventure series for the Dreamcast, you *deviate* *too far* from Sonic the Hedgehog's signature speed every time you have to play as any of the other characters.  Whether it's treasure hunting with Knuckles and Rouge, or mech shooting with Gamma, Tails, or Eggman, or fishing like with Big the Cat.

Now with the technology inside of PS5 and Xbox Series X they can actually compete against PC. You can stream on twitch at 1080p 60fps while playing at 120 fps from the consoles now. To get that on PC you’d have to drop way more than you would for a Next Gen console.

So why not just have them together? Why doesn’t Sony just integrate discord better and let people talk like how they do on PC? Have it feeling like PC. Give players 1440p like Xbox does and overall just make it a more streamer friendly console. PS5 still doesn’t let your audio come through to capture cards as easy as Xbox. Have to buy splitters and stuff. If they can get PS5 players to be in lobbies with PC players and talking to PC players on discord then I feel like the PS5 will go up in value. It would be no need for a PC for most people.

sp1c0y,The true cost of a service like Stadia,0,0.37,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sp1c0y/the_true_cost_of_a_service_like_stadia/,39,"Just because I am terrified of the inevitable, I will make this post, as a gamer and as game developer.

Game streaming services like Stadia are bad for you financially in the long term:

The current subscription is 10 dollars a month, that is 120 dollars over one year. Consoles usually have a 5 year cycle.

This means that over the same time period you have paid 600 dollars, that is 200 dollars more than you would for a console.

You might say ""yes but Stadia gives me all of these games for this service, I would need to pay so much money to get the same level of content"".

This is only true for now, it is likely game streaming will follow the trend of video streaming, just like Netflix gave rise to Hulu, Disney plus, Amazon prime, HBO max...

So will other big companies compete with Stadia, these companies will fight with tooth and nail for exclusives, because it is THE only way to attract people to their specific platform for this kind of service. Say that Stadia, and a competitor have 80% of all games split between them, then you would need at least 2 services to enjoy most games now you are paying 1200 dollars over the lifespan of one console. If it is 3 services and you want all 3, it racks up to 1800.

As you can see, the option then becomes into either locking yourself out of most games, or paying significantly more than you did before.

I don't think this will do anything to actually stop the giant corporations that rule the world from getting what they want. But everyone else looses here. I don't want to have to develop for google, I want to develop for different sets of hardware that people own, I like being able to choose if I want my game to be on PC, Xbox, Play Station...

But if everyone gravitates towards this service then I have no choice but to either abandon the industry or let google put a collar around my neck and do what it wants me to do for profit as other giants have done with their storefront.",1644480296.0

soel56,Watch roughly two hours of impressions from the initial Steam Deck hardware reviews.,3,0.64,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/soel56/watch_roughly_two_hours_of_impressions_from_the/,5," 

After a two-month wait, Valve will begin selling the $400 Steam Deck gaming handheld on February 25th — but you won’t have to wait another minute to see the device in reviewers’ hands. GamersNexus, Linus Tech Tips, and The Phawx have all posted comprehensive impressions of the final version of the Steam Deck to YouTube, sharing their comments on ergonomics, performance, battery life, and other topics.

While these aren’t final Steam Deck evaluations — Valve only allowed them to test specific titles and they couldn’t touch the underlying OS — I’m confident you’ll learn something beneficial from each of them if you’re on the fence.

For example, none of them are getting the battery life that Valve has promised, which is crucial for a portable, right? GamersNexus and The Phawx were able to drain it dry in just 1.5 hours without VSync while playing Devil May Cry 5 and Control on higher settings, respectively, and neither of them was able to fulfill Valve’s required eight hours of light play / remote play no matter what they did.

Here are a couple more battery life tests:

2 hours of Devil May Cry 5 with VSync on high settings (GamersNexus)  
VLC 4K 60fps playback at 50% brightness for 3 hours (GamersNexus)  
Dead Cells for 6 hours at 50% brightness (The Phawx, GamersNexus)  
Steam Link streaming for 6 hours at 50% brightness (GamersNexus)  
Portal 2 is restricted at 30 frames per second for 5 hours and 40 minutes (The Phawx)  
4 hours of Forza 5 at 30 frames per second (The Phawx)  
Ghostrunner is capped at 30 frames per second for 3 hours and 21 minutes (LTT)

The Phawx claims that with the Steam Deck, “it’s fairly possible to achieve four hours,” but only if you run games at 30Hz, or half the screen’s frame rate. In a lot of games, I’d be fine with it, but in a racing game like Forza? Ehhh. However, Valve is still working on power-saving measures.

However, performance is the opposite side of battery life, and everyone appears to be as impressed as I was during my initial hands-on. So far, the Steam Deck appears to have completely overtaken other recent portable PCs such as the Aya Neo and GPD Win 3, and you don’t have to take our word for it: To witness for yourself, the Phawx includes ten minutes of side-by-side footage with detailed performance information.

I’d recommend watching the Linus Tech Tips video for ergonomics and other creature comforts, where he praises the joysticks, speakers, and screen (which includes a variety of brightness options, including a lovely dim one for night) but bemoans the rumble. “Right now, the device’s haptics is a poo stain on an otherwise immaculate white sheet,” he says.

Surprisingly, The Phawx claims that the Steam Deck allows you a lot of control over the Aerith chip’s settings, including the ability to park some of the CPU cores if you wish — and that by disabling two cores, he was able to observe a 20% speed gain in an early scene in Control. It’s not uncommon to tweak a handheld PC to get the most out of it, and you shouldn’t have to with the Deck, but it’ll be fascinating to see if the community comes up with some best practices.

So  my little brother purchased NBA 2k22 from the Nintendo eshop thinking  he would be able to play it on his switch without any problems. He was  surprised to learn that there was not enough space on his console to  even download the game let alone play it. First off, this seems  ridiculous. If you're not technically savvy how are you supposed to know  if a game is too big for your console. Isn't that the whole point of a  console? It streamlines the process of gaming? There needs to at least  be an identifier on the store saying ""hey your console can't run this  game"".

Needless to say he wanted  to return the game only to find that there is NO ONLINE PROCESS TO  RETURN GAMES. No, you have to call customer support and we all know that  takes forever. Then, once we were able to return the game, Nintendo  tells me (since I had to call) ""this is a ONE TIME DEAL"". I will NEVER  be allowed to return a game after it has been purchased from the eshop  ever again. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL! I haven't heard of a company refusing a  refund! If Steam can have an amazing no questions asked return policy  why can't Nintendo?! This honestly seems like a MONEY GRAB and it  disgusts me.",1644463436.0

I have not liked a battlefield game since 4. I’m not saying that others haven’t enjoyed one or v. I get the want to innovate and try to improve on something that a lot of people love. It’s not just battlefield either. Maybe I am just getting older and I am missing what they are trying to do. Regardless I see that there is people who make battlefield content starting to show alternatives. I am seeing Insurgency Sandstorm becoming recommended and possibly will gain an injection of new players. Myself included. How ever I think Squad is also a great tactical shooter as well. My point is even though I feel like I need to say good bye to a franchise I have loved since the start of it all. I am also hoping this gives us a chance at really showing that our money and time matters and we are no longer taking on paid betas for AAA companies. EA, Amazon, Battlenet etc… I am done with this crap and so should you. I think for too long we have been slowly normalizing crap releases and hoping for a better version down the road. Even small team devs do this as well. I am talking about you Mortal Online 2. Part of the problem is on me too. Believing in marketing and jumping on hype trains. It’s gotta stop and I for one am no longer going to be supporting games until at least a week into launch. There are too many times people are saying look at what no mans sky did. It doesn’t matter and it shouldn’t be used as a defense. So many games with amazing potential are being ruined because shareholders just don’t care as long as they get their paychecks. If you are asking people to spend money on a game you better deliver. MMO’s that can’t even support the online part at launch, shooter games that become more about cosmetics than actual gun play, toxic environments where chads call each other racial slurs. Where does it end? When will it end. The sad part is honestly never. A realigned game will launch and charge $70 for it. People will just say QQ more, but hey at least they will get the same game over and over right?",1644478171.0

Because there’s always that one insufferable whiny dick that complains about his team not performing to his “high” standards. This applies to multiple games, including League of Legends, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and more. 

In league of legends, it doesn’t matter what mode it is, whether it’s ARAMs, blind pick or normals, someone has to complain about you not playing a meta champ, and even worse goes off if you died twice and call you a retard feeder and threatened to report you. Like wtf. 

In Overwatch, same thing, you play a probably not meta hero, and people start flaming. When you make a mistake, flame. You lost the game? Suddenly it’s your fault for playing an off-meta hero that you find FUN. 

Low ELO matches in both games are a nightmare to play in. 

World of Warcraft? Get vote kicked out of a dungeon because your damage is too low according to a stupid addon and you’re a lower level player. Newbies making a mistake, dying, or pet pulls. Instead of teaching newbies, they yell at them.

So I was thinking what if your video game characters were self aware and pondering that and it led to me having that idea. What if you still control the character but there's a AI that tags along with you the entire game and it's meant to be your character's consciousness. Was thinking the AI would help with decision making but also just generally make the character seem like more then just a character and help create emotional attachment and the AI would have a database of everything you said so it remembers decisions and everything. I think we currently have AI that is advanced enough to really sell that sort of idea but it's very expensive certainly to expensive to incorporate in modern video games which is why I was thinking it would have to be a video game in the future.,1644477371.0

sovbjg,Name a game where META actually ruined it,3,0.64,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sovbjg/name_a_game_where_meta_actually_ruined_it/,13,"META stands for Most Effective Tactic Available and it's most known use is in competitive games like League of Legends or Smash Bros.

However META isn't always good, since sometimes, extreme focus on characters who are in the META usually results in the community trashing on characters that aren't part of that exclusive club or don't carry their team.  Or that the META is so extreme that it spills over into causal play where you're fighting random players online for little to no benefit.

A major example of META hurting a game is Mario Kart Wii.  Before, you could just pick up your favorite character and Kart and race with random players.  But ever since it's META came out along with CTGP, its literally Funky Kong Flame Runner or nothing and the META has been so cemented into this combo that if you don't have this combo, YOU AUTOMATICALLY LOSE!  MK8DX has this to a much minor problem where it's Wild Wiggler and Roller but unlike MKWII, any character and combo with a high skill level could wipe the floor with them.

Another flaw with META is that it might often expose obvious oversights that somehow went past the developers.  Using MKWII for example, how anyone in the dev team looked at the bikes abilities to constantly wheelie and get speed boosts, negate Acceleration stat with stationary boost by holding acceleration and brake button together when your Kart is at a standstill to boost to max speed or how inner drift might completely overpower outside drift bikes and might negate the need to use karts.  And don't even get me started on character specific stat boosts

Might be over cautious or whatever, I don't know. If this kind of post isn't welcome on this subreddit either, please let me know.

***So this is all just pure speculation on my part.*** *I have no insider information. I have no sources. These notes are my own speculation, my own thoughts (and fears) after all the things we've seen and heard over the last days and weeks. I want you to think about it, because this is something I only really realized today and it somewhat all fits together and concerns me. It concerns me a lot for one of the franchises I dearly love and which I spent a large chunk of my gaming time over the last few years.*

>**TL; DR:** BF2042 was indeed well ahead of schedule, might even have been a fun game, a ""True Love Letter to the fans"", but then was butchered to fail to drive the fanbase to Battlefield Mobile for sake of easier/better monetization.

Battlefield 2042 is in a weird state. The game feels like an alpha. Many core gameplay mechanics and details got scrapped, more than usual. Games always lost details or features compared to predecessors, but it's never been as massive as in 2042. Even the public reveal showcased a completely different game. Classes basically gone. Scoreboard gone. Server browser gone. Playing with many friends gone. Platoons gone. More or less out of nowhere we get this weird game, where even many insiders can't tell what went wrong or why and how anyone thought releasing this game would be a good idea. That nobody could be so incompetent ""producing"" and releasing this…

But what if this was all intentional? Doesn't make sense? Oh, it does in a kind of twisted way. We all know the big money is made in mobile markets. Whales are a lot more likely to spend their money in the far more accessible and ""innocent"" mobile games found on the Play and Apple Stores. EA knows it. Activision knows it.

But let's go back. Remember when EA made their first attempts to bring established franchises to mobile? Dungeon Keeper Mobile, anyone?

The game had aggressive monetization and it basically single-handedly killed the brand over night, because not even the biggest fans wanted to play it. Just playing the older games is more fun.

Years passed, then kind of out of nowhere Activision Blizzard attempted something similar: The next Diablo wouldn't be on PC or consoles. It would be mobile exclusive: Diablo Immortal was meant to rake in all the money on mobile. Yet it almost killed the franchise, forcing Blizzard to basically panic, scrap those ideas and haphazardly assemble a team to start an actual Diablo 4. ""Don't you guys have phones?""

Just half a year later, Bethesda tries the same, although a lot more thought through: Revealing Elder Scrolls 6 without any details before announcing a new mobile game. The fan base was skeptical, but not up in arms.

So after digressing a bit, let's go back to today. The last few days I started playing a bit with Irish. I haven't done so before. And overall his voice lines are a lot different in tone compared to other characters. Darker, grim, ""no action hero BS"" (to more or less directly quote him). Let me ask you a question: Out of so many Battlefield characters we've had, why is Irish a specialist? And why only him? What about the others? Like any of the Blackburns? All recent BF games had a Blackburn in them – except 2042. What if he and his voice lines was originally part of an actual campaign that got scrapped to make the game less attractive? The actor voicing him (I sadly keep forgetting his name) was kind of high profile, so probably too expensive to rerecord, plus there was more marketing material already created for him. His darker tone doesn't fit in the lighthearted mood of the others, but nobody cared anyway.

Did I forget something? Oh, right! Have you heard? There's an independent studio developing a Battlefield Mobile. Just these days – basically the moment we learned about another content delay for 2042 – there were suddenly gameplay screenshots and videos of the upcoming Battlefield Mobile. all around. Was this coincidence? Were the BF2042 fails the reason for someone to release that stuff? Or was it the other way around, BF2042 failing even more to draw the fanbase attention to the mobile title?

So what might have happened?

Some time earlier this year, some execs decided that prospects for BF Mobile would possibly be far better than BF 2042. But why would anyone in the core audience on PC and consoles bothering with clunky mobile controls and mobile monetization? Some might even play the full game on mobile using cloud gaming services. But then someone might have had that dumb idea: What if the main line BF game would fail so hard that fans would flock to that new mobile spin-off with the far better (at least for EA) business model? Wouldn't it be great? Pretty much all Battlefield games had their own launch issues with unique problems. They all have been fixed over time. The fan-base knows that. So a rough launch wouldn't be enough to make the mobile game more interesting. But what if the game would be a total flop? Of course this would be a waste of money, but if you compare these costs to the amounts of money mobile games rake in? I mean, it's clearly a stretch, but one can't deny this whole idea, especially considering how obviously broken and unfinished this game released.

It kind of smells fishy overall, doesn't it? What do you think? Do I believe it? I don't want to, but there are at least a few indicators pointing that direction and just the possibility of coming up with this is kind of sad.

And what about other games? Heard of the Titanfall series and its far more successful spin-off Apex Legends? Just a few weeks ago, Titanfall 1 was basically sunset. Titanfall 2 is still unpatched, broken. And instead of fixing Titanfall 2 (or even 1 and keeping it online), all they do is adding new game modes to Apex Legends that are rather similar to Titanfall to possibly get that fanbase even more interested? Do I see a pattern here?

Oh, and EA said they're committed to rework this game, because Dice is good at this? Yes? Just like Dice is good at producing good Battlefield games in the first place? Hm… But why not drop the ball if the game is losing money and meant to fail? Simple: Retention! Battlefield Mobile isn't ready. If they drop support for BF2042 now, fans will be disappointed, they'll look for another game to play, and they can't look into Battlefield Mobile yet! BF2042 content delayed till summer? Just to keep people loosely connected to the franchise, expecting news. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear more from BF Mobile right before another bomb hitting 2042…

But well, that's all I wanted to write down for now.

**Remember: This is all pure speculation, obviously.**

This isn't meant to cause even more unrest or farm Karma or whatever, but I really wanted to throw down my words, because this is something that's been bugging me all evening now.

And please don't forget: Don't harass any devs, CMs, mods, etc. It's out of their hands and decided far above their heads anyway, whether this is all true or not at all.

But really: What do you think? If you think alike, let me know. If you object, write it down. I absolutely hope I'm totally wrong with this, time might tell some day.

The big ones for me are: Command and Conquer. Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 were easily two of my most childhood defining games. And Battlefield. I played Battlefield since 1942, though I could only play it on my dad's PC. Then BF2 was a huge game for me and my friends. Now it looks as though EA has royally fucked the series with 2042 to the point where I can see the future being in question when taken in combination with BFV. Even though I think BFV was a very decent game, it was almost certainly a commercial failure by EA's idiotic standards of every game needing to generate the GDP of a country. I've only played the beta of 2042, but that was more than enough for me to realize it's a hot turd. Populous: The Beginning was also a big game for me as a kid, a franchise that just kind of faded away with so many, and Sim City, whose brutal murder I think has been somewhat forgotten today.

It seems like there's definitely something going on since EA's game pass is included with Microsoft's. I'm just to the point now where I hate that company so fucking much I'm rooting for a step towards monopoly at least in the PC space, or at least oligopoly. Which unfortunately does have a big impact on indie devs. It's not helped that Valve has also become insanely complacent, with their one major non-VR release being a card game that failed miserably, and their attention mostly being focused on developing VR hardware, which is still very niche.",1644448496.0

sop2cq,Speak with your money!,8,0.79,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sop2cq/speak_with_your_money/,3,"TL;DR Please don't allow gaming companies to force pay to win upon all of us with no consequence and maybe even consider ""missing out"" on a game to let them know what's not ok to do when it comes to these predatory practices before completely ruin our pastime.

&#x200B;

Look, Idk about the rest of this community of gamers, but I'm tired of pay to win.  

Wanna go free to play and charge for cosmetics, MORE POWER TO YA! 

Wanna go free to play and divide modes for the ""no money spent"" crowd (at least not for competitive advantage) and the pay to win crowd, that's AT LEAST an ok compromise (even though they're not ""FREE TO PLAY"" this is where I'd love to see all the sports games go with their ultimate teams, which they never will without government intervention).

HOWEVER, when it's just, hey, we have a F2P game, and here's t the deal....pay us, and you 

a) play early (competitive advantage if the game has ANY pvp, because you gain in game spoils sooner AND have a head start on the game's learning curve)

b) depending on HOW MUCH you pay, you get more to hoist you right along the way.

TWO GAMES that I REALLY wanted to play recently that I haven't touched or decided to learn that much about due to the fact that they've decided that those who pay will have that big leg up were

Pokemon Unite and now, Lost Ark (here in the Western launch).

I don't feel good about buying in game currency, xp, etc...(and the whole preying on people's FOMO is genius business, but feels scummy as hell from a consumer's perspective imo...just let everyone play).

So, I miss out on the fun of these games, but I feel a lot of us are just saying, ""screw it!""

Yeah, make your own choices, and if it's worth it to you to pay to win, go for it...however, recognize the slippery slope that our choices are buying.  Pay scales for access to pieces of games that are just created, then withheld are becoming the NORM rather than something we as gamers/consumers say ""nah, we're not ok with this crap"".

Fighting games are dropping DLC ONE WEEK AFTER LAUNCH!!!!!  That's just giving you 6 slices of pizza and saying, ""We'll let you buy the last two at a premium price tag!  Isn't this great""

IMO, no, not great.  So, I'm asking my fellow gamer to consider the consequences to those among us with less disposable income now AND the consequences to those of us who are just not willing to be ripped off on principle alone now or in the future.

These consequences as I see them are that a good chunk of our hobby is being RUINED, straight up.

One of the reasons I think League of Legends is so popular is that we DON'T have the option (anymore, see runes, if minor) to simply buy victory.  Say what you will about buying champions with real money or in game currency, but I find that when they're not literally selling gold to buff your character mid game, they're doing something right.

Similarly, Path of Exile's biggest sin is probably charging for inventory space, which imo is still a smaller version of p2w.  However, that's one I've compromised on after getting value I deemed above and beyond the 0 dollars and 0 cents I was supporting them with, and I felt almost compelled to buy some stash space as a thanks for the entertainment I once (and still sometimes return to) got from the game.

Just some food for thought, and I KNOW this has been said a million times, but I think we need to tell devs what we WILL and WILL NOT accept when it comes to paying our hard earned money for our hobby and put our foot down if we think they've gone too far (which in business, is really a line drawn in an imaginary tug of war that comes down to how far WE LET them pull us before tugging back).

Good day gamers!",1644443701.0

One thing I’ve really enjoyed is playing those games where your levels don’t really matter but the gear you equip or make does.

Think of a game like dark souls, you can equip lots of different gear that gives you different stats but a high level character will most likely beat a low level one. Same rule for Pokémon. Even a level 100 caterpie could beat a level 1 charmander.

Then you have a game like Monster Hunter. There’s no real levelling system exactly, but depending on what gear you equip you can be more efficient prepared for a situation. And two characters at different points can be equal in “strength “ depending on how they equipped themselves.

There’s just something about the ide of me winning a battle or beating another player not because I was over leveled, but because I worked to make a better system of equipment than they did. 

What are your thoughts on these two methods, which would you prefer?",1644442012.0

These games all do different things with the formula and design that Dark Souls put forward. They're all uniquely built, and have their own mechanics and aesthetic to them that sets them apart.

Lords of the Fallen has a magic class and customizable gauntlet that allows difference in playstyle, making hybrid faith builds work wonders, and with it's strict enemy designs and weapon types, it feels strictly balanced toward using all elements creatively as opposed to relying on one over others. Mono-type players will struggle here unfortunately, but once you figure out what the game expects from the enemy designs and gameplay limitations work well together. It even has a very colorful Diablo-esque aesthetic.

The Surge uses a part targeting system for loot aquisition, as well as vertical and horizontal attacks instead of light and heavy. You attack and sever the part of gear you want, simple as that. It makes farming a breeze and a ton more fun than what Souls offers. You can even bank scrap so you don't lose it when you die. Very convenient if you're afflicted with the curse of serial death like i am.

Code Vein offers a AI partner and coop system, as well as interchangeable classes called Blood Codes, which can be changed on the fly. It also has weapon/armor hybrids called Blood Veils, and specials attacks called Gifts, unique to each Code. The magic stat here is called Ichor, which is refilled by attacking, blocking and using the Veil as a parry, backstab or combo finisher. Veils can also be charged for a drain attack for more Ichor. This game also has a focus stat that increases when hit, allowing you to poise through attacks and launch enemies when full. Certain passive gifts are even activated by this stat as well as make it build faster.

Nioh plays alot more like an action hack n slash than a normal Soulslike, but the usual tactics can still apply to a degree. As you attack, you can use a Ki Pulse to recover a portion of spent stamina, and this spent stamina and ki pulse change bases on one of the three stances you can have equipped. One is for blocking, one is for speed, and the other is for damage, and each affect you differently as well as your rolls and iframes. 

These games are special to me because they represent whay can be done to take a formula and expand it into something new and refreshing. I'm thankful i got to play these in my lifetime, because this is the kind of creativity i want to see even more of in this industry.",1644440653.0

As someone fond of Destiny 2, I get a ton out of the battle pass/seasonal system. I fully expect to earn all the rewards and experience as much of the content I want with it. I evade the FOMO simply because I play enough to know what I want and don't want, and can get what I want. 

But because I like destiny and *want* to get everything out of the game, it takes up my evergreen game slot. I know that if I am (and I am) going to play destiny enough to play through that pass, I'm not going to be able to get the most out of other pass games. 

Warzone and call of duty? Dead by daylight? Halo? Knockout city? Sea of Thieves? Those are games I do like playing, but *knowing* I'm not going to get all the things the game is offering just takes a bit of the wind out of my sails when I hover over that play button. 

But of course, if any of those are your evergreen game that you come back to, you're feeling good about earning all that content. 

It benefits players that really choose to play the game, benefit$ the dev$, and catches some people through fomo at the cost of pushing people away through fomo.

Do you think we'll transition into new prominent models for content, as we have in the past through DLC and look boxes (which aren't nonexistent but aren't the major trend imo) or do you think these battlepass systems have a long time left?",1644434258.0

Everything I have I've either beaten, quit due to toxicity (cough R6 cough) or the ending got spoiled (what are the fucking chances someone is still posting the ending to Fallout 4 and Dying Light in 2022). I just don't have anything to play rn, and it makes me sad cause I do really fucking enjoy video games, but I have no drive to play them rn. 

 My favorite games so far are both Portals, Detroit Become Human, and Titanfall 2 (the campaign, as soon as I bought the game the servers went down, so I got like 2 or 3 online matches in before it broke. fun as hell while it lasted). 

My main and pretty much only issue with all 3 of those games is how little time they took. I beat both portals in 2 days, beat the Titanfall 2 campaign in like 5 hours, and finished Detroit in 2. I've played all 3 of these in the past year, and each one actually made me excited to get home from school and hop on the same way they did as a kid. Just trying to find that again.

So I'm looking for story games that will last me longer than a day. I know I mentioned Dying Light and Fallout 4, and again fucking TikTok spoiled both game's endings, so I'm not really as into playing them anymore. Probably still gonna finish Fallout tho since it's fucking great so far. But I want a game that I can feel attached to the characters, something where I'm genuinely into it. I don't really care about graphics or age, recommend as far back as you like cause I probably haven't played it (strict parents are fun). Idk if this is too much to ask or not, but any and all help is welcome. Also, any game in general too I guess, doesn't have to be a story game, I've just had the best experience with story games so far. Thanks!",1644420416.0

I mean like features that let you immerse better into the world and simply take in the ambiance. Where your character can just build a zone to relax, sit down, sleep, eat, drink and just taking the time in that world before heading out to more adventures and fights. Most games are rushing from one point to the next or the one that do offer similar features are simply lowered down like they let your character rest but you are stuck in some sort of menu to do other things like watching over your character's skill and so on which is of course nice but once you done it you done it and then you wanna leave that menu but can't chill around. This is why I appreciate walking feature so much in games where the character is usually on the run to remind you to relax from time to time.

They got the actors behind Pablo, Kelly, Shelly, Scott, to lend their voices to their movie and show roles 


There will be no story mode for the game, Tim Wilitis who worked with ID for many years on the Quake Franchise, Doom, Rage and now runs Saber interactive has stated in an interview that there will be a few single player missions, and offline multiplayer being playable with A.I. bots but the main focus of the game is asymmetrical multiplayer with PVP/PVE gameplay. 


The S-Mart, Army Of Darkness Medievel Armor Ash, and Evil Dead 1 Ash skins are locked behind preorder dlc and not unlockable in the main game. 


The ""Collectors edition"" which comes with a replica Necromicon Ex Mortis, Vinyl Soundtrack, hardcover art book, dlc codes for a Savini designed ash skin, army of darkness knight outfit, Evil dead 1 ash skin, s-Mart uniform skin, has already been sold out due to scalpers getting their hands on the preorders too. 


It's a PVP/PVE focused experience where 4 players will work together to stop the Deadites from causing chaos in the multiplayer maps available, with each character a different class, while one player gets to play as a Kandarian demon using the environment, deadites, and eventually be able to possess players. 


The car is somewhat useable in cutscenes and traveling to certain areas of the map when needed. 


It will be on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X, PS5 and Nintendo switch. 


I can expect people to be trolls as any asymmetrical multiplayer experience by spawn killing, team killing, cheating with hacked bots, ruining the game for all of the people that play it. 


Bruce says this is the definitive evil dead experience in the interview with Geoff Keighly, and Tim Wilitis but I don't think it is to be honest. I don't think a lot of the Evil Dead fanbase was asking for a multiplayer PvP and PVE style experience from the franchise.",1644412898.0

No real objective at all, do what you want and no need to have a map with 800 side missions that have no meaning at all. SotC is a bit more linear but it doesn't feel that way due to the vast open world map it has. 

Lately there has been a tendency with open-world games where there's a minimap and 200 side quests that you don't need to do but are ""forced"" on the screen. Far Cry 3 was the first game in this category that I played and I enjoyed it, but I also think it's the last one of its kind I've finished. I tried playing The Witcher 3 and I ended up quitting because the amount of things that were happening on the map gave me anxiety and the experience ended up being frustrating instead of enjoyable.

The games in the Dragon Quest series (well, VIII and XI, the ones I've played) also do this very well IMO. There are side quests but they are much less in quantity and really feel ""optional"". They aren't forced to the player.

Me and my wife just happen to have 2 gaming pcs, 2 Nintendo Switches, and a big TV that we wanna hook the devices using an HDMI switch that splits the signal the same way a split-screen would work.

We are planning to put use to them and play all the good online coop games, where we can complete a campaign together, similar to that of halo or nobody saves the world.

We are aware of Nucleuscoop, eventually, that was what we were looking for but since not all games are supported we started making a list of online coop games.

So what is in your opinion are the must-haves for such a setup, please feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments.

Sorry if that already has been posted, just link me to the post and I shall delete the post.

I dunno, it's just something about the idea of mankind messing around with their own biology that appeals to me. Those that I know of that go deep into this are Space Marines from Warhammer 40k and Spartans from Halo. Technically, the details of those are in the books, but since they're also in videogame format and there are a lot of super soldiers that I'm not aware of in videogames, I thought this might be an appropriate place to ask.

There are some details on Cyberware from the Shadowrun franchise, but they don't go in-depth with that. The Starcraft books talk about the difference between Ghosts and Spectres, but those are mostly differences in training and the latter having exposure to Terrazine. No details on whether or not these individuals have undergone any body mods. And I don't know if there are any comics out there that talk about what exactly the Super Soldier Serum in Marvel does outside of ""This sauce makes you awesome"".

XCOM EW has the Gene and Mech Troopers, but they don't go deep enough to tickle my fancy. The Mass Effect games have lore pertaining to biotics and implants, but iirc it's only really limited to biotics.

It looks good, it feels good, and the overall quality of the game is pretty high. Sure, you can see where some of the element's kind of remind you of a gacha style game, but it's not pushing anything on you, and I've certainly not run into anything that would make me feel like I need to purchase anything beyond the base game that I've already paid for. Though I have to say, the game does sort of make you feel like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, especially considering the limited success, and circumstances of New World. Its like, ""okay, this is a good game and all and I'm having fun, but where's the big nasty reveal,"" but so far, that hasn't happened. My only concerns thus far are these:

Currently, all of the content I've cleared has been fairly easy, and nothing has been particularly challenging, even solo dungeoning stuff. So I am worried/interested to see how they handle that in more of the end game content.

Second, there are a lot of currencies in this game, between rapport and silver and gold and everything else, so that becoming a heavy focus for cash grab, and being a potential avenue for abuse is a concern. But obviously that's a ""take it as it comes"" kind of situation.

Overall though...its not bad. The style of game is not for everyone, and the combat system is not as...sticky? as maybe I'd like it to be. It's pretty easy to lose target focus on enemies when there's lots of trash mobs, so that can be a bit frustrating. And obviously having a lot of your abilities being directionally controlled by cursor takes some getting used to. But honestly, those are minor complaints.

All in all, time will tell if this game will live up to expectations in the long run. But as of right now, it seems to be what was promised. Which, I have to say, given the way games have been being released for the last several years now, is fucking refreshing.",1644389615.0

PS4 I play almost exclusives on as well and whatever last gen game I can because its the only machine that runs them. 

I saw my homie scroll through some titles on his Series X with gamepass like it was Netflix, and he always has titles he's playing and loves the value he gets from it. I'm enamored by the idea and generally play lots of different games, so I'm considering picking up the S for the value w/ gamepass.

On to the post.

Everyone's favorite video to complain about in Halo Infinite:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof\_desync\_is\_the\_games\_fault\_less\_than\_10\_ping/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof_desync_is_the_games_fault_less_than_10_ping/)

Do you guys realize how many of those shots missed? It's not as obvious that it's a desync issue as it seems. Some shots hit the shoulder, some go over the shoulder, one of those bursts to the head at the end miss to the left. Intuitively, it looks despicably bad, but it's not as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

I think it may be a negative halo effect (no pun intended) of hearing about it, then when people who aren't as familiar with the gameplay mechanics play the game, it's automatically blamed on desync. Some of the videos I've seen clearly have nothing to do with desync, which I can only assume is blamed on that for the lack of understanding of how the game works, plus the primer of assuming desync is such an issue. For example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo\_infinites\_desync\_issue\_in\_a\_nutshell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo_infinites_desync_issue_in_a_nutshell/)

Or this one, which is lag, not desync:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my\_worst\_desync\_so\_far/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my_worst_desync_so_far/)

I've personally never noticed anything out of the ordinary in Halo Infinite. In every game from COD to Halo, you sometimes wonder how tf you didn't get that kill. There's a lot of adrenaline and sometimes you just feel like it should've been a kill, but 95/100 times it's explainable outside of desync.

And that's all I've got to say about that. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

In honor of those that aren't just jumping to conclusions, here are some videos I found that *are* actually desync:
