The Patent Cazeline Oil, safe, economical, and brilliant … possesses all the requisites which have so long been desired as a means of powerful artificial light.[10]

This is the earliest occurrence of the word to have been found. Cassell discovered that a shopkeeper in Dublin named Samuel Boyd was selling counterfeit cazeline and wrote to him to ask him to stop. Boyd did not reply and changed every ‘C’ into a ‘G’, thus coining the word ""gazeline"".[10] The Oxford English Dictionary dates its first recorded use to 1863 when it was spelled ""gasolene"".

gasoline (n.)

""light, volatile liquid obtained from distillation of petroleum,"" 1864, a variant of gasolene (from 1863 in Britain), which apparently was a trade name at first, from gas (n.1) in its then-popular loose sense of ""compound of gases used for illuminating and heating purposes;"" the -ol probably here represents Latin oleum ""oil"" and the ending is from the chemical suffix -ine (2). Shortened form gas was in common use in U.S. by 1897. Gas station as a fuel filling station for automobiles recorded by 1924.

Entries linking to gasoline

gas (n.1)

1650s, from Dutch gas, probably from Greek khaos ""empty space"" (see chaos). The sound of Dutch ""g"" is roughly equivalent to that of Greek ""kh."" First used by Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont (1577-1644), probably influenced by Paracelsus, who used khaos in an occult sense of ""proper elements of spirits"" or ""ultra-rarified water,"" which was van Helmont's definition of gas.

Hunc spiritum, incognitum hactenus, novo nomine gas voco (""This vapor, hitherto unknown, I call by a new name, 'gas.'"") [Helmont, Ortus Medicinae]

Modern scientific sense began 1779, with later secondary specialization to ""combustible mix of vapors"" (1794, originally coal gas); ""anesthetic"" (1894, originally nitrous oxide); and ""poison gas"" (1900). Meaning ""intestinal vapors"" is from 1882. ""The success of this artificial word is unique"" [Weekley]. Slang sense of ""empty talk"" is from 1847; slang meaning ""something exciting or excellent"" first attested 1953, from earlier hepster slang gasser in the same sense (1944). Gas also meant ""fun, a joke"" in Anglo-Irish and was used so by Joyce (1914). Gas-works is by 1817. Gas-oven is from 1851 as a kitchen appliance; gas-stove from 1848.

-ol 

word-forming element in chemistry, variously representing alcohol, phenol, or in some cases Latin oleum ""oil"" (see oil (n.)).

-ine

gas-guzzler

gasohol

I know people that have spent 3-4x their approved limit on hotel rooms and flights, so like $2500/flight and $700/night, and did this 5 or 6 times before they were even reprimanded, and when they were, countered that they could not have made the trip otherwise, and kept doing it until their corporate card was cut off, and then they certainly never had to pay it back or anything.

t78e5f,hzgzqdn,t3_t78e5f,"First off, your coworker is an idiot. 

I tip 20-30% depending on how good the service is (15% happens sometimes but is rare, that is for terrible service, I think I've tipped 0% once in my life for the worst service experience, they werent having a bad day, they were just a garbage human being). 

The company gives you a $50 food budget (likely doesn't align with the respective region for proper per diem calculation, but that's a separate discussion). You get up to $50 as a budget, period, which covers appetizers, entree, drink, dessert, and anything else you're buying at the restaurant (I'd argue as far as merchandise, it's up to $50, merch like a brewery not Shenanigans). Since they don't look at anything under $50 that's your money to spend... you're likely (legally, at a state level -every state is different-) entitled to somewhere around $50-75 per meal in the USA. If it's a legal discussion, you could straight up pocket the per diem money if it's paid out that way. At one company i worked at, they calculated the GSA rate and cut me a check, I'd spend some and pocket the rest if there was any (sometimes i spent more than per diem on booze alone, so then i was out-of-pocket). But they likely just don't care up to $50 because that's about how much you might spend on a meal, a drink, plus tip. Larger companies I've worked at, more normal, just provide credit cards and track expenses with little hassle. 

If you're traveling more than 12 hours in a trip and 50 miles from home, you qualify for 3/4 per diem, but most business travel on the west coast is overnight (being more spread out than the east coast) so travelers typically qualify for 100%. Here's a link to GSA per diem rates by state/city.

t6mjim,hzd7uf8,t3_t6mjim,"Oh just remembered how my Aunt did this. She was car-jacked and forced to drive to her bank. This was before branch banking in Texas. So her bank was actually in a small town outside of Houston. The kidnapper made her go through the drive-thru and withdraw money. Now my Uncle was a home builder and it wasn't unusual for my Aunt to go through the drive-thru and withdraw large sums of money with different workers in the car. She would then go to the supplier and pay cash on the barrel head. The workers were there because Uncle didn't want her carry large sums of money alone.

Luckily this was a small town bank - and they knew my Aunt. She goes through the commercial line and has a conversation with the teller. In that conversation - she calls all three of her girls by their formal you are in trouble names - not the nickname they go by. My Uncle's legal name is usually a nickname -she referred to him by the formal version that isn't his name. She asks after the teller's family switching their names around. The teller gets the manager, who Aunt knows very well. She calls him by the wrong name. They tell her it will take a minute could she pull up in front of the bank and they will bring the cash out to her. They were actually calling the cops. 

Meanwhile, the kidnapper is getting nervous and careless. Aunt knocks the gun out of his hand - jumps out and runs to the door. They slam the door shut and set off all the alarms. Cops come and the bad guy is caught.

After everything was over and the cops were gone, my Uncle walks into the bank. They rush over to tell him my Aunt is ok - and of course, he didn't know anything about it because cell phones were decades in the future.

Dean is kidnapped and held hostage. When his kidnappers call his brother Sam, Dean remarks that he's in a place, and describes it as a, ""funky town"". That statement was a code for someone having a gun on him.

What would be ideal is you working with someone close to you to develop innocuous words or statements to mean certain things. Such as, ""I'm heading to a different place to start anew"". ""Anew"" could be your key word for your being forced into a situation you're not able to get out of.

Or, write that you're, ""traveling to somewhere different"". ""Different"" can be code for you being forcibly confined.

A whale is an obsessive person who spends large amount of money, often to the tune of hundreds of dollars a month, on ""free to play"" games.  Legitimate free to play games try to get everyone to buy some cheap goodies and are fine with the players they lose money on as long as they make money from the whales and from the small stuff.

Companies like the ones you talk about purposely want as many whales as possible and want to get rid of all the players who aren't whales.

They aren't making a game. They are making a machine to suck money out of addicts. They do not care if anyone likes their game. The addicts can all hate it as far as they are concerned, as long as they stay addicted.

These ads act as a sort of test. The people who are easily addicted will get sucked in even though the game has nothing to do with the ads that brought them. Non whales like you will bounce away, leaving them free to suck the addicts dry.

Substance use disorders span a wide variety of problems arising from substance use, and cover 11 different criteria:

-Taking the substance in larger amounts or for longer than you're meant to.

-Wanting to cut down or stop using the substance but not managing to.

-Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from use of the substance.

-Cravings and urges to use the substance.

-Not managing to do what you should at work, home, or school because of substance use.

-Continuing to use, even when it causes problems in relationships.

-Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of substance use.

-Using substances again and again, even when it puts you in danger.

-Continuing to use, even when you know you have a physical or psychological problem that could have been caused or made worse by the substance.

-Needing more of the substance to get the effect you want (tolerance).

-Development of withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance.

In this article, they say:

*Two drinks a day may be safe, but only for the average man. ""Two drinks a day is an average distributed across the population,"" Dr. Mukamal says. ""There are inevitably going to be people in that population for whom that is not true.""*

and

*For example, some research has found that people who limit alcohol to between two and six standard drinks per week have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than people who drink more. That averages out to less than a drink a day. In fact, the American Geriatrics Society suggests that people over 65—both men and women—should limit themselves to one daily drink. Two drinks a day might cancel the benefit, but still do no major harm.*

**You are drinking SEVEN TIMES that much. So, it's clearly unhealthy.**

So, having perspective can help.

Also, cherish the self-awareness that brought you here. This is precisely the deeper examination of your shadow psychology that might save you in the end- a willingness to look at yourself critically.

t6hfhs,hzd0nqn,t3_t6hfhs,So I'm an RN and somewhat of an alcoholic.  The thing about drinking alcohol is that it inhibits the absorption of key nutrients like thiamine and folic acid in the small bowel and the effect can last for longer than the alcohol is in your body.  So if you're drinking 2 beers or 6 beers every single day you're going to be chronically deficient of these nutrients and they are necessary for your neurological health.  Over time people can develop ataxia (difficulty walking) and something called wernicke's encephalopathy which is like dementia.  6 day is too much.  2 a day is considered heavy drinking.  To make sure you're getting at least some more optimal nutrient absorption you should try to take one or two days off a week.  I have cut back all the way to just once a week.

t6m7w2,hzcys7i,t3_t6m7w2,"You make some good points, and I think there’s room in the world for both groups, but we need to look at our meat production and consumption and perhaps make some changes.

I’m the granddaughter of a farmer with a small dairy business.  He was never going to be wealthy, but even though we were incredibly poor, we always had fresh milk, fresh eggs, chicken meat when available, and lots of beef when it was necessary to kill a cow.  I always knew where my meat came from, and it was never styrofoam packages with plastic from the grocery store.  I remember being around my parents and aunts and uncles on “slaughter day” and they would use butcher paper to wrap cuts of meat and share the animal.

But even with this abundance, we *never* ate as much meat as people seem to eat today.  We might have a big pot roast on Sunday and macaroni, left over beef and tomato sauce on Monday, and ***maybe*** roast beef sandwiches and soup on Tuesday.  But the amount of meat each person got was somewhere between 2-4 ounces; it was understood that this had to last.

Now that I live far away from the farm, in another state, I still cook about 3-5 ounces of meat as a serving, and if it’s larger than that, we save some for sandwiches.  And we don’t have meat every day, about 3-4 days a week I cook a vegan or vegetarian meal.

So I think what you are suggesting is to go back to farming and meat production of a long time ago:  smaller farms, not owned by huge conglomerates whose only concern is making profit.  If the farmer owned the land and had more control over the selling of his product, I think there would be more concern for the environment, rotating crops so no piece of land is depleted, being concerned about the quality of the meat and animal run off, especially if that was *your* creek, *your* water.

This is actually something I’m seeing at the farmers market.  There aren’t just fruit and vegetable vendors, there are also meat producers, bringing their small batch meats for sale.  I recently bought pork chops from one vendor, and the minute I opened the package I could tell these were different; there was no telltale smell of meat/blood.  It was just clean.  My husband said they were the best pork chops since he was a kid…also a child of a family farmer.

First of all, we will just have less cows. There are way more cows that we need and most of them get killed and re-bred in a way too short cycle. For example, there are more cows in Argentina than humans. So if we go vegan, the amount of cows will decrease immensely.

Second of all, cows need so much land space. We have around 5ha green land for 20 cows. It’s not because they need the space, more that they need to get good, fresh and nutritious grass. Imagine how much more people you can feed with 5ha of corn or weed instead of 20 cows.

Last but not least, the farmers are already dying and in my country in Central Europe, most of them are living from grants now. Even though you can remove all the expensive equipment like milking machines, huge amounts of coverage where they can sleep and eat and also all grass-related machines, farmers would bleed even more.

Anyways, one of the issues with this argument is that the land used for pastures isn't the same as the land used for crops

Not all land is fertile enough to be effective crop land. Even in the US, only some 23% of the land available has fertile soil, and it was snatched up long ago

t6m7w2,hze9zav,t3_t6m7w2,"The problem isnt the animals or the land. It's the practices and the way certain things are handled.

For example, there is land that is better suited to animals. There is also land that is better suited to crops. There are places where they do one instead of the other because of profit margins.

As an example, some places are growing avocados in the desert.

Brazil is burning down rainforest for cattle ranches.

Animal feed is often cheap mass produced corn which causes the gut flora in cows to make methane (which is the greenhouse gass emissions issue) but that all but dissappears when cattle are grass fed.

Modern crop fertilizers are made out of petroleum.

The problem isn't eating meat or vegetables, it's how they're produced and whether that makes sense in the local ecosystem. We'd be much better off if the crops in the US were grown along the Mississippi river and not in the shadow of the rocky mountains, for example, as that's better off being buffalo ranches and such. Instead they're depleting a massive aquifer to keep the farms there.

Veganism generally is more of an emotional feel-good solution than a practical one. Not least because crops have to be protected from everything, from bugs to birds to squirrels and rabbits and operate separately from the natural ecosystem.

Pastures traditionally don't have good enough soil to be used as farmlands so what would happen is simply that they'd slowly turn into forests. This is true for what I'll refer to ass meadows too. idk if meadows is the correct word but fields where the soil is too poor to plant actual crops but you use them to harvest animal feed in forms of tall grass, these places hold a lot of different flowers and therefore insects. This is already a problem in my country that we are losing a lot of biodiversity because of the decline in certain types of pastures and in meadows. This has lead to near extinction of a whole lot of bees/insects but also bigger animals like hens and certain rodents thrive in these types of tall grasses. 

Further in the days of old there used to be different kinds of meadows and pastures because certain years it was raining, certain Years were cold and yet others were hot and dry. Since having your livestock survive was absolutely vital you kept non-optimal meadows/pastures. You tried to have a blend so you always had some place that could give you enough food for your animals. This meant stuff like keeping swamplike meadows for the dry years, keeping sandy burned out meadows for the wet years and keeping ""leaf meadows"" which were places were you could gather leaves and use for animal feed. The same went for pastures.

Nowadays since keeping animals is not a matter of survival but rather an economic one the ""insurance"" type of meadows and pastures are no longer used.

On top of that, a little forewarning can go a long way towards meaning they can read ahead after all. Think back to a movie you've seen with a major plot twist that got spoiled for you - when you watched it, the ""big surprise"" just didn't cause quite as strong an emotional response as it might have otherwise did it? By knowing that there's a potentially triggering moment in a piece of media you can also self assess beforehand whether or not you're mentally up to engaging with it. Not everyone who has say a domestic violence trigger needs to completely avoid media that includes domestic violence, but if they know there's an intense DV scene in a movie they're otherwise interested in they might choose to put off watching it until they feel like they have the mental resilience to do so.

Finally, there are apps and add-ons that allow people to filter out specific terms, but a post about sexual assault might not necessarily include the specific words ""sexual assault"" and as such might slip through the filter.

An example would be me in high school. I discovered late all the things I would’ve been ambitious about. I wasted so much time, but I passed somewhat because I was gifted and I balanced what was more important to me.

If I’m being honest, I really fucking hate to work. Swear to god , it’s repetitive and boring and even worse when the workplace your at has no one your age. Was a lot better when my best friend worked with me.

I still dipped into my ambitions slightly, like I never studied hard or did whatever 4.0 freaks did. But I attended a college prep workshop in high school that gave you ideas on learning what and how it all works and such (loans, scholarships, etc.) And one guy who was sitting behind me spoke and said “would you rather work 50 hours at a job to earn $500 or work on an essay for 5 hours to earn $500” that stuck in my head my junior year and it wasn’t till the last 3 months of my senior year I started applying. I had over 200 absences in school (covid bypass). I’ve earned over 30k in scholarships in those 3 months and honestly I did put the work in, but a lot of luck was factored into it.


I guess in the perspective of you a 36 year old man. What do you value the most? Maybe just put a little effort into it if you really want it.

Explanation if what I make doesn’t make sense: I really hate working, but I wanted to go to college so I applied and did what I needed to do to avoid that. 

All while slacking off and doing what I want. 

Honestly though your life sounds like a vibe. But if developing relationships is something you wanted (hypothetically). Then I would probably maybe do research and figure out how you would want to do that.

I do think it is a rather upsetting issue though... I'd prefer if Americans got their kids used a more healthy ""adult"" diet at a younger age.

I remember seeing an episode of Anthony Bourdain's TV show like 5 years ago where he was in France and the school lunch worker had made the children a pumpkin soup and some other healthy and high quality food.  In America the lunch food is often frozen bullshit off a truck from a big corporation that tastes rather bland and is high in calories and unhealthy.  (Though many people will be nostalgic about school pizza and chocolate milk and stuff because it was a fun break in their day and a social event... plus often we Americans can enjoy something high in fat or sugar and feel a childhood sense of ""comfort food"")

It is often a ""coming of age"" transition where an American (university/college aged or maybe in their 20s or possibly later) makes a decision to start eating more ""adult"" food that is healthy... like salads, vegetable soups, more water, cutting out soda and candy...

*Remember all those years of fair elections and the peaceful transfer of leadership from one person to the next?? Well, no need to worry about that any more. Thanks to Trump, we can now openly and without any proof whatsoever delay any election result from the national level all the way down to local elections! Isn't that great!! You don't like the results? Accuse the other side of election theft and just wait it out! Cool, right?


*Tired of the US not being the center of everything? Take a page from the Trump playbook and just put yourself right in the middle of anything. Distract from the situation by being directly involved with little to no idea about what's going on. Cool!!


*Speaking of being clueless, Trump has really opened the door on leaders not needing to know anything whatsoever. With the Trump philosophy, you can cite any generic reference to prove your point. Phrases like ""Many people say .."",  ""You can ask anyone..."" or ""Look it up yourself .."" can really put you on top of any discussion.

\- Mai Tai is really nice fruity tiki drink which does not associate with any of girly drinks. Almost all tiki drinks are like this (but some of them can be very potent, even if you don't taste the alco)

\- Vodka and cranberry is pretty good, or a screwdriver (vodka orange), or a salty dog (vodka grapefruit) 

\- Americano is nice, if you like bitter-floral-citrus tastes. It is a version of negroni without the gin 

\- White russian is top tier adult choccy milk type of beat. Its potent, but it has cream and coffee liqueur so its basically spiked creamed coffee. The flavor of alcohol is very mellow. Bonus points for making you look a little retro-sophisticated lol 

Honestly, any type of cocktail made properly will leave the strong alcohol taste out. Unless its something like a martini or an old fashioned, of course (purely spirit based). Also these days in modern bars they do a really impressive jobs of coming up with non-classical sophisticated cocktails based around infusions and such, which also will not taste like alcohol at all",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646390371.0

t690a2,hzcrpag,t3_t690a2,"I've been a bartender in NYC for almost a decade and I work at a very popular, high-volume place where 20-somethings hang out. 

The suggestions you've gotten so far--Amaretto sour, Piña Colada, Arnold Palmer--are all TERRIBLE for your goal of not looking like a basic white girl who can't handle her liquor.

Not only are they SUPER surgery and therefore hangover fuel, when someone orders any one of those from me (and they sure do) my very first assumption is that they're a child who has no idea what they're doing in a bar and/or watches too much TikTok.

Unfortunately, the truth is there isn't really a single drink that doesn't taste like alcohol and won't make you look like a basic white girl, because those two criteria are almost completely incompatible. 

I think the key for you is picking nicer liquor. Quality makes a HUGE difference in how much acerbic raw alcohol you taste, especially in clear liquors. 

I suggest that you order 'tall' [liquor]-sodas: regular shot of liquor plus double the normal amount of seltzer. That's ~2 oz of vodka in ~8 oz of soda water, plus ice and lime. You would have a hard time detecting a strong taste of any alcohol, all of that extra water is good for a long night out, (Remember: a hangover is basically extreme dehydration) and your bartender won't roll their eyes--it's completely legit. 

Let's talk brands. 

I'm assuming you don't want any brown liquor because it is the most alcoholy of all of them, so taking that off the menu...

For tequila, Patron and Casa Migos are a ripoff--you're paying for a brand, not quality. The sweet-spot for price/quality is Espelon, Hornitos, and Herradura. Cazadores if you're feeling fancy.

Vodka, go for mid-tier: Tito's, Ketel One, Skyy, or Stoli. Grey Goose if you wanna spend a little more, but it's often overpriced. 

Gin, I'd say Beefeater, Bombay Sapphire, Gordon's or Blue Coat. Hendricks for a few bucks more.  

Here's how you order: ""Can I please have a tall [insert brand here]-soda with lime?"" If they don't have any of the liquor I've suggested, ask them to just give you whatever is a step or two above the well liquor and the bartender will make a call. 

My real suggestion is this: take yourself out to a cocktail bar on a weeknight and experiment. Get a couple things on the menu and see how you like them. If one strikes you as bearable, keep the base liquor (vodka, gin, mezcal, etc) and see which other cocktails use that liquor. See if you can develop a taste for the alcohol, because that does indeed happen. 

Also, additional tips to look like a pro: pay in cash, space your drinks out with water, be patient, and tip your bartender! You look like a pro when you drop a good tip. The bartender reads that as appreciation of their work, and that matters in any job. Plus tipping big up-front usually guarantees the bartender will be more attentive to you. If I have a full bar, a person who tipped me well is gonna jump a few places in line, versus someone who's stiffed me, who will be the very last person I serve. 

Standard tipping: $1 per mixed-drink/beer, $2-$3 per cocktail if they're shaking something. Throw a few extra bucks if they're attentive, helpful, nice, or fast. Go 20% for a tab over $30.

Good luck!",4,0,0,False,False,False,1646422085.0

Then I learnt about nonbinary identities, and things started to click. “They” just felt right. And after all, we already use “they” to refer to someone who’s gender we don’t know, so it felt more natural for me to use than xenopronouns (not to imply those pronouns are invalid, they just aren’t mine).

According to [congress.gov](https://congress.gov), he was the sponsor on 1,067 bills while a member of congress. 491 of those were introduced, 164 of those received floor consideration, and [28 of them became law](https://www.congress.gov/advanced-search/legislation?congressGroup%5B0%5D=0&congresses%5B0%5D=117&congresses%5B1%5D=116&congresses%5B2%5D=115&congresses%5B3%5D=114&congresses%5B4%5D=113&congresses%5B5%5D=112&congresses%5B6%5D=111&congresses%5B7%5D=110&congresses%5B8%5D=109&congresses%5B9%5D=108&congresses%5B10%5D=107&congresses%5B11%5D=106&congresses%5B12%5D=105&congresses%5B13%5D=104&congresses%5B14%5D=103&congresses%5B15%5D=102&congresses%5B16%5D=101&congresses%5B17%5D=100&congresses%5B18%5D=99&congresses%5B19%5D=98&congresses%5B20%5D=97&congresses%5B21%5D=96&congresses%5B22%5D=95&congresses%5B23%5D=94&congresses%5B24%5D=93&legislationNumbers=&restrictionType=field&restrictionFields%5B0%5D=allBillTitles&restrictionFields%5B1%5D=summary&summaryField=billSummary&enterTerms=&wordVariants=true&legislationTypes%5B0%5D=hr&legislationTypes%5B1%5D=hres&legislationTypes%5B2%5D=hjres&legislationTypes%5B3%5D=hconres&legislationTypes%5B4%5D=hamdt&legislationTypes%5B5%5D=s&legislationTypes%5B6%5D=sres&legislationTypes%5B7%5D=sjres&legislationTypes%5B8%5D=sconres&legislationTypes%5B9%5D=samdt&public=true&private=true&chamber=all&actionTerms=&legislativeActionWordVariants=true&dateOfActionOperator=equal&dateOfActionStartDate=&dateOfActionEndDate=&dateOfActionIsOptions=yesterday&dateOfActionToggle=multi&legislativeAction=Any&sponsorState=One&member=Biden&sponsorTypes%5B0%5D=sponsor&sponsorTypes%5B1%5D=sponsor&sponsorTypeBool=OR&dateOfSponsorshipOperator=equal&dateOfSponsorshipStartDate=&dateOfSponsorshipEndDate=&dateOfSponsorshipIsOptions=yesterday&committeeActivity%5B0%5D=0&committeeActivity%5B1%5D=3&committeeActivity%5B2%5D=11&committeeActivity%5B3%5D=12&committeeActivity%5B4%5D=4&committeeActivity%5B5%5D=2&committeeActivity%5B6%5D=5&committeeActivity%5B7%5D=9&satellite=%5B%5D&search=&submitted=Submitted&q=%7B%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%7D).

- No chance of direct conflict with a superpower. 

- The military capability to do it is actually present. For all of its bluster, the PLA couldn't take Taiwan right now without extremely high casualties. 

- The CCP can't realistically be the political organization launching the war. The command structure of the PLA is completely inadequate and corruption has facilitated the rise of an incompetent officer corps. And, of course, the CCP may not actually want the island anyway since it's far more useful for propaganda than as a prize. 

- If the semiconductor industry were to move to some other place in the world, US interest in defending the island would shrink dramatically. If it can be moved elsewhere, the window of opportunity widens considerably.

So would the CCP try it anyway? Maybe. Depends on what the internal power struggles of the CCP look like. When authoritarian regimes feel they're losing their grip on power, they tend to contemplate ever more desperate measures. Currently the authoritarianism is ramping up in China as Xi gets more and more control so it's not likely he'd risk attempting an invasion any time soon.

What the invasion of Ukraine has shown is that a conflict with an aggressor can be avoided while still destroying its ability to wage war. Russia's economy is going to collapse in short order and China can't risk the same fate for the simple reason that the CCP legitimizes itself to the people by promising prosperity.

A post-HRT trans woman and I would be on far more even footing, but she'd struggle against a pre-HRT trans woman. And that'd also depend on how old people were and how long ago people started HRT. 

Basically hormones are very very strong things, and HRT is a lot more effective than most people think, although it takes around 3 years to reach its full effect because it's a second puberty. So post-HRT trans women don't retain any more muscle mass than cis women, while post-HRT trans men have the same muscle mass as cis men. The only possible sporting advantage that HRT doesn't effect is height: trans women tend to be taller than average, and trans men shorter than average. But bone density, muscle mass, muscle strength, fat and muscle distribution, and how quickly one gains muscle are all controlled by hormones and therefore affected by HRT (which are usually some form of estrogens and testosterone blockers for trans women, and testosterone injections or gels for trans men).

Despite what the trans activists will try to tell you, everyone knows deep down in their heart and soul that men and women are different physiologically, and that it’s not fair for biological men to compete with biological women. This is a well accepted scientific fact that dates back millennia. Only in this new culture of over-the-top sugarcoating and “inclusion” is that being questioned, to the detriment of biological women.

To an extent, we have to realize that the world is not fair, and everyone is dealt a different hand in life. I do feel for and have a lot empathy for people with Gender Identity Disorder, it’s a very challenging condition that can lead to crippling depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations if left untreated. I fully support a trans person’s right to transition, but they cannot expect the rest of their world to bend to their every whim to “affirm their identity”. Trans women and biological woman are both worthy of equal respect, dignity, and courtesy, but we have to acknowledge that they are very different. (Vice versa for trans men and biological men).

Unfortunately, there are just not enough transgender people to really form a trans sports league. Last I checked, they were about 0.6% of the population in the US (just over one-half of one percent). At the same time, we can’t keep pretending like it’s fair to have biological males competing again biological females in varsity athletics. Look at the Penn swimmer Lia Thomas situation - Lia, a trans women who is biologically male, beat the biologically female competition by *38 seconds* in one of the races. That’s an absolutely *massive* advantage, and not even close to fair.

I think the best possible solution is to limit trans people to Junior Varsity (JV) competition. That way they still get the experience of playing and competing in sports, but without taking away from the biological women and girls who have worked so hard to be the best they can at their sports.

Now that's just brutal. It's not feasible to have trans people competing in sports, that's just not sports any longer.



And if it comes down to it, having anything modifying your ability to perform at a certain event, it really just makes it unfair. Hence why doping is banned.



Creating their own league would be interesting to say the least... it would be a lot less popular than paralympics, which also equates to a substantial amount of funding cut. It would never be feasible for anybody to host it besides out of generousity.

Mia Mulder on youtube just released a video essay on this exact topic. Her argument is solid and addresses any concern you may have about trans people in sports. The video title is ""Should Trans Women Be Allowed In Womens Sports?""


For your second question, I'm just gonna say off the bat that the notion that all trans people should have one gender is pretty offensive. Not gonna drag you for it, but just letting you know that some people with a shorter tolerance than I have will reasonably be very upset at you for suggesting that, so I'd refrain from asking in the futute. You can ask me follow-up questions, but dont be shocked if other trans people get mad at you or if I decide to cut off the conversation. This subject is very sensitive for trans people like me.

Trans people aren't just men or women, mtf doesnt mean woman and ftm doesnt mean man. Mtf is just a status label, all it says is ""this person is transitioning from male to female"" and that can mean anything from physical transition with all the bells and whistles or just changing their name and pronouns, you can be any gender identity while being mtf, you can even be a man believe it or not because trans identity is plain complicated. Ftm is the same, just for ""this person is transitioning from female to male."" And those aren't even the only options, there are also transneutral people or m/ftx or m/ftn who are transitioning in a ""neutral"" direction (however the individual defines it).

Nonbinary people do exist, they can be and often are mtf or ftm, and they are just as trans as any trans man or trans woman. Nonbinary genders are vast and most dont even touch the categories of ""man"" or ""woman."" But that doesnt work for all trans people. Trans people should be allowed to use whatever gender labels they feel confortable with, not lumped into one gender box together that they dont get to define for themselves.

Putting trans people as a whole into one gender label is like saying orange, yellow, green, purple, pink, and all their shades are the exact same color, while red and blue (the binary genders) get their own label categories. And that understandably doesn't make sense. To us, ""orange"" is as distinct of a category as ""red."" It's close to red, sure, but we see it as distinct enough from red to warrant it being its own category. It's the same with gender. 

So TLDR: let trans people define themselves. Gender currently functions in a ""you pick or make your label"" fashion, and shoving all trans people, regardless of gender or transitionial direction or any other factor, into one or a few groups essentially stomps out that diversity. That system is just as repressive as saying male and female are the only gender categories. Trans people are the genders they say they are, there shouldn't be desire to force them to compromise on that.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646421276.0

White people absolutely have a culture. I think the intent is to say that mainstream American culture is based on a certain type of coastal white elite culture that is very present in media and that because that's the ""default"" we shouldn't consider it a valid culture in of itself. Or should quarantine spaces and discussion around culture to mean a minority culture. 

Which is dumb. 

For one, there are plenty of white cultures that ARE NOT that default culture. White comes in a lot of flavors. Some that do not easily line up with that template. Different ethnic groups and religions certainly have a distinct cultural edge that can shine through the more immersed people are in them (evangelicals, for instance, or first/second generation immigrants from majority white nations). There are also distinct regional cultures that have display some differences between race (southern black and white culture, for instance, are generally more dissimilar than Midwestern black and white culture). 

But even ignoring that...the default culture IS a culture. Or an imalgimation of them at the very least. Certainly aspects of traditionally black and east Asian culture have taken firm root in the default American culture. 

This ""whites don't have culture"" argument usually comes up when minority groups (not always racial minorities) identify themselves in opposition to the mainstream. I'm Jewish, I'm black, I'm Latina. White people? At least mainstream AMERICAN white people? They just identify as AMERICAN. Or a subgroup there in (Southern, Alaskan, Californian, New Yorker, etc). WE have culture because we're different than that. 

But...saying that's ""not a culture"" is reductive, hurtful and also just kinda not factually true. For all the reasons I just mentioned but also because even if people don't identify their culture using that word...we all have one. We have cultural mores and stories and a history of lived experiences passed down to us that affect our worldview. 

Look. Let's be as generous as possible. Many people who define themselves in this oppositional way (and many people would not unjustifiabley change that wording to *are defined by society*) are protective of spaces that they consider ""theirs"" because they feel like mainstream white people have the rest of the cultural landscape. 

I think this is stupid but...I'm also an old school melting potter. I think that, while we are very far from it, the old, tired ""I don't see color"" is still a pretty good idea to shoot for. Toss everything together and whatever dominant cultural strains rise to the top belong to everybody. But I also recognize that a generation of cultural thought has gone the ""tossed salad"" direction of siloing off different--especially non dominant (except sometimes they are?)--cultures and assigning some kind of ownership of them to that group.

For example, ask a German man what their culture is like, and he'll tell you one thing. Ask an Irish man what his culture is like, and he'll tell you something entirely different from what the German man told you. 

This differs from something like Black culture in America. Black culture is distinct because of how black people came to be in America. To put it simply, because of the slave trade, many Black Americans lost touch with their ancestry and culture that existed in Africa before they were taken to America. Because of this, Black Americans essentially had to undergo a cultural reset that manifested itself in a number of ways throughout American history. The most distinct of these is an innate common understanding of the inherent hardship that comes with being black in America. 

This isn't to imply that white people don't experience hardship as well, they very much do. However, the hardship that white people experience is not often based on an immutable trait that is tied to their very identity. And beyond that, most white people still have relatively strong ties to their ancestry that makes their identity much more distinct than just ""white"" (i.e. German/Irish etc.). 

For most Black Americans, though, many don't really have any connection to their African roots at all anymore. Without that ancestral connection, Black Americans had to turn to each other for kinship as they were constantly surrounded by contempt from most White Americans. Thus, a distinct new culture was formed. Black culture.

t7hdar,hzhnsfd,t3_t7hdar,"The reason that stereotype exists is because Southerners generally live farther away from diverse people than northerners.

When you live isolated or are only in contact with a lot of people that look, act and think like you - your beliefs and practices solidify over time because you were never exposed to anything else. So all you do is repeat what you've already done, solidifying actions and believes.

Northerners - they have denser population areas like cities. Because they're constantly surrounded by others - they can see all different sorts of varieties and whether they consciously or subconsciously mimic of adopt and change what they see.

It's not necessarily more ""laid-back"", beliefs are just not as solidified as they are isolated when exposed to variety. It's a similar reason why those living in the country-side tend to be more conservative than those living in densely populated areas.

It's one reason schools and other institutions are pushing for diversity to help mitigate social stereotypes across social groups like gender and race.

Obviously when these areas and leaders push for diversity at the expense of other things - like test scores - that's where the debate comes in since there is no real quantifiable way to show that diversity in a specific niche will increase quality of life for everyone. Yes, there are research to suggest diversity in the workforce improves productivity (and not just workforce studies) - but that's not a safety net to apply to all regions and areas and all workforces as well which leaves room open for debate.

Anyway - it really is that complicated, and that's why there's debates and arguments all throughout society because nothing is really black and white. You can be isolated but still have an open-mind, it's just general patterns that happen to occur amongst types of people.

Life is too complex to label stereotypes and generalities as ""hard truths"", however some take one portion or partial truth too far and they claim it to be a hard truth when it is not.

I now pay what’s left of the mortgage on the house (started around $80K), utilities, car / car insurance, student loans, everything. 

As a young person with full “adult” responsibilities, it is my opinion that there’s no such thing as an adult. As far as “acting” like one, there’s a level of professionalism you maintain at work and in certain settings (largely with superiors or with coworkers you’re not close to, and of course clients) but that’s it. 

Then you could try to define being an adult by age and / or maturity. Obviously you’re an adult in the eyes of the law at 18 (or whatever age if it’s different where you live), but 18 is hardly an adult to anyone and I find that maturity comes more with life experience than age (they’re correlated because with more time you’re likely to experience more, but they’re not linearly related at all). Maybe being an adult has to do with the freedom you get when you graduate school or move out of your parent’s house, but that on it’s own isn’t usually the case. Your interests certainly don’t define you as an adult either. I have a full time job, but I still come home and play Fortnite and other video games with my girlfriend. I like sex and alcohol sometimes, but I buy Capri Suns every now and then and some of my favorite TV shows are shows I used to watch as a kid (I’ll still be watching Avatar and Regular Show until I’m 80).

Reducing your breathing rate or volume will have no effect on how much oxygen you get in your blood

Oxygen toxicity occurs at concentrations > 60% 02. This concentration can only be delivered by blending pure oxygen with air… like in a hospital.  It’s delivered at this concentration to get the oxygen tension to normal levels. The tension is 5-6 times more than the concentration in healthy lungs, and 8…10…20 times more in diseased lungs. To get the tension to levels compatible with life, the concentration may need to be increased to “toxic” levels… as discussed in COVID. 

(Eg. 21% ambient air yields 100mmHg oxygen tension in healthy lung’s whereas 80% medical oxygen may be needed to get 100mmHg oxygen tension in COVID)

As the hyperoxygenated blood circulates the body it causes injury before the excess is exhaled.  In the disease states where this high concentration of oxygen is delivered, there may not be any excess. (Because of the aforementioned disparity between oxygen concentration and tension, which varies with healthy and diseased lungs… calculable as the A-a Gradient). 

If you’re so clever I don’t know why you didn’t realize that oxygen circulates the body in the blood before the excess is exhaled.  It would be common sense that oxygen toxicity occurs while the oxygen is in the body. 

Less than that 60% and you can get oxidative stress, but it’s not generally toxic.

Here another example more modern and inline with the kids, no mention of gas lamps.

imagine a scenario similar to the following:

Mr. A is sexting with Ms B. Mrs. A walks into the room so Mr. A clears his chat history and closes the app on his phone.

Mrs. A says ""i feeling like you have been cheating on me recently""

Mr. A says ""please can you not constantly accuse me of cheating on you everyday"" 

Mrs. A says ""I swear i saw notifications on your phone coming from a mysterious Ms. B"" 

Mrs. A now feels confused, she asks to check his phone screen and she sees no new notifications from Ms B. 

Mr A carefully manipulates Mrs A so that she begins to doubts there is cheating going on

Mr A receives a new message from Ms B but he doesnt save her number in his phone so it looks like a message from 1-555-567-8901

Mrs A says ""whos that?""

Mr A says ""sorry i dont know the number, may be spam."" And he go to delete the message - together Mr A and Mrs A briefly see a woman sexting sending nudes from the unknown number - but Mr A insists he never knew this woman and it is a spammer. Mr A deleted the messages in front of Mrs A and says ""see i am loyal, i am not cheating.""

Mrs A still feels confused, but seeing Mr A delete messages make her feel at least momentarily reassured that he is faithful, so she leaves the room to go do other things around the house. 

The second she leaves...

Now when Mr. A is alone, he turns back to his phone and he is sexting with Ms B and cheating on his wife Mrs A.

This is gaslighting. 

Mrs A is totally correct Mr A is indeed cheating. Mr A is manipulating Mrs A so that she doesn't even trust her own common sense anymore. Mrs A is the victim, she is made to feel like she got it all wrong... but we know she is the correct person here. Gaslighting implies trying to make someone doubt their own eyes and common sense.

imagine a scenario similar to the following:

Mr. A turns down the gas. 

Mrs. A says ""it cold in here.""

Mr. A says ""please can you turn up the gas like i asked you countless times before"" 

Mrs. A says ""I swear i turned up the gas like 15 minutes ago! It should warm."" 

Mrs. A now feels confused, but she turns up the gas now. 

It takes a while for the home to heat up, so she leaves Mr. A alone to go do other chores around the house... 

Now when Mr. A is alone, he turns the gas back down. And now he is screaming he is mad ""Honey you DIDNT turn up the gas!!!"" 

This is gaslighting. 

Mrs A is being manipulated to believe that she never turns the gas up.
Mr A knows she DID turn it up.
Mrs A knows she turned it up.

Meanwhile Norway is over there watching dubbed versions of Matlock quietly seeing how all this shit could be improved on while America keeps dumping out Red Dawn type movies and pointing at communists and shitting their fucking pants pointing at the Red Dawn type movies as examples of how being able to drive around with a shotgun in your truck's gun rack is the ultimate in freedom and could very well come in handy.

They think the right to have things provided to you by the government for free without having to work for them is freedom. These people would rather give up more individual rights and have the government provide for them. They think this is freedom ,but it is the opposite of freedom. 

To Americans well at least libertarians and right leaning ones, positive liberty is not freedom. It is the opposite of freedom. To us freedom equals individual rights. The right to be free from government interference not the right to have the government provide for you. 

Let’s use the example of universal healthcare. To europeans and American progressives, universal healthcare is more free because it is more affordable and can be easier to get care. However, then you lack choice especially in a single payer system. How is that freedom? Universal healthcare gives the government more power. The government has a right to say who lives or dies. Do you remember Charlie Gard? He was a British baby with a terminal illness. His parents wanted to bring him to the US for experimental treatment but a judge said no and ordered them to pull the plug. This is why conservatives must stop universal healthcare at all costs. Even if it is cheaper, it and other government programs like it which take power away from the private sector and delegate them to the government are the antithesis of freedom. These types of programs make people more dependent on government and take responsibilities and choices away from individuals. How is that freedom? Where europeans see government as an enabler of freedom, many Americans see government as an obstacle to freedom. The duty of the government is to protect your freedom, not provide for you. Our constitutional rights are protected, not granted. 

If you define freedom in this way, then America is the last true beacon of freedom. Most of our European allies have given up their individual rights for the government to provide for them. They have government healthcare, and free education. They pay higher taxes so they have less of a choice of what to do with their own money.

The 2nd Amendment covers the Right to Bear Arms (which has nothing to do with hunting), it was established to give the citizenry the rights and means to to overthrow a repressive or illegitimate government.

t65axt,hza72dk,t3_t65axt,"As a South African, looking from the outside in, I would say read your constition. The highlights are:

1. Gun Ownership and the right to be part of a militia is protected in your constition. Inside South Africa guns are harder to get and you are not allowed to carry them in a LOT of places, for example; banks, restaurants(because they serve alcohol), bars etc.  Also, I am sure that a lot Ukrainians have had a wake up call about the importance of gun ownership--on the 24 of February their government passed new laws to arm their citizens. I am a big supporter of gun rights because I believe people have the right to defend themselves.
2. Freedom of speech is protected in your constitution. Yes other countries have some degree of it, but you have the best legal protections. The UK for example has section 5 of the public order act of 1986. Look it up, basically it can be interpreted as out lawing any speech that is offensive(Rowan Atkinson gave a speech against it a few a years ago).
3. You have system of states where in theory the goverment is limited. The democrats seem to be trying to stop this, but basically the idea is that if you are 1 in 5 million people(which is the case in about half of your states) and you disagree with a law or a policy you could try sway public opinion and get it changed. However in a country of 368 million people the only people who could realistically change a law they disagree with are the billionaires and ruling elite.
4. You have insane amounts of freedom of movement within your borders. America is one of the largest countries on earth. This is massive. Do you want to live in a diverse culture with good food but social unrest? Go to California. Do you want to live in an ethnically homogenous city and enjoy the high social trust and sense of community? Go to New Hampshire.
5. Freedom of assembly. Compare this to the UK where people were arrested for having gatherings of more than 5 people.  Compare this to Canada where peaceful protestors had the bank accounts frozen by their government.
6. Freedom of religion. Although we take this for granted in westernised countries, places like  China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan still harrass  minority religious groups.

&#x200B;

That being said, like South Africa, which also has a very good constitution, the pandemic kinda showed that governments will completely disregard human rights laws.

Positive freedom is made by creating opportunities for everyone, in which the government plays a big role (you could see this as the socialist system). Negative freedom on the otherhand is created by limiting certain actions that may be viewed as something that limits freedom. This translates in punishing someone who deals damage to someone else in certain ways. This also includes that the government has to be involved as little as possible. This is the prime liberal thought, and since the US is the most liberal country, this applies to them. You can see this in the lack of affordable healthcare and involvement in paying for college etc. Also the severe justice system and the gun law is a sign of negative freedom. These are things that allow you to punish people who deal damage to others or to prevent people from dealing damage to you. That should create freedom according to supporters of this theory. But of course all these measures are a knife that cuts both ways so it’s pretty controversial.

It’s not the Geneva convention that “forbids” expanding ammo its The Hague convention which took place much longer ago. 

The rule only applies to uniformed soldiers of a country that has *also signed on to this convention, and only of this opposing force has also signed on to this convention* 

The Iraq war is an excellent example of this. 

I am a veteran of the Iraq war and heard often we couldn’t use expanding rounds for this reason, however this was wrong. The US could indeed use them and could in fact use them in any conflict. 

1. The US never officially adopted The Hague convention as it was never ratified by congress. It primarily uses FMJ because of commonality with allies and FMJ is in some ways more suited for warfare, and it’s easier to mass produce. 

2. The Iraqi insurgents weren’t state actors and never signed The Hague convention either, so even if the US ratified it they could still use them, and obviously the insurgency could use them as well. And they did. 

So, being you would hypothetically be a non state actor in such a conflict means you could use them and they could be used on you. 

Also, your country and Russia may not have signed on to the convention. 

Furthermore, types of rounds used are quite low on the totem poll when it comes to war crimes. I highly doubt anyone will care anyway. 

Double furthermore, Russia and the US both have made their FMJ ammo in such a way where it can tumble in the body, circumventing any perceived ban anyway. The best example is the Russian 5.45 7n6 round, that is technically an FMJ but actually has a hollow cavity inside the bullet that produces a double “yaw” effect, or essentially two wound wound cavities.

The relation of testosterone acne is with steroids/ prescribed testosterone. When taken,it raises a man's testosterone but with this causes a raise in estrogen because the body has to balence out its hormones ( what typical and naturally happens as a teen) and the heightened estrogen ( which women already have) causes them to have more acne.  Estrogen and testosterone have their side effects. So for example you have have more acne but you can keep your hair longer generally than a guy.

t7bwzh,hzhp15d,t3_t7bwzh,"I don't know about exact hours, but it's best to sleep during hours of darkness and sleeping out of sync with your natural circadian rhythm isn't great for you. For example, there's something called shift work sleep disorder. Approximately 1 in 5 people who work shift work (anything outside the hours of 6 am to 7 pm) experience a loss of 1-4 hours of sleep at night. So sleeping at unnatural times frequently results in insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleeping in sync with your natural circadian rhythm also tends to improve sleep quality.

Also, sunlight stimulates the release of serotonin. Sleeping at odd hours that reduces your exposure to sunlight can contribute to depression.

So I would say that amount of sleep and timing of sleep are both very important.

EDIT: Going by the stats on shift work sleep disorder, both of your examples would increase the odds of experiencing sleep related issues.

EDIT 2: A lot of people *think* they do just fine on less sleep, but in reality they only function on less sleep because they use stimulants during the day.

Ice shelves are also floating, and so removing them also makes no direct change in sea level. However, because glacial ice forms on land and then flows to the ocean, ice shelves are dynamic. They are ""pinned"" at their sides by the topography through which they are flowing. As ice shelves melt and thin, they experience less drag, allowing the ice behind them to flow into the ocean.

Ice sheets are, by definition, grounded, which means that there is some portion of the ice sheet that is heavier than the displaced water. It's this ""excess"" water that can cause sea level rise.

And glaciers are small enough pieces of ice that they don't change the topography, which generally means that they are well above sea level. Most of the sea level rise caused by ice melt has been from mountain glaciers.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646498459.0

But ultimately, despite common assumption, no exercise is particularly good for weight loss because it takes a lot of time, effort and recovery to spend many calories. Instead, 90% of weight loss should simply be about eating less.

Green is dominant to blue in the sense that if you have a gene expression that gives you melanin, you can't end up with blue eyes, but green is still on the table.

Blue eyes mixed with blue will almost always give blue (assuming long family history of blue eyes), but two green eyed parents could have kids with blue, green, or brown eyes. 

Green is still more likely, but green + green = blue has a 25% chance, whereas blue + blue = green is only a 1% chance.

There's a table here: https://www.verywellhealth.com/genetics-of-eye-color-3421603

More about eye color...

There are three main things that determine eye color: black or brown pigment (melanin), a yellow pigment (some sources say lipochrome, others say eumelanin) and the location of the pigment. These all are affected by genes. There *are* other factors that result in, for example, grey eyes instead of blue.

Very low pigment of either type means blue. Its recessive because the gene that causes *no* melanin is recessive and is linked to just one gene. You have it or you don't.

High melanin usually means brown eyes, regardless of whether you have yellow pigment.

Hazel eyes can have similar melanin levels as to brown eyes, but it is grouped differently, usually centered on the inner part of the iris.

Low but not *zero* melanin with moderate to high yellow pigment is necessary for green eyes.

So, it's rare because there are more pieces that you have to have: lower melanin but not *very low*/zero like with blue, *and* yellow pigment. You have to have two less-common components.

Similarly, hazel eyes are rarer than brown because you have to have the genes that cause the unique distribution of melanin required for hazel.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646458676.0

Green comes and goes over a lifetime, many people in my family have bright blue eyes until 4-5, then solidly green eyes for the next 50 ish years, then the green fades to blue or grey. Mine are fading but also getting much brighter and noticeable. The green used to be quite dull, now it kind of jumps out at you. I’ve heard similar changes happening to other green eyed people, green seems labile in a way blue and brown aren’t. It’s weird, and I think it’s more complicated than simple dominance. Other factors can come into play when there’s combinations of genes, and eyes have at least 16 genes influencing color. Each gene can be methylated or otherwise altered by environmental factors that affect expression. I really think eye color is more complex than dominant/recessive.

Step two: Apply conditioner. If it’s a non-shampoo day, start here. There are two schools of thought: apply from the ends up to the roots; or apply from wherever it makes a ponytail down to the ends, skipping the roots. My advice: try both and see what works best for you.

Leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes while in the shower. Use this time to shave, brush your teeth, or contemplate life. Then rinse thoroughly.

Step three: After you get out of the shower (for long hair) use a wide-tooth comb or pick, and start at the very ends of your hair. Do not start at the roots — your hair will snarl, hurt like hell, and break off. So, starting at the ends, slowly comb your hair, working your way up to your scalp a couple inches at a time.

Step four: Apply styling product. I have long, curly, fine hair, so I use a little argan oil and avoid hair dryers. You will have to experiment to find what works for your texture.

Step five: if using a hair dryer, now is the time.

Because they don't know how technology works.


Although, if they have an HDD instead of a SSD then this could help.


As the disk gets full the computer has to try harder to fit all the files on the disk.


If you edit a file which has files stored on either side of it, and make it larger, there might not be room to put the file all in one place, so it might have to store part of the file in the same place that the original file was, and the rest elsewhere.


If a file is deleted or made shorter you may have some free space, but may not have enough space for the entire next file it needs to save without putting part of it in that empty space, so it has to break that new file up and store it in multiple places too.


Moving the read-head back and forth across the spinning platter to get to different parts of files that are broken up into different places takes time, making it take longer to load and save files.


The operating system may try and speed things up by occasionally rearranging how the data is stored on the disk (this is known as defragmentation), but while it's doing this the computer will run slower.


SSDs don't have this problem, since there's no physical read-heads that need to move around.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646477335.0

Autism is a spectrum disease. meaning the impact to the individual may be low, or very debilitating.  So people you see that are seemingly ""normal"" or high functioning, may in fact be on the spectrum.  Others you see that you may suspect are autistic, may in fact have other conditions like Cerebral Palsy, physical brain trauma, or other learning disorders.

Basically, you can't tell by looking.  Even if you work with, or around a person often, you may not be able to say ""ah, autism"".  It takes a well trained professional to say ""Yep, this fits the definition of Autism Spectrum"", but then the work begins to try and define the exact condition that might be at play.

As for your observation of common, as others have said, many people self-diagnose themselves as ""being on the spectrum"".  Maybe they are, maybe they just like having an identity, or worse, an excuse.  When Elon Musk revealed that he has some level of Asperger's, suddenly all sorts of people identified as ""on the spectrum"" as well; so take it as you want.

Popular, but relatively cheap initiatives will probably end up massively over-funded. Boring, relatively a-political functions of the state will probably be neglected. Given that many people decide their political allegiance on the basis of a few issues or policies, it seems likely a large share of the population would allocate their entire taxes to one or two areas.

t78ajg,hzg0j3c,t3_t78ajg,"What would happen if we ate cellulase? Well, it depends on how we digest  
  
If we “digest” cellulose in the same way that other animals like cows and termites do it, that is, with symbiotic bacteria, then we would need a few complementary anatomical and physiological adaptions to facilitate our more efficient digestive systems. For one thing, our body temperature would be a few degrees higher because the bacteria would generate a lot of heat. Unless our bodies adapted to a having a higher internal temperature, we would basically have a life-threatening fever whenever we ate cellulose. For another thing, undigested cellulose, dietary fiber, is used to facilitate digestion in humans, so the body would have to adapt to that as well. Our teeth would need to be more durable if we intend to eat straight-up grass and wood and stuff: we would spend more time chewing. We would fart and probably shit more often, and our farts would be flammable greenhouse gasses.  
  
If we digest cellulose without symbiotic bacteria, if we suddenly become the only animals capable of independent cellulose digestion, then it would depend on the implementation, likely involving the production of cellulase. I don’t know. Some of the negatives from above would still exist, though maybe not the farting and fevers.  
  
On the upside, starvation would be less likely and we could throw fewer things away. People could digest paper, cotton, and wood—anything made of cellulose. If you have an old wood table, just grind it down into sawdust and store it in your pantry. Finished reading a newspaper or a book or a flyer? Have a quick snack.

That’s part of why most Christians will pray to saints particularly when someone is sick. You can try to convince the saint to give some of their grace to the sick person.

So theoretically you can be an offensive player, joining an offense that has good players, but the defense and special teams is so shit, that the team could not win many games last year. 

In that case an offensive player can still do good on a shit team. 

Then take it a step further and realize that the distinction of offense, defense, special teams has sub groups, QBs, offensive line, Receivers/ running backs/ tightends (I included those three in the same group because the offense always has a QB and their 5 offensive line so they are only swapping out those three other positions to fill the 5 remaining spots. 

It’s possible to be an offensive player and do well because of the support of one good group. For example, a running back could still be good if they have a good offensive line, even if the offense sucks. 

Each position also has their own coaches too. So you can have a shit head coach which leads to the team sucking but you can have a great quarterback coach mentoring a young fledging quarterback. 


In conclusion Football is a sport with a lot more positions, players and moving parts overall than other sports. So it’s hard to compare it to other sports.

First, you shouldn't be brushing with much pressure at all, which will limit how fast your can move the brush. You've got 28/32 teeth, and can hit 2 teeth with each stroke, since toothbrushes aren't very big, and teeth aren't that small. That means, ideally, you only need to move your brush 14/16 times to reach each tooth. You'll need to brush 3 surfaces, so that's 42/48 movements. You would want to do more than just 1 wipe, right? Let's say 3 brushes, so that's 126/144 strokes. Each stroke should take around 1 second, giving you 2 minutes of brushing. You'd probably brush a little bit faster than 1 second, but you should also brush the roof of your mouth and tongue as well as the insides of your cheeks. So really, 2 minutes is probably going to be too *little* time to go over your mouth. 2 minutes just for teeth, another 30 seconds to a minute or so for the other surfaces.

Now, I know you *can* scrub those teeth really fast, much faster than 1 second a stroke. But remember, you should be pretty gentle with your teeth! Proper technique is to *brush* your teeth, not scrub them! Think painting with a brush, you should use a gentle motion where you aren't applying much pressure.

20 years later Heinrich Hertz came up with a theory on how to test if this was true and essentially he made a device that when an electric current was applied on his experimental spark gap transmitter it could be detected by a spark micrometer attached to an antenna that was next to it. (A spark gap is just a gap in electrical wires where a spark will form and a spark micrometer is used to measure the amount of voltage in an electric current) So this device was able to prove that electricity can travel in invisible waves and at the speed of light, however he wasn't able to see any use to this as it wasn't usable for transferring electricity. But he did thankfully set off a frenzy of scientists who wanted to find a use for it.

About a decade later in the 1890s a team of scientists discovered ""radio  telegraphy"" which would send pulses of two alternating radio waves of different lengths to signify either a ""dot"" or a ""dash"" which they used to send Morse code messages. 

This was used until around WW1, while there were many attempts they all fell short because the message had extreme static that wasn't a problem for Morse code but made hearing them next to impossible. The invention of vacuum tubes changed that tho as now they could broadcast clearly as long as booth ends were on the proper frequency.

 We have never ""seen"" radio waves as it would be impossible to because they move at the speed  of light and are on the invisible side of the colour spectrum so they just aren't something we can view, much like we only see the effects of light but not the light itself.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646460563.0

It's a shy, timid cat. Which is why ""pussyfooting around"" is about being scared to approach a subject head on, and also raises the image of a cautious cat investigating something dubious.

**UPDATE**

It seems that ""puss"" or a sound like it is common all over Germanic Europe. They think it came from the sound people make when calling a cat (I guess they didn't use to pspspsps). But at the same time (c. 1500) pusillanimous was coming from the old Latin meaning ""weak + animal"" which is how we got pussywillow trees.

Then around the 1600s they started calling women and girls puss with negative connotations about being catty. And then also as a term of endearment. And somewhere along the line it came to mean ""sweet and soft and furry"" as well as cat and girl. Which is where we get genital slang.

That noise probably evolved into the word ""puss"", which was used to do the same thing. Then as a result, ""puss"" became another name for a cat.

Racist white people define - and redefine whenever it will help their narrative - who is acceptable and who is not, and use that othering to protect themselves and justify the mistreatment of other people. But as interracial relationships and biracial people become more and more common, it becomes harder and harder to define and enforce that line so they work harder and harder to do so.

Meanwhile western media still tends to lean towards that white market, so the vague unspoken ranking of races and defining of people's worth seeps into the cultural mindset. Most people in the western world have absorbed it to some degree, even people of other races, and you don't have to be racist yourself to be loosely aware of the lines white culture have drawn. Jews have these jobs, Asians are good at these activities, Black people act like this. Tragically that shit gets internalised and its hard as hell to get it fully out of you once it's in.

t75uz5,hzfolzx,t3_t75uz5,"Motorsports have restrictions and limits on design, but a team can still vary the vehicle within those specs. A very skilled crew may be able to manufacture parts with higher precision, better reliability, lower weight, or other benefits, which can squeeze out a few percent better performance. The crews also need to set up the vehicle for track conditions.

These innovations can be pretty interesting, especially when they end up in consumer vehicles.

As to the racing itself, different drivers have different skills. Even in identical cars, one person is just going to have better reflexes, strength, endurance, and/or coordination. The team and drivers also needs to manage fuel use, tires, and KERS boost. Fuel is heavy, and you'd ideally only drive with the minimum fuel needed to finish the race. Different tires give different traction on different surfaces, and have different rates of wear. Knowing what tires to use, how long to use them, and when to risk another lap can mean the difference between first place and not finishing. F1 KERS boost is pretty cool. At certain parts of the track it activates, and the driver can literally hit a button for extra power and speed. You only get 6.6 seconds worth of boost per lap, so you need to be very resourceful with it!


There's also endurance racing, where a vehicle and team is given a certain amount of time to go as far/complete as many laps as they can. Jockying for position isn't as important, but you still want to be ahead of anyone slower than so you can get more laps in. The driver needs to be going as fast as hard as he can, which is exhausting, AND be aware of the vehicle. A car can only handle so much use before it breaks down, and engineers and drivers need to take that into account. It's a great test not only of how well a driver can drive, but also how skillful an engineering team can be. Squeezing performance inherently lowers reliability. It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to be able to improve performance while still being reliable enough to finish a race.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646473426.0

Anyway, be polite and make it sound like you’re interested in attending the school and learning from them, even if you’re not 100% sure.

Say something along the lines of “I’m interested in the exercise science program at (your university). I don’t feel very challenged at school and I would like to learn more independently until I can attend college. I was wondering if you were willing and able to share freshman-level class materials like notes or assignments, and recommend websites and books so I could dive deeper into the subject.”

* Going one level up, we have **machine code**. Which is executable binary code, the computer can do simple additions and subtractions at this level
* Then we have **assembly language.** This code is easier for humans to understand, but still not the easiest. A single statement of assembly language correlates to a single machine code instruction. So instead of a human having to write 101010101010000101101101 or whatever to mean 2 + 2, they just write something like ""ADD 2 2""

You can look at your own profile to see your lasts posts/comments.  You'll get notified if someone gives you any awards.  

Too many people try to game the system - lots of people want to get quick points so they can spam.   Lots of people want to get huge amounts of points for bragging rights, access to special subs, or possibly selling their account.    Lots of people want to get the highest-rated or lowest-rated posts and comments.   People ""brigade"" - using several accounts/several users to massively upvote or downvote things. 

So, Reddit takes steps to prevent and obscure the point system.  
They fuzz the votes, so nobody knows if their attacks or votes is really making a difference.  
They also don't translate votes to karma on a 1-1 basis.   
There is a declining return on votes - the first 10 or so upvotes grant 1-1 karma.   The next 100 or so are a large fraction of a karma point.   As the count gets higher, the fraction is smaller and smaller.   The effective cap happens around 3000-5000 karma, where you can have 10,000 upvotes or 40,000 upvotes, and still have the same 3k-5k karma for that post/comment.  
Downvotes also have a reduced return, with a smaller number as an effective cap.

Although both the land and sea had some pretty large creatures during the Mesozoic, that was the first era when really large land animals existed. The largest land animals in the Permian were only about the size of cows, earlier land animals were even smaller, and there was a roughly continuous increase in maximum size starting from the first land animals around 450 MYA and peaking in the Jurassic and Cretaceous around 150 - 70 MYA. Among aquatic animals there was also an increase in maximum size; during the Cambrian no marine creature passed roughly the size of a cat, although aquatic creatures did gain in maximum size earlier than terrestrial ones, with eurypterids larger than humans appearing by 410 MYA and giant fish appearing by 370 MYA or so.

Fourth, the largest land mammals existing since the Cretaceous are already extinct. At least some of them (notably the mammoths) are extinct in part *because* they were hunted to extinction by humans. If humans or something like us existed during the Mesozoic, we might have hunted the giant sauropods to extinction too. So there's a bit of an anthropic bias going on here. (That said, the largest land mammal known to ever live was the paraceratherium, which went extinct about 22 MYA long before humans appeared.)

Now, all of this does still leave the question of why land animals since the end of the Mesozoic have never again attained the size of the giant sauropods. We can conjecture some reasons for this. Among them:

- Oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere had a peak in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and have been declining for the past 100 MY or so. (The Triassic was a low point, after another peak during the Carboniferous and Permian.) Greater oxygen concentration would have made it easier for large organisms to grow on land as they could absorb oxygen more quickly.
- The continents were more stuck together during the Jurassic and didn't entirely split apart until the late Cretaceous. (North America, Europe and Asia formed the supercontinent of Laurasia, while South America, Africa and Antarctica formed another supercontinent, Gondwana.) Larger animals tend to require more land area per individual and therefore more total land area to sustain a breeding population, so having a larger amount of contiguous territory may have made it easier for land animals to grow to enormous size. The fact that no continents had migrated to the poles yet and all this territory was warm enough to grow abundant plant life would have helped even further. Likewise, it seems that large mountain ranges were relatively rare during this time, so animals could move unimpeded across vast distances and occupy larger territories.
- While not entirely cold-blooded, dinosaurs probably had less thermal regulation than mammals. This might have helped them to become larger, in the sense that they were not generating as much heat per unit of body mass and faced less risk of overheating.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646463270.0
t6ua9r,hzdwcjv,t1_hzdjx06,"> There was also more oxygen available in the atmosphere. These combined to make larger bodies much more efficient.

This one doesn’t apply for dinosaurs. Throughout the Mesozoic (when the dinos were knocking around) the oxygen levels were either a only little more, or (for most of the time) they were slightly lower than today. 

You are thinking of the Carboniferous, which was many millions of years before the dinosaurs. The extremely high levels of oxygen (along with the humid environment throughout much of the world) allowed insects and other arthropods to grow very large. Nothing large enough for what we would call megafauna, though you probably wouldn’t want to run into a giant 8 foot long millipede, even if they were vegetarian.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646438108.0

* Why is Russia invading Ukraine?

* How is this different from when Russia seized Crimea, or when the US invaded Iraq?

* Couldn't Ukraine just join NATO? Why is NATO doing nothing? 

* Should people in nearby countries like Romania or Poland be scared?

* Is the USA going to join the war? Will there be a draft? 

* Can I join the Ukranian army if I'm not Ukranian?

* Is this all going to lead to nuclear war? Will Putin actually use nukes?

* Why don't we just assassinate Putin? Wouldn't that solve everything?

* Why do some people say 'the Ukraine' and others 'Ukraine'? Is it 'Kiev' or 'Kyiv'?

t74tk8,hzfz5pf,t3_t74tk8,"All Muslim terrorists are from a sect called Wahhabism. I would prefer calling them insurgents instead of terrorists. They may use terroristic tactics but terrorism is not their end goal.

An insurgency is a violent, armed rebellion against authority waged by small, lightly armed bands who practice guerilla warfare from primarily rural base areas. The key descriptive feature of insurgency is its assymetric nature: small small irregulier face the state's large, well-equipped, regular military. Due to this asymmetry, insurgents avoid large-scale direct battles, opting instead to blend in with the civilian population (mainly in the countryside) where they gradually expand territorial control and military forces.

Wahhabism started as an insurgency in the 19th century in Eastern Arabia, in the city of Najd, against the Ottoman state and has not ended yet. Their core beliefs are that God is physical and that you're a disbeliever if you believe otherwise, that any form of mediation to God is paganism, that traditionalism is polytheism and that they must become the rulers themselves. So they're practically saying that they are the only Muslims, and that all other Muslims are pagans. 

Unfortunately, Western Arabia was very undeveloped and the population was uneducated in comparison to Eastern Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Syria and Turkey. So they managed to trick many average people and recruiting soldiers. For example, one of their tricks was saying that the Arabs are the true Muslims and that non-Arabs, i.e. Iraqis, Egyptians, Syrians, Turks and Iranians, they have corrupted the true religion. Unfortunately, they won many people over using dumb rhetoric and fallacies. Then they started attacking cities, raiding caravans and seizing control of some areas.

The Ottoman state was declining so it couldn't secure its lands in Arabia, especially when the British got involved and started funding the Wahhabis to fight their Ottoman opponent. The Wahhabis manages to conquer Western Arabia and the Holy cities of Mecca and Medina surrendered to avoid getting massacred, then they declared the establishment of the Saudi Kingdom. The rulers of Western Arabia escaped north and established the Hashimite Kindom of Jordan.

The Wahhabis are brutal because they disregard human dignity. If you're not a Wahhabi, you are an absolute, abominable, defective animal that should be slaughtered. The only thing that was restraining them was that they didn't want to lose popularity or rule over ruins. So they limited their murder to the extent it didn't hinder their success. In fact, massacres was utilized to cause fear and conquer cities easily.

When the Wahhabis realized that they cannot conquer further, they opted for propaganda instead. They launched a huge campaign that dwarfs Soviet propaganda in comparison according the political scientists. This campaign was entirely funded with the newly discovered oil. Wahhabis started gaining a significant number of followers in Egypt, Syria and Iraq. The Traditional Islamic institutions in these countries couldn't fight them off because they were already crippled as Secular governments attacked these institutions.

In these new environments, the Wahhabis opted for new strategies to trick people. Generally, they had to become less radical and more educated. They started taking the form of what we call Islamists. However, since their teachings are inherently violent, many dedicated followers stayed radical. Soon enough, Wahhabi insurgencies started popping up in these areas and others. Generally speaking, whenever there is a political disturbance in any state, they flock there in huge numbers.

New organisation started developping such as ISIS and al-Qaida. Note that their main goal is to topple governments in the Middleast. They don't care about the West. More than 80 percent of victims of Wahhabis are Muslims. They occasionally attack the West to support their political purposes in the Middleast. For example, by attacking charlie hebdo, they manage to get legitimacy and popularity among their followers as the ""defenders of Islam"". They're not attempting to invade the West. They want to conquer the Middleast, but thankfully they're failing and Wahhabism is dying out, even in the Saudi Kingdom as people start to realize it's bullshit.",0,0,0,False,False,False,1646481905.0

Alcphpls evaporate quickly, so if the bottle sat dry, I wouldn't worry about any rubbing alcohol being in there. The purer it is the more it will burn as it dries out the tissues it touches.

All drinking alcohols have some percentage of water. First because pure alcohol wants a water bond so strongly, that you have to put in disproportionately more energy to get that last bit of water out. Second, companies make more in sales by selling you multiple 40% bottles, than fewer 95% bottles.

The normal technique is to take a fixed weight of food, burn it, and heat water to measure the thermal energy it releases. So you can take 10 grams of peanuts and measure it produces 15 calories (I just made up the number). And if you had 20 grams of peanuts you can just double your previous answer or if you had 5 grams, you could cut your answer in half.

And when it's not possible to do the test for complex food they also can calculate calories by just adding together component parts. So 15 grams of peanut butter that was made from 10 grams of peanuts and 5 grams of water can be estimated to have the same caloric value as 10 grams of peanuts alone. 

And measurements don't really factor in an individual's metabolism at all.

>There are such thing as adult words. Teaching them adult words are inappropriate.

How exactly are penis and vagina adult words? I can see curses being adult words, cause you dont want a small child using fuck or shit as a crutch. 

Honestly we teach them about every other body part, what makes penises or vaginas any different?

starving in a figurative sense? sure. 

its not actually starving until the malnourishment is having a serious negative medical effect on the body. 

its recommended when dieting to only do 1000 calorie deficit maximum, and 500 calorie deficit is recommended as safer.

if someone is wanting to lose weight just by cutting calories, but they are feeling really malnourished, like feeling lightheaded/dizzy especially when standing up, then they should increase calories and get their deficit by adding exercise to make up for it. 

>You always seem to end up hungry as hell when trying to eat less calories

i know that feeling. my main tips to fight it:

- avoid eating right when you wake up. it easier to hold out when you havnt eaten yet. 

- start the morning with a lot of water. 

- sparkling water can help give a sense of fullness if the stomach feels too empty. 

- caffeine can also stave off the need to eat early in the day. i do like 200mg at about 11am and another 100mg at 2:30. any more than that, and it can be harder to fall asleep. i recommend caffeine in pill form (no doz, or walgreens ""awake"" store brand.) 

- avoid diet soda, diet anything. the artificial sweeteners are a scam. its true those drinks may have zero calories,  but the body detects it as if it were a sugar, and starts trying to convert blood sugar to fat (i.e. sapping your energy and making you feel more tired). its better to have a natural, low calorie drink than a zero calorie artificial one. really, water and sparkling water are your best bets for liquid, because cutting sugary drinks is the easiest way to cut calories.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646462041.0

I'm unfortunately quite familiar with the warning signs and I've noticed those signs quite a lot in other people. But I can't really tell them how to live their life.

So no, if you're getting your neccessary calorie intake. Like what you actually need, the amount that those government sites show around is the same number they use when they wanna torture criminals.

t733if,hzfci90,t1_hzfaw2s,"Eat in proportional and moderate sizes. If you want to eat more, you can go and get more. But if you have a lot on your plate you feel more obligated to eat all of it.

Eat slowly if you can. It's easier for your body to recognize when it's full if food is coming in slowly, and some people tend to realize that they feel full with less food when they ate slowly, then the amount of food that they ate when eating quickly.

Your body gives you cravings for a specific reason. Learn how to figure out what exactly your body craves and substitute it for something else. 


Recognize the reasons behind why you eat. Learn to recognize if you're actually hungry, or if you're just bored or sad or angry.


But also, there is no proven way to consistently lose weight in a healthy way. If you change how you eat drastically, such as going on a diet, your body will take that as reason to go into starvation mode. It's why so many people gain weight back once off diets  And also a lot of diets have been proven to cause your metabolism to become slower. Because of the starvation mode your body goes through.


But I would also say that like. Besides all of this, I recommend reading about this subject yourself. Read about stuff you agree with and disagree with. Figure out why you want to lose weight, and read about the science of weight gain and loss from various people.

I would also recommend learning about eating disorders, so that if you do try and lose weight, you're more likely to recognize disordered eating that you may be doing or thoughts you may have.

Although I do have more to say about this, it's not really relevant to the question, so I'll end my comment here with one last paragraph.

Although calorie counting isn't inherently bad, it can easily lead to eating disorders. Eating disorders can happen to anyone. It can start because of very good intentions, but it can sneak up on you. So that's why I generally recommend what I said earlier in this comment rather than calorie counting, as I am very familiar with how disordered eating can occur because of calorie counting. It is also not a guaranteed way to lose weight and to have it stay off.",2,0,0,False,False,False,1646464454.0

i met this person in a party and went to their apartment after the party, but we didn’t catch any information from each other (name, number, i didn’t even remember to look the apartment number). but i accidentally left it’s property with one of its belongings (a sunglasses) and, besides the fact i want to meet this person again, i want to give this sunglasses back. but the only information i have is the apartment location inside the building.
so, my point is to get someone downstairs so i can explain this situation above, then if they don’t trust me to go in, i explain where is the apartment and they will tell me the number so i can talk to who i want to.

important: we were alone in this meeting, and we both cared a lot about each other, so this person trusts me.

i actually ringed in two apartments and told them that i put a package in the wrong box, and then asked if there was someone living in that apartment (of course they didn’t know that). but that is how i know the intercom’s quality. anyway, maybe the best option is finding the building manager through someone’s intercom, then explaining to him the situation and hope that he will come downstair.

You are saying that they would go extinct without us farming them? Maybe, that's not definite. But what would be the problem with that anyway? They are not contributing to natural food webs or systems of habitat generation. They are completely detached from systems of nature.

In fact, animal farming actively detracts from these natural systems. Through habitat and ecosystem destruction like deforestation, eutrophication, and land clearing for feed and pasture. This also leads to mass biodiversity loss. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and land clearing. We are losing hundreds of species every year due to animal agriculture. So if you care about extinction then stop supporting what is causing it.


Maybe your point is that it's better to live and suffer than never to have lived at all. But I would have to disagree. 

You can't compare the traits and properties of a concrete implementation of a life (like joy or suffering) to the properties of an abstract or virtual potential of a life. It's a category mistake. The hypothetical life that could have been can't feel, it can't experience joy or suffering. 

Trying to say that one is better than the other is fallacious. And doubly so when we are discussing suffering that is predicated on the ability of the subject to experience. Something a null existence can't do and properties a null existence can't have. You wouldn't complain about never being born and we don't mourn the loss of potential life when using contraception.

> He also said not to include header files.


That's just stupid. Your word list at the very least should be in its own header file.


But if he's not going to make an exception for even that, I guess you'll have to put it in the main file.


I assume you're allowed to use header files from the standard library though, you don't need to include them with your program.


> He only taught us how to create a random number. So, I don't know how to find where valid words are stored.


I don't know what language you're using, I only know a little C that I haven't used for a very long time, so I might not get things right and it may not be how you need to do things, but two different ways spring to mind.


First, you can define the words in an array, something like this:


        #define MAXWORDS 10
        char word[MAXWORDS][] = ""purple"", ""kitchen"",
                ""elephant"", ""pineapple"", ""invent"", ""foggy"",
                ""lamp"", ""sleeping"", ""forget"", ""naughty"";


Then you just generate a random number with a maximum value of MAXWORDS and you use word[number] as your word.


(**Edit:** Or you can have an empty array that your program fills with words from an external list. Instead of MAXWORDS you might have a variable called wordCount that counts how many words are put in there. When you said no header files I mistakenly assumed this meant no external files at all.)


Or you can use a SWITCH/CASE statement (IF statements would also work, but wouldn't be appropriate in this situation), by creating a function something like this:


        int getWord(int number, char word[])
        {
               switch (number) {
                       case 0 : strcpy(word, ""purple"");
                       case 1 : strcpy(word, ""kitchen"");
                       case 2 : strcpy(word, ""elephant"");
                       case 3 : strcpy(word, ""pineapple"");
                       case 4 : strcpy(word, ""invent"");
                       case 5 : strcpy(word, ""foggy"");
                       case 6 : strcpy(word, ""lamp"");
                       case 7 : strcpy(word, ""sleeping"");
                       case 8 : strcpy(word, ""forget"");
                       case 9 : strcpy(word, ""naughty"");
                       default: strcpy(word, ""error"");

I live in the middle of nowhere with extremely limited public transport. My mother doesn't drive. Her partner (now ex partner as of recently) does, but he is becoming increasingly unfit and only does really important and short journeys now. I pay just under £500 a month on taxis getting to and from work. This is close to half my monthly income just getting to and from work. I also pay between £200 - £300 in rent and fuel, because when my mum's ex partner is for enough to take me to work, he charges me extortionate prices.

I'm trying to move out too, but due to my work location also being slightly less of a public area, there are very few locations that I can move to and  benefit from. However, for me to view a place, it's gonna cost me a minimum of £40 to get there and back per place. And due to only turning 19 tomorrow, my age paired with no independent renting experience doesn't give me the best chance, so I've got to decide whether or not I want to spend that much viewing a place only to most likely be turned down.

So here's the thing.... with parents being annoying, they want you to leave. You're 22. They don't want you to live with them until you're 40, so they want to start making your time there less and less comfortable/enjoyable to make you want to leave. That's just how life goes.

If your best friend didn't get the score they wanted on a test, you wouldn't berate them and be unkind, right? You'd reassure, encourage, and support them. 
This isn't the same as lying to yourself - a really good, close friend is honest when you need them to be, right? But it can be done in a gentle way. E.g. if they scored badly because they didn't study, you might gently suggest that you could be their study buddy to help next time. Practice taking that same kinder approach with yourself.

You have to spend every waking moment with yourself - so try and make friends with yourself.

t71mbb,hzf6la2,t3_t71mbb,"There's actually a reason for this.
For most of Western Civilization, women were raised to be home makers to one degree or another.  One of the longest standing ways to accomplish this has been to instill in young girls a near pathological aversion to anything ""dirty"".  It's so ingrained at this point that people don't even THINK about it any more.  That way, all their husband and fathers need to do is be more tolerant of messes and they will never need to clean themselves.  Just wait until the girls ""need"" to clean.  

That's how it works in their own homes, anyway.  In public (or anywhere women and girls do not consider cleaning to be ""their responsibility"") it tends to have the opposite effect.  They avoid whatever they perceive to be ""dirty"" to a much greater degree then men and boys do.

So, they will basically do the least amount humanly possible to get out of a public restroom as fast as humanly possible.  So you get all kinds of accumulated messes that they would never tolerate in their own spaces.  Because not making them means spending more time in an inherently ""dirty"" space that they have no responsibility for.

This is, of course, an outrageous generalization, especially these days when we have gotten a bit better, as a society, about doing things like that, but it is a long understood cultural side effect of intrenched gender norms.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646460527.0

Mostly, I think retailers have gotten used to using less coin so they've left the signs up.  Also, in the United States, things are moving more towards going digital/cashless, so in general, companies \*tend\* to be discouraging the use of coin/cash and prefer card/funds transfer apps to pay for things.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646426067.0

When the pandemic really hit the US in spring of 2020, many people stop going out to retail establishments, and started getting consumer goods delivered. This was a dramatic change, although it has steadily ameliorated over the last two years, in many parts of the country retail sales or retail traffic are still modest even while the economy itself has grown substantially. Result, cash transactions have dropped off, and so businesses haven’t had ready access to small denomination coins. Even as, given the economic rebound, their business volume has returned or even started to grow.  Meanwhile all the people who are now buying items to be delivered and still limiting their contact face-to-face with other people when possible have all the change but they in previous years would’ve been exchanging for goods and services sitting in a coffee cup on their bathroom shelf.

Yes, the meat could increase the coin supply. My understanding is they have done this somewhere. But, ultimately, this isn’t something that they’re going to spend a huge amount of resources on. Because  there really hasn’t been an acute problem with coins past the first several months of 2020. As I say, mostly it’s an annoyance. If the mint grossly inflated their production of coins, that would flood the market, and we don’t need that many coin circulating around. We were already moving towards a cashless society, as it is largely the de facto case in some parts of northern Europe and has been for years.  So if the mint puts a bunch more coins in circulation they’re not gonna do any thing valuable. It’s just more coins to be clattering around. Plus, as the pandemic is alleviating, The expectation is that we are going to move towards of return to retail normalcy. It’s not going to look exactly the same as it did in 2018. Because too much retail traffic has moved to delivery modes, and people are pretty much OK with it, which of course is just an acceleration of a trend from the past 20 years.

t6wsjf,hze4x62,t3_t6wsjf,"Nothing that everyone else is mentioning is not going to be just as bad, if not worse, for your skin than doing drugs. Most of the negative effects of drugs come from consistent use(leading to neglect of health, chronic dehydration, etc.). If you just do them a few times you're not going to look like a crackhead. Don't do drugs if they're illegal or illegal for you, and don't do drugs if they negatively impact your life at all.

Drug use is very different from most experiences. Mushrooms is the simplest because physically it just poisons you, but you also have a very unique feeling caused by it temporarily blocking your ability to differentiate yourself from the rest of the world. It has the potential to really improve your empathy and sense of what you care about. It's also an 8 to 12 hour experience, so there is a big commitment to doing it. You basically have to set aside a day or night as a day you're doing shrooms.

LSD is similar, but more artificial if that makes sense. Instead of feeling at one with the world, you get a lot more of the hallucinations and heightened feelings. 

Weed is a lot like shrooms, but much more muted and shorter lasting. Lots of people report out of body experiences, but you're not going to be high more than 2 hours unless you keep smoking. You're basically just going to find things funnier and be less composed for a few hours. Your impaired state generally makes you more confident in what you are saying(whether or not it is true), leading to people like Joe Rogan confidently saying very silly things while smoking on their podcasts.

Alcohol is one of the more damaging, and it just limits your inhibitions. It's a ""depressant"", which means it basically slows your thinking. Having a drink in a calm setting can help you contemplate your life, having a drink at a party will limit your inhibitions, making your more lively and generally allowing you to have more fun(you don't have time to doubt your ability to dance before you start dancing). Alcohol is also the most damaging to your body of this list, and the most socially acceptable to abuse. Lots of people become alcoholics for years in plain view of their friends and family and it's only called out when it is too late and they are well into addiction.

Cocaine(which is the same thing as crack) is an accelerant. It's going to get your brain moving faster and prevents you getting tired, so you can party all day and all night. I haven't done cocaine, so I can't tell you much more.

That's basically everything I have experience with. As a healthcare worker, I can't partake in any of these anymore, and I really don't miss them. They were fun, and I wouldn't shun anyone for trying them, but they are an experience that can permanently effect your outlook on life and can potentially be pretty uncomfortable.

Why instead isn't the attitude, ""So and so chose to do ---, and N-- availed themself of a lawful remedy which means so and so will pay a price according to the guidelines of the justice system if guilt is substantiated?""

There are several unstated assumptions being made here:

- That the ""perpetrator"" is, in fact, a perpetrator - that they did actually do the thing they're being accused of. Do you *know* this; did you see it with your own eyes? Did you see them do *something* but misinterpret what you saw? Did you only hear they did something from someone else's report - if so, have you only heard one side of the story, the accusation, and immediately assumed guilt and ran from there? *Most* people paint themselves as the victim because no one is the villain in their own story. Is there a ""he-said she-said"" situation involved where there isn't any objective evidence either way?

- Is the thing they're accused of actually illegal? Most people do not know the law anywhere near as well as they assume to (something something Duning-Kruger), hence why lawyers exist. If it wasn't illegal, then it's unjust that they're sitting in prison over it. Does it not somehow ethically implicate you if your incorrect accusation got someone imprisoned over something they shouldn't be?

- Does the justice system always fairly assess guilt? Jurors are *supposed* to only judge based on the facts of the case, but they're human too and subject to all the same cognitive biases as you (in particular, to assume guilt for someone outside their in-group), and plus, because they're the triar of fact, they aren't accountable to anyone for their judgment. If they send an innocent person to prison, it's no skin off their back, because they can't be punished for a ""wrong decision"".

- Even if the ""perpetrator"" *is* guilty and the act they are accused of *is* a crime, is the punishment proportionate to the act? Does the law they are indicted under have good reason to exist in the first place? Legal fault is not the same as moral fault, and even neutral observers are predisposed to punish with unbelievable harshness over even minor infractions.

t6rjms,hzcxvjx,t3_t6rjms,"The question about subways is related to how cities developed *around* cars after about 1940, a time of huge population growth and economic expansion. Anything that got built at that time, got built oriented toward cars. Cities gave up on building mass transit, and suburbs that developed at that time hardly even bothered to begin with. Nobody thought about the side effects or impacts this might have, and even if they did, automotive companies were hugely powerful and influential. European cities didn't have quite the same flexibility since most of them had existed long, long before the age of cars. European cities, in my observation, are used to retrofitting stuff to make it all fit together. Americans are bad bad bad at that.

Look at China for this example. It made sense for China to have a large public transportation system as a lot of people live in congested areas.

America has a more diverse population divide across the nation. Helps that even in China, it's still very car centric but they also have 3x the population of America and more people living in one area, so public transportation made sense in those specific areas there.

t6rjms,hzcz6v0,t3_t6rjms,"From an European perspective. A key issue is distance. 

If you take high-speed rail, let's say at 300km/h you can cross a large European country in 3h, ad a couple of stops like a major city every 300km, and you still get a 4h trip to cross the country, which is competitive with plane (When taking into account that the station is central, and that you can arrive at the station 10 minutes before your train, and still take the time to buy the newspaper before going to the platform) 

In the US, there isn't really much place where you'll find a large city every 300km. Let's take  (I try to draw-it without watching a map, it's more funny, so forgive me if I'm wrong) let's imagine an Austin-Chicago line, you could stop in Dallas, Oklahoma City, Kansas-city, and may-be even St-Louis before reaching Chicago. But it's like 6 cities large enough to be named by a random European over the stretch of 2000 or even 3000km. Even at 300km/h the trip will be longer than the train. 

The second part is that American cities are extended. Let's take Dallas where I've been a couple of time. To not offend the locals, I need to call it Dallas-Fort-Worth, and it's like 100km wide highway network without a couple of central districts  but mostly american-style houses spread over a huge surface. so wherever you put the train-station you still end-up away from your destination.

t74040,hzfk00q,t3_t74040,"Hi Kubdiepie,

On its own, you could quite feasibly use the sort of rapid prototyping Musk Usees to rapidly develop new airframes - you can see that process at work in places like NASA'S X Planes.


However, that doesn't work so well for military aircraft for a couple of reasons.

First, the way they are constructed and used are very different from either his tesla cars or space x rockets. Tesla is able to impliment incremental improvements because they're continuously mass producing their cars for lots of different customers, so can add in changes as they go. By contrast, very few modern aircraft get built, and because they're all going to the same customer, standardisation matters more than incremental improvements for each one so they can be easily maintained and supplied.

However, these aircraft are also expected to be used frequently and for long periods without major maintainance in large fleets, unlike space x rockets that aren't designed to fly more than about a dozen times, and are produced in very small numbers and not mass produced. Consequently, making frequent improvements makes sense because he'll use up all his block II falcon nines in a couple of years, say, while f35s are projected to be in service for as long as half a century. Each rocket also gets completely refurbish after each landing, allowing for iterated improvements to be rwtrofitted more easily.

Second, the priorities of the military aren't the same as those of rocketry or vehicles. What matters most is that things are cheap, long-lasting, simple and, most of all, reliable. When war comes, you have to know that what you are using *works*, every time, first time, no matter the conditions. Consequently, integrating newer technology isn't necessarily desirable, because it hasn't had time to be tested and have its vulnerabilities exposed, explotired, and patched yet. Having the cutting-edge computer chip is no good if tjeurres a way for the Chinese government to hack all 9f them, or if they don't work in a weird edge-case randomly.

This is why modern military tech often looks old - it's taking exhaustively-tested, rugged equipment that is already not cutting-edge when it is introduced, and then kept on the vehicles for another 2 decades or more until the next gen is trusted enough and the funds for replacing stuff are available. (this is also why pretty much all space hardware runs off computers from '05 still)

(NB this can also make kit look more retro than it really is, because the emphasis on ruggedness flashes with our modern aesthetic priorities of sleekness, minimalism, and lightweighting).

Finally, modern military systems have to integrate and operate seamlessly alongside a much wider array of systems and epitment. Whereas your company might upgrade all its laptops at once, the US army can't just rip out all the computers in all its systems than range from 1950-2022 and re-configure and replace all of them at once. Even if they could, then standardising all of that with the rest 8r their NATO allies, who often have much smaller budgets and are even more reliant on older tech from places like the USSR makes internal wholesale reorganisation look like a walk in the park.

This extends to everything, from radio equipment protocols to diameter of hoses and nozzles for refueling rigs to mourning points of recovery cranes. And all of this is constrained by the lowest, or near-lowest common denominator. The Hungarian airforce still use T-64 tanks that physically can't fit a bigger fuel receptical in the engine bay? Either we cut them out of the alliances' standardisation that is what gives it a its strength, or we keep using the old standard designed for outdated requirements.

Now there are some way we can get around these issues, and 'future proof' our designs to make future upgrades more easy, and thus encouraging them to be done more rapidly or frequently), eg adopting a standardised way of mounting equipment to our firearms like sights, lasers, or lights have allowed us to increase our capabilities as those technologies develop without adopting an entirely new weapon. However, these more mitigate than eliminate these inherent problems.

Also, the military doesn't have a profit incentive - it can only lose money for the government, so the priority financially is on minimising costs, rather than maximising future profit, while rapid iteration sacrifices the former for the latter. 

All these things make using trusted, legacy designs and keeping them in service though life-extending upgrades the prefered way of managing procurement, especially in peacetime, where being cutting-edge isn't as important.

If you want to see what current bleeding-edges6him aircraft design looks like, check our either what NASA/DARPA are doing with their research aircraft, or in-development, 6th gen future jet fighters like the Tempest or FCAS that'll come into service in a few years time.

Hope this helps, but if you have any more ideas I'd love to hear them :)

Are you serious?  You can't possibly be serious with a question like that; now I'm starting to think you're trolling. They have been at the cutting edge of military aircraft development for decades now, and are the designers and builders of some of the most advanced fighters and attack aircraft out there in the world right now, such as the F-22 and F-35.

Constitution > Treaties > Laws.  So it would take either rewriting all the 454 Indian treaties or passing a constitutional amendment to change the name.

Attempts to change the treaties usually end up with the Indians being robbed of land, I don’t really see the Indians going along with it.

From what I’ve read from Indians on line, it would be correct to refer to an Indian by their personal name (Wanda Mankiller for example), their tribe (Navaho for example), their nationality (American).   

Using “Indian” is a little off, because the various tribe each have their own history, culture, and language.

(someone outside the Americas, or even someone who's just not educated on the matter tend to think native culture was very similar but that's like saying all the European countries are the same because to the untrained eye they all wore similar clothes and had similar buildings and art)

It was used frequently to lump them all together into one group so that's why some people feel United by it. Native American is used for tribes in Canada, south america and Mexico because they were treated differently

The natives of the USA region were brought to their knees in constant hard fought wars and broken treaties where it wasn't nearly as brutal in the rest of the Americas (with obvious exceptions of course many tribes were treated horrifically everywhere and I'm not suggesting otherwise, just the USA had a unique experience that was similar across all tribes where in other regions it was case by case with many large gaps that didn't allow for that sense of unity until much later)

Basically in the USA it's seen as a unity thing where in the rest of the Americas it's an offensive thing. Usually part of the confusion comes from people hearing other countries say native Americans or first Nations or indigenous and believe Indian is offensive without understanding history of it.

t6syaq,hzee8vi,t3_t6syaq,">What is wrong with compromise path as a solution to conflicts?

Sometimes compromise is fine. However, it shouldn't be used naively in every situation.

In a game-theoretic sense, a big problem with compromise is that it creates an incentive for each participant to demand something more extreme than what they actually want, in order to manufacture a compromise that is closer to what they actually want. This leads to a sort of 'arms race' of dishonesty with both participants demanding something ridiculously extreme in order to balance out the other participant's demand. That dishonesty dilutes the actual quality of information on which to make a decision, increasing the chance of the resulting compromise being skewed one way or another. Ideally we would want a conflict resolution system that encourages participants to be honest about what they want and increases the quality of information available to make a decision.

In a more philosophical sense, the compromise approach often carries an unstated connotation that there is no fundamentally correct answer to the problem, no principles from which to derive a better solution than just balancing everyone's desires against each other. It is easy to invent scenarios where this is clearly not the approach we want in some moral sense. (For instance: I want to steal your car, you don't want anything stolen from you, so we compromise on me just stealing your piggy bank. Well, that's not okay is it? It seems like there was something fundamentally valid about your demand to have nothing stolen, making compromise a morally inappropriate solution in my favor.) Philosophers call this problem the ['golden mean fallacy'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation)

>But such happened, that this things really disturb Russian government.

My understanding is that that's not really the full story as far as the russian government is concerned. It's more-or-less an open secret that Putin and his closest friends subscribe to insane geopolitical theories stating that Ukraine is an illegitimate state, that Russia has the rightful destiny to lead the world into the future, and that Ukraine must be dismantled in the interest of bringing about absolute russian hegemony. The complaints about NATO threats seem to be merely an excuse to be used because these actual reasons are too politically incendiary to be brought onto the diplomatic stage. Putin isn't interested in making compromises, he's interested in making up lies and excuses to get what he believes is necessary in the long run, which involves no compromise at all.

>Our Ukrainian government can set what they want and what they afraid of [...] Then, need to be set different pathes how to achieve this [...] The, Russian government will look on to this variants and for each will say ""what they want and what they afraid of""

This is how normal international diplomacy takes place. If a reasonable diplomatic solution were possible, it would have already been agreed upon. Most of the time this happens, because various governments align closely enough on their intentions that they are willing to take on minor costs rather than the much larger cost of degenerating into violence. I'm sure plenty of people in the ukrainian government, russian government, NATO, EU, etc were already working on this stuff for years. It *already* didn't work out, because in this case what the ukrainian government wants and what Putin's regime wants have diverged to the point where each considers the cost of degenerating into violence to be less than the value of whatever they would have to give up in order to come to a nonviolent agreement.

Of course, the primary costs of war are not borne by governments and politicians so much as by soldiers and common people. Which is why so many wars cause so much death and destruction while achieving what seems like relatively little change in the world order. We've seen this happen repeatedly throughout history. Perhaps it could have been avoided if Russia had been a more democratic nation with greater accountability to the desires of its own common people (most of whom would rather not have a war, or the burden of economic sanctions that they now face). It seems that the lesson to be learned here is not to allow nations to degenerate into autocracies and personality cults in the first place, because the further a nation moves down that path, the easier it is for the petty whims of autocrats to ruin everything for everyone else.

>E.g., such ""fantastic"" solution of that Russia may want more territory, but really no one will give it, - let's start ""space colonization program"".

About setting higher demands to end up on what is wanted - interesting. And you are right that parts need to be honest about their demands.

About ""golden mean fallacy"", understood. But usually we had to choose between paths, because if robbery is armed, still better to stay alive without piggy bank, than be dead with car. Something will still happen and better is to choose what will happen if we can.

""My understanding is that that's not really the full story as far as the russian government is concerned. "" - I think in same way. People usually not saying true reasons of their actions, especially on the level of government, because people will definitely not follow them, and not understand them.But what can be done - is contact with Russian government as with ""black box"" and try various things and look on to results.

""This is how normal international diplomacy takes place. If a reasonable diplomatic solution were possible, it would have already been agreed upon. "" - this really can be true, than all is really bad. But, from my experience very hard to achieve compromise even in simple situations because of simple human things. Like compromise in queue at the store. But in such way government of countries need to be on the level above to usual people (moral, intellectual, self control levels).

""It seems that the lesson to be learned here is not to allow nations to degenerate into autocracies and personality cults in the first place, because the further a nation moves down that path, the easier it is for the petty whims of autocrats to ruin everything for everyone else."" - here I personally think that there really is some balance of ""good and bad"" in the world.

Women.

And to remotely address all the clowns in the comments thinking this is ""mEn NoT uNdErStAnDiNg WoMeN"": Project Makeover is an insanely successful mobile game, reaching top charts in just four days since release and has been downloaded over 23 million times by the end of 2021.
