Handwriting experts weren't able to deduce duress from the letter the kidnapper sent, and no one was sure if she was being held against her will or not. So how could one communicate duress secretly in a letter like that?

t7ihcr,difference between animal related majors in college? and what university offers those majors?,Unanswered,1,1.0,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7ihcr/difference_between_animal_related_majors_in/,1," 

I'm a freshman in my local community college struggling to decide what universities to apply to as I don't understand what major I want.

I'm really overwhelmed with all the options but I don't fully understand them all.  I love animals immensely, and I hope they will be the focus of my career one day. However, I don't know any specifics of what I want to do. I would love to work with exotic animals whether in the wild, zoo, or rehab, or even trainer.  I definitely want something hands on but I'm not sure what kind of career options that would give me. 

I'm studying biology right now since my college doesn't offer anything close to what I want this seemed like the best choice however I  don't like it that much. I think its a bit interesting but its not what I'm looking for especially with all the chemistry and physics involved.  From my understanding, being a biology major seems to be 90% microbiology, biochemistry, etc.

I have been trying to research what I could major in as well as schools that offer those degrees and I found animal science. However after more research I found that animal science leads to working in a farm which doesn't bother me but not my ideal choice. I would rather have more exotic animals and if that's not possible then a vet assistant would also be nice. I'm mostly looking for just a bachelors but getting a masters would not bother if it meant a more satisfactory job. 

What sort of major would be best to study/what schools offer the best courses for these majors?",1646513235.0

I tried to post this on r/personalfinance, but it got instantly removed. So, long story short, I had my name legally changed and updated all my info with the SSA, DMV, etc. My license, passport, and everything else all have my new name on them.

I recently received a settlement check that's payable to \[*my old name here*\].

Here's where the trouble begins. See, before I changed my name, I used to bank with Chase. Due to their bullshit monthly fees and a number of other problems I had with them, I closed that account. I then opened two new accounts with two different banks. Predictably, neither of these banks are allowing me to deposit the check because the name on the check (my old name) doesn't match the name on my account (my new name). I called customer service for both banks and explained the situation, even offering to provide the court documents that prove my identity, but they wouldn't budge. Supposedly, if I had opened my account(s) under my old name and then filed a name change request after I got it changed (like I did with Chase before I closed my account), it would have been possible, but since I opened my account under the new name, there's nothing they can do.

PayPal wouldn't let me deposit the check either, and their customer service basically gave me the same reason (even though my account with them WAS opened under my old name).

So I'm kind of stuck. Does anyone know if there's any way I can cash this check? It's not a HUGE sum of money, but it's enough that I'd be pretty down if I lost it.",1646512860.0

t7hhg8,"Grandma requiring assisted living/care now lives with parents, stressful situations have arisen. Advice?",,1,1.0,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7hhg8/grandma_requiring_assisted_livingcare_now_lives/,7,"Hello!

My (24F) maternal grandmother (82F) just recently moved in with my mom (52F) and dad (49M). Over the last five years it became apparent that grandma was no longer able to live independently (she fell three or four times in 2021 and has dementia that's worsened due to a head injury). She was living in an independent living facility, but things soon regressed to the point that she needed further intervention (help bathing, sitting/standing, drives to the doctor etc). Since grandma begs to not be put in a home, my parents renovated an addition on their house for grandma to move in. Dad works full time, and my mom is the primary caretaker/stays home.

My concern is that my grandma can be very particular and stubborn, and very often can be contentious. I can see this all  puts great stress and frustration on my parents, especially my mom. There are arguments and stress for all, and I am hoping to get some advice to help alleviate the situation. I've outlined some of the problems here (sorry for the length):

-Grandma likes to make her own breakfast and lunch, which is great. But she often takes 1-1.5 hours to do so. This morning she took a hardboiled egg from the fridge and put it on a piece of toast. This took 1.5 hours because she can't stay focused on one task. This sets her eating schedule all off and contributes to it being hard getting her to bed (see bedtime issue below). When someone else tries to make food for her she often doesn't want it/insists on doing it herself.

-Grandma needs to use a walker (due to the previous falls) but always leaves/forgets it around the house. When she is reminded or the walker is brought to her, she often gets defensive/angry. This defensiveness usually only comes up against my mom; not me, my father or siblings.

-Grandma suffers incontinence issues, and uses adult diapers. She is paranoid of leaks at night, to the point where she wears four diapers (yes, FOUR) every night. Not only is this wasteful and expensive, but it's really unnecessary and time consuming (see bedtime point below). In the past grandma has insisted she wet the bed when she in fact never did.

-She is very particular about certain products/items she wants (especially incontinence products), but with her dementia always changes her mind/switches her opinion. Ex: mom orders some shorter pads because grandma doesn't like the long ones. When the short ones arrive, she decides she actually REALLY LIKES the long ones and needs those instead.

-Getting grandma to bed is a BIG problem. When bedtime comes around, grandma becomes the most contentious and pushes things. One night she found a sharpie and started to label the absorbency of pads on the wrappers (drawing little water drops, just like on the outside of the box). Another night she had an ""empty"" stomach and insisted on eating at 11:30 PM (we'd just had a big dinner, and when she was offered snacks before bed she said she wasn't hungry). The next night she needed to reorganize her closet, again, at 10:30-11:00 PM. This combined with her incontinence concerns makes the bedtime process crazy long. Usually lasts until 11:30-midnight. She just doesn't want to go to bed, but my mom can't go to bed herself until she knows grandma is in bed to prevent another fall. Therefore my mom (and grandma, who always falls asleep in her chair during the day) are not getting enough sleep.

-Above all else, grandma can't safely be left alone. My mom can no longer leave the house, unless it's to walk the dog/something quick, or someone else is around to watch her. My grandma insists that she's independent/can stay alone, but with her history and dementia she can't safely be left alone for a prolonged period of time.

As you can imagine, my mom is at her wits end. I've spoken with her about all this but she insists that everything is fine. I am really worried that all of this is going to progressively a worse toll on my mom in a bad way. Does anyone have advice on this situation? I thought getting an at-home caregiver to help occasionally might help? I'm hoping I can get some ideas here to hopefully help/lighten the load on my parents. Thanks in advance! Some additional/potentially helpful info:

-Myself and my siblings do not live at home. We each live 1.5-2.5 hours away (my older brother and I work full time, younger brother is a student). We try to visit and help out whenever we're able to. I try to relieve my parents of care duties when I'm here, but often grandma can be even more stubborn with someone who is not my mom. 

-My mom's sister/my maternal aunt (F50) also works full time but lives far away (7 hours). Grandma had previously lived in an independent assisted living facility in the same town as my aunt, but my grandma's constant needs were getting in the way of my aunt's job.

-My dad works in education, so he's gone during standard work hours, but usually home in the evening unless there's an event/meeting at school. Usually when grandma is resisting going to bed, my dad already needs to be in bed sleeping for work the next morning.

TL;DR: my grandma  with dementia/mobility issues now lives with my parents but is difficult to care for. Worried about the toll it will take on my parents, but mostly my mom who is the primary caregiver.

Thank you!",1646510335.0

t7hdar,Are southerners just more uptight about a lot of things than people who live up north?,,0,0.5,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7hdar/are_southerners_just_more_uptight_about_a_lot_of/,2,"My experience may seem weird to you because I come from a line of extremely old fashioned, hyper religious, anti-tech isolationist types. We're talking to people who want to live as if it's the Victorian age. But some of these attitudes that I'm familiar with seemed fairly common in the deep rural south where I spent most of my life than they do up north which is where I am now.

I was surprised by how laid-back people up here are about cleanliness. I'm a slightly messy person which has been made worse by a roommate who completely tore out place up. But my messiness which was something like maybe a dirty pair of pj's on the floor, some clutter and an unmade bed is apparently not that bad. My mom likes the house looking like no one lives there at all. That means that if there's so much as a dirty sock on the ground, the hamper is visible instead of being hidden away in the closet, or there is a dirty coffee mug in the sink and nothing else that it's the end of the world. But I've had quite a few guests because I like to host fun events when I can and apparently my place is pretty average. Some even say they wish their roommates were as clean as me.

They also seem to be more lenient in standards of modesty. When I'm sick or sometimes just when I have a day off, I'd lounge around the house in my pajamas as a teen. My mom was horrified by this practice, very pearl-clutchy and when she stopped by my house on my day off and saw me answer the door to get the stuff from Instacart I'd ordered earlier barefoot and in my PJs (loose t shirt and pajama pants) she exclaimed, ""Have a little shame! You let a stranger see you practically naked! I didn't raise you like this!""

And yet up here (though certainly not down there where covering all but your face and hands for females and maybe your arms for males at all times unless sleeping or bathing was frowned upon) I see college students going to class in pajamas, or people even stumbling into the speedway I work at in PJs. I see girls in short skirts and halter tops. I see men jogging outside wearing only shorts in the summer.  And when a male friend of mine stopped by to drop off a pair of headphones I left at his place and caught me with messy hair, barefoot, pajamas it wasnt made into a big mortifying social faux pas I could never live down and for that I'm grateful. Oh yeah. And being barefoot in your own home isn't considered to be weird or immodest which is great because I hate wearing shoes.

Even those in long term relationship, say that they still don't feel like they're ready.

I've also been to a bunch of parties, but unlike in the movies, no one is ever doing anything more than kissing, with a sneaky bj or two here and there.

It's not even like anyone's trying to hide it. People openly talk about how they're virgins in school, and how 80-90% of our year is as well. 

I even went to the bother of asking my brother this, and he said that it's not like in the movies at all. That most people don't do it in high school.

But when u watch any high school movie, or even look at the stats its always talking about people usually lose their virginities in high school. Is this just an american thing? Or is my school just wonky.",1646494506.0

Let me describe you what i mean, i always buyed slippery elm from indigo Herbs, and it was always real good, but since oct 2020 the quality is nonexistent.

I mean slippery elm has to be thick and slimey right?But this time it was like water with sand on the ground, wenn i was done mixing it. 

So i tried another batch from the same company and again the same bad quality. 

I thought, maybe this company sucks now, so i tried some others and guess what? The same Bad quality form EVERY Company that i buyed. I tried companys like Now Foods but always the same bad Quality.

I am sick of it, to waste Money to buy literally nothing.I even tried to drink this ""Slippery Elm"" anyway hoping it has the same Effect even if it was like water with sand.

Let me tell you Guys the effect on the stomach is like actually water with Sand, you can imagine how disgutsing it is and how bad your stomach would respond to it.

Why is there no real Slippery Elm anymore?Has anyone the Answer to this? Its seems to me like everybody has the same Supplier, and the Supplier are scamming these Companys? i dont know

Please can someone give me a link or tell me a real good slippery elm ? Maybe one that i can order even from Germany?

t7aq99,How are stocks actually valuable?,Unanswered,2,1.0,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7aq99/how_are_stocks_actually_valuable/,6,"From some googling I've seen a few explanations but they don't seem that convincing.

1. Dividend yields i.e company profits get distributed based on share ownership.

First issue here is that not all companies offer yields on shares (eg. Amazon, one of the highest valued shares). Second, when they do, the yields don't seem that significant. 3% is considered high. There has to be other investments with comparable returns and less risk right?

2. Voting and management rights

Problem here is, owning a share doesn't get your seat at the management table. 
You need to own a very significant portion of the shares. If it's already a highly valued company, there's not gonna be many people in the world that can buy enough shares to get a seat at the table, and of those people, fewer still will even want to. So there really can't be much demand on the stock in this respect.

3. Equity upon dissolving

Probably the most sensible argument but actually the least mentioned. If the company closes up shop/dissolves, owning company shares nets you a portion of the assets left behind after all debts and obligations are settled.
But if a company is doing well, acquiring lots of assets, and it's stock is therefore going up, why would it ever close up shop? How can the investor expect to gain here? 
 If it's performance then did a turn around, (now the stock is dropping and the company is doomed), I'd imagine it would actually expend assets to try and survive.",1646490948.0

t7es6u,"Is it possible that a impossibility to use compromise path in a correct way, lies inside of how human body functions?",,0,0.33,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7es6u/is_it_possible_that_a_impossibility_to_use/,0,"This is my answer for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t6syaq/what_is_wrong_with_compromise_path_as_a_solution/) post.

So, from my experience, when I have tried to solve various problems in my life by usage ""compromise path"", I came across some phenomena inside, that make impossible to get solution in such way.

E.g. let's imagine that I want to find ""ideal shoes"" to buy. I can start with getting some knowledge in this field (read ""how to choose shoes"" articles). Then I look on available variants. E.g. some shoe\_1, and shoe\_2 (for simplicity let it be only two). Then, let such happen that I can't choose straight away between two, because of pluses and minuses of the two. E.g. shoe\_1 is more expensive (-), have better quality (+), looks slightly strange (- for personal safety), and somehow not so comfortable (-).  Shoe\_2 is less expensive (+), less quality - so can fall apart for a half a year (-), looks just fine (+) and are really comfortable (+).

So next, when trying to choose quickly we can fall in to ""vicious circle"". E.g. I can think that most important is comfort, and choose shoe\_2, but then I don't want to buy another one after half a year and I really want just better quality. So I jump to shoe\_1. But then I begin to worry about comfort and safety and again fall to shoe\_2, and so on.

This ""vicious circle"" is manifestation of one of such phenomena. And looking ahead, problem is with reaction of a human body (brain and hormones) to moving forward ""way too comfort point"".

So, from my experience when trying to solve some problem, when you meet various subproblems and try to find compromised point between such ""parameters"". When so, (next thing will sound really strange), something inside ""need to manifest in some form"" and there no other condition. Figuratively thinking, I call this thing ""the flow"".

Flow can manifest (show itself) in the two next phenomena (there more of them). -1- When you have some problem and try to find some ""technical solution"" (e.g. invent something) (technical problem). -2- When you try to solve problem by pushing yourself through something emotionally hard (""emotional problem"").

You can ask why I have never felt ""flow"" inside - this is because ""flow"" is usually manifested in those usual effects that we used to see inside.

E.g. with shoes. Trying to get out from ""vicious circle"", we can try to find shoe that have all ""+"" and dont have no ""-"", mentioned above. This will be ""stuck with technical problem"". Or we can think ""I will have to sacrifice with something"", and try to pass through ""pressure inside"" of not ""overlayed minuses"" that present in chosen variant. This will be ""stuck with emotional problem"".

And I will say, that usually brain jumps (flow jumps) between this two effects (stuck points).

Next, from my experience, when I solve (went through) ""technical problem"" or ""emotional problem"", then I have met more and more of such problem. There no way out in a such way.

To get from this ""vicious circle"", to choose finally one variant, and go through doubts that left, people need to become more conscious and have some self control,  and somehow manage to act and move forward in presence of this all thought and stimulus inside (I think that classical Zen is the fastest way to achieve this).

But when you manage to disconnect ""flow"" (or ""put your brain from"") from this two effects, it start to connect to other things (inside) that left. And what is available is the next effects (next goes even more weird things). A,and I will not list all, but few. So: -a1- state of hyperemotionality, when you literally cant choose between variants, because of milion of ""pluses"" and ""minuses"" that appear in the head, and you usually start to be upset and angry and quarrel with people around you. E.g. in such state I one day couldn't end up something on my job, I literally couldn't get from this state. -a2- Burn out state - hyper exhaustion, lost of thoughts in the head. This is where I stuck when I have managed to path through all fenomena that I met previously (on my past job). ""Flow need to appear somehow"".

What is very bad, that all this effects were not present when I have quarreled with people around me, this like ""flow"" in such time pointed forward on other people. But being peaceful man, I avoid to point my ""flow"" on others and stuck in those effects.

Last part. I went very long and hard path to find how to move forward to something better, avoid to make suffer other people, and not stuck with that affects.  I have discovered that flow need to be ""pressed down"" inside the body, and it must not be went to the head (sound strange, but there really something inside like this). And current way to do so, that I use, is ""limit yourself in movement for the better, from above"", and ""incomplete following"" of your thought and stimulus inside. And just to choose, feel, what paths have that all effects mentioned above, and avoid them.

E.g. and explanation. ""Limit yourself in movement for the better, from above"", keep yourself one step before things that you really like and want, your ""best things"". E.g. put away those shoes that really better one and look what is left (most better what is left). ""Incomplete following"" - is when you follow the thoughts that you have in your head incompletely, not finish to the ideal state what you do (again - one step before ideal things). E.g. think of various parameters of shoes, but look only on few of them, other just put away. Or, check for how shoe is comfortable or not, but check not completely, not ideally, so doubts must left.

So in such way ""flow"" is pressed down and not ""hit the head"". And if you also avoid paths with ""too hard technical problems"" and ""too hard emotional problems"". In such way you can move forward and not stuck on that effects, and not to bring harm to others (not point ""flow"" on to other people).

And last thing, believe me, the state when you found solution to some problem and you feel yourself happy about this - this really bad state, because, this is when ""flow"" reach the head. And state when you feel some unknown bad feeling inside with no reason - this is right state. Because ""flow"" can't reach the head and fall down to bottom.

\----------------------------------------------

This effects will really appear near serious problems like war conflicts and other. When too much pressure inside. What do you think about this all - nonsense, or you have seen something in your experience.

I and many others are hunters. We only have Full Metal Jacket ammo for practice, and most of us are fairly well equipped with soft-points, hollow-points, and ballistic tipped bullets for all sorts of hunting. 

If we defend our country - as private citizens - from someone who's trying to kill us, and happen to use ammunition that's highly destructive, are we breaching some sort of law? 

I acknowledge that the chances of us making it more than five minutes are probably slim - I just want to know whether taking someone's leg off instead of poking a hole through it will turn the marksman into a war criminal.",1646502450.0

t7e4eq,Autonomy and Vasectomies,,1,0.67,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t7e4eq/autonomy_and_vasectomies/,10,"Bodily autonomy is defined as “the right to make decisions over one’s own life and future” by the UNFPA. 

According to Samuel J. Ujewe, there are four major concepts of Autonomy: Self-Individual Autonomy, Autonomy as Self-Rule, Autonomy as Free Will, and Rational Autonomy. Self-Individual Autonomy relates to the idea of freedom and that you are responsible for yourself. Autonomy as Self-Rule has two parts. The first part says that you are the main decision maker in your decisions and the second part of this autonomy is contingent on the fact that the decisions that you make do not affect others. Autonomy as Free Will says that whichever decision you made was made without any external influencing factors. Lastly, Rational Autonomy relates to the person in question’s mental capability to understand, self-criticize, and reflect upon your decisions. 

My question: How do vasectomies affect a woman’s bodily autonomy? To get a vasectomy, married males do not legally need the approval of their wives to have the procedure. From this, we can say that the male getting the vasectomy has patient autonomy because he is making an informed decision about what procedure he wants to be done to his body. At the same time, however, isn’t the woman’s autonomy being affected? As mentioned above, Autonomy as Self-Rule encompasses the idea that your decision is not affecting anyone else. Hence, if the husband did not have a conversation with his wife and decided to get a vasectomy, he has patient autonomy. If the husband also knows that his wife would not agree to the procedure, yet went ahead either way, her autonomy is being affected. 

What is the right thing to do here? What do you think?

The admissions requirement is: TOEFL with a minimum score of 577 (paper-based) / 90 (internet-based). I have no clue what this means but a quick Google search seems to imply that you only need B2. Note: the university is in a non-English speaking country and the requirement to enroll in local language programs is either a C1 University or C2 certificate. 

In one course, we were put into groups at the beginning of the semester and then given a list of assignments to do together. The assignments are generally a list of questions based on the lecture/readings and my group has been splitting the questions amongst ourselves and then meeting to discuss and finalize them. Of my group, half of the people have not great English skills and it's incredibly frustrating because I, a native English speaker, end up basically doing all of their work on top of my own. 

What I mean by ""not great English skills:"" one person is generally pretty quiet but when they do say something, it usually makes zero sense in the context of what we're talking about (in all fairness, their writing is pretty good but they don't fully answer their question). With another person, I just delete what they wrote and start from scratch because it's faster than trying to correct all of their mistakes. The third person is the most frustrating: Every single meeting they come in with nothing and say ""I have a doubt about my question."" The group will discuss but this person won't contribute anything to the conversation until we've already reached a conclusion, at which point they'll pipe up with ""I don't agree; this is my idea."" Will they defend their idea or explain how they got there or continue discussing with us? Of course not but you can bet your butt that that's what they're putting on the assignment. Their idea is normally wrong, by the way, and I delete it and answer with the answer the group agreed on. 

We had a planning call last week to discuss when/how we're going to do the rest of the assignments. One person spent the entire 45 minutes repeating the same question no less than five times (it was the third person; they kept asking about what we had left to do on an unfinished assignment and the thing that's missing *is their goddamn question*).

Would it be overstepping some sort of boundary if I were to make her a painting of the dog? 

It'd be a moderately photorealistic depiction, though there'd probably be a mistake or two. I'm not bad at painting, but I'm also still a student and have been consistently improving still with places to go. It'd be something I'd put my best effort into, at least. 

I just know that there's a lot of emotion involved at the time, and I'd hate for it to come across like I'm offering a sort of parting gift on behalf of the dog. Or like, a replacement.

The TLDR is that every time we see Mark for more than 5 minutes, that night he suddenly likes a bunch of my wife's old Facebook photos. I think he's making an oblique pass at my wife, my wife disagrees. 

The context. So Lucy has this best friend since middle school named Kathy. Kathy and Matt have been together since highschoo and are now married with a couple of kids. All the people involved went to the same high-school including me but I'm the oldest and graduated the year before my wife's little sister and her friends became freshmen. Because Lucy got married last year we've been at a bunch of events where we have spent time with Mark and Kathy. The weird thing is that every time Mark sees my wife, later that night he randomly likes a bunch of her old photos from high-school and college on Facebook. My wife was a senior in high-school when he was a freshman and doesn't remember him but he has made a point of saying he remembers her. As far as we were concerned we more or less met him the first time a year and a half ago at an engagement party for Lucy at his house. 

I think he must have had a secret crush on my wife in high-school and is trying to subtly tell her that he is lingering over her photos late at night. She thinks it's weird but probably nothing. We saw them again yesterday at a celebration dinner for Lucy and even joked about the picture thing on the way home. Sure enough 5 new pictures were hearted this morning.

If a cat is agressive enough too my god their bites can be so deep and painful, even dangerous.

So why do some cat owners encourage this behaviour in their pets?",1646468136.0

But I’m also forgetful.. and yesterday rent was due, I forgot and a $50 late fee was tacked on. Would it be fair to ask if he would split the late fee with me?

I just figure since we both signed the lease we’re both responsible for the rent. He sits back and never has to worry about bill due dates, just assumes I’ll handle it I guess, I’m the one to always deal with that, so if I happen to forget it just seems off that I have to pay for it?

When I was a kid I used to be super scared and shake when going to the movies because the screen was so big and the posters were huge. I'm fine with the screens now but the posters still get me. And I would always get sick and dizzy looking up at the sky.

I went to Sydney a few years ago and it was one panic attack after another (or I think that's what they were at least). I went to a bigger church than I've been to before and I felt crushed by the weight of the open air above me, forcing me downwards, but I also had to hold onto one of the columns to feel like I wasn't going to float away. Then when I went to the opera house in the night, it took everything I had to cross the open area to reach it, I was trembling and had to do it with my eyes closed. When I got in, the walls were mostly windows and high ceilings, and the ocean water and night sky blended into each other, I had a straight up panic attack as I was hunched into a corner holding onto a bin. When I got into the theatre, I was terrified, the only thing that helped was that the guy next to me was overweight and spilling into my seat so it helped me feel grounded. And when I saw how big the Sydney bridge was, I just felt.loke collapsing. It was all so stupid, and yet somehow I've never been that scared in my life until then.

I thought it was just agoraphobia, but looking into it, it seems like that's more about social anxiety than open space- I know I have that also, because I find it really hard to leave the house on my own and sometimes in crowds, but not sure what this whole experience was anymore. Is it still considered agoraphobia or am I falling for ""the myth"" that agoraphobia is just about open spaces and have something else?",1646483249.0

Because as animals were not really long term focussed, more short term because back in those days you would be living day to day, there wouldn’t be long term planning. So it got me thinking was practice really a thing back then because of this, or did they even know that the more you do something the better you get? Because I can imagine an early human being confused at the concept. 

So I guess I have two questions. Was practice a totally foreign concept to them?

Does this kill these young athletes' careers? As an association football fan, it's unimaginable that a world-class talent would go to some shit-tier side, because even though they may get a more playing minutes (which is where the loan system comes in), the shitness of the rest of the team will invariably prevent them from showing their true talent - both sports are team sports after all, and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Careers are made and legends are born in great teams.

I know the rules of American football. I watch it occasionally, mostly college games outside of the Superbowl. I feel like the college system is closer to our football leagues here in Europe, which may be the reason why I'm drawn to it over the NFL?

I like how the draft serves as a balancing system to prevent strong teams becoming stronger and helping weak teams (socialism!?), but considering that some teams stay shit and others stay strong, it does seem like a tough break for the best players, and makes me wonder why student athletes don't tactically take their foot off the gas to avoid being landed with a crappy team.",1646478572.0

They then said I was ""rent responsible"" for 2 months of rent and wanted me to pay $4800 to extend my lease by 2 months at the new, increased price, that is further increased because it's a ""2 month lease""

Complete BS.

Good new, they sent a notice of their rent increase 8 days later than my lease said they would, and according to my lawyer, it made that fee null & void. The building agreed to this.

A big thing here is that my lease actually said I would ACTUALLY be responsible for 1 month of rent, not 2, even though they needed a 2 month notice. Even if they sent me a notice on time.

What I'm wondering is: Am I able to sue them for money because they tried to send me a bill not in accordance with my contract? Like, am I able to get some sort of payout because they broke some law?",1646445523.0

Before I lost my job due to the pandemic, I drank every Thursday. This day was chosen carefully, because it was one of the least busy days at my work. I worked at a movie theater, so Thursdays were quite uneventful. It was easier to request all Thursdays off since they can get by with a skeleton crew most of the time. It also allowed me to keep Fridays - which can be quite busy - open, and being hungover for those shifts was just an added bonus, as I find myself to be much more outgoing when hungover.

Once I lost my job, I switched to Fridays because the noise curfew in my parents' house was increased by one hour on those days, since my school-going siblings didn't have school the next day. 

All told, I've been drinking once a week on the same day for 4 years. For 2 years I drank every Thursday, and for another 2 I drank every Friday.

I consider these once-a-week drinking sessions to be a form of ""binge drinking"", although that depends on the definition. I may not drink to the extent of other people, but I do spend most of the day drinking. Since I have no obligations, I'll start drinking at around noon and I'll continue drinking until 2 or 3am, at which point I'll smoke a bowl or two and binge eat before passing out. 

Drinking once a week doesn't seem out of the ordinary for a 25 year old like myself, but there are other factors involved. For one, if for some reason I can't drink on my assigned day, I become quite upset. I will do anything I can to get any potential familial/interpersonal obligations moved to a different day. In my 4 years of drinking on the same day every week, I've only had to deviate from that day a handful of times. There were plenty of times that my family tried to organize something, or my job asked me to take an extra shift, but I refused because it's my drinking day. There isn't any shame in my drinking, because my family all know by now that Fridays are drinking days. Don't expect Daniel to do anything on a Friday. If you're organizing a family event and want Daniel to attend, don't schedule it for a Friday. Clearly, I make no effort to hide my drinking from my family.

On the rare occasion when I need to be sober on a Friday due to circumstances outside of my control, it is certainly upsetting. I've had to go as long as two weeks without my Friday due to moving and not being able to have a Friday available. If something important is happening on a Friday, I'm not gonna disregard it in order to have my Friday. Similarly, my drinking never got in the way of my work, because my job was very good with scheduling. If I request Fridays off due to (insert reason here), I'll never have to worry about working a Friday, allowing me to drink on those days with no issue. Even now I consider myself to be a relatively functional person, despite being unemployed. 

Alcohol doesn't interfere with my life because I've integrated it into my life. I don't expect I would meet enough of the DSM criteria to be considered an ""alcoholic"", simply because I've insolated my drinking from my functional life very well, and the DSM weighs interference with work and relationships heavily in their criteria. I have absolutely no doubt that I'm mentally dependent on alcohol, even if it hasn't affected my functioning in more ""important"" aspects of daily living. 

That's the definition of a ""functional alcoholic"", is it not? Hell, my grandparents drank heavily every single day but managed to hold steady, high-paying jobs. At that point, who's to say they weren't ""functional""? 

(Except for my mother, who they routinely beat while intoxicated. She might have something to say about their level of function.)",1646461394.0

Why does he do this? Why does he want to? He leaves his father (granted, he didn't care for him) and his little sister, who he clearly cares very much for, to... what? Join the military? He tells his father ""I need to see this"".

So, is he just a 16 year old who sees a real life Call of Duty mission unfolding before his eyes and thinks ""now's my chance!""? Is there anybody who actually empathizes with his position? If I was involved in a worldwide invasion by aliens, I would not eschew sticking with my loved ones to ""see this"" like it's some sort of spectacle. I sincerely hope I'm not alone in this.

What is Robbie's motivation for completely abandoning his family during a doomsday event, aside from needing to ""see this""? I initially thought it was an overwhelming sense of duty to his country - or indeed, the human race - but his comment about needing to see this makes it seem like he just wants to see shit go down.

Sometimes I am the one narrating my success story. Sometimes other characters are gossiping about my success.

do i have a higher tolerance now after only 1 day of using such high amount? also i dont encourage you to do this bc large doses of caffine do have side effects which can be uncomfortable for some ppl",1646473249.0

As we rather don't eat carnivores in today's world, it makes me curious, is there any real problem with that? Maybe it's the higher risk of parasites and viruses like rabies? Or maybe something in chemical composition of the meat changes on carnivorous diet?

I do not necessarily mean only meat, but a diet of fruits, vegetables and meat in equal proportions. How would that affect structure and taste of meat?

She also says the bites make her itchy and I often catch her scratching around her ankles and her scalp. 

She had a really rough day this past week (unrelated to the gnats) and I offered to come over during my lunch hour to try and offer some support. I went to her apartment for the first time ever and was kinda shocked when I didn’t see a single gnat. 

To be fair she is older and a little quirky, but I wouldn’t call her crazy. She can take care of herself and is in relatively good health for her age. She doesn’t have a ton of friends or any family so she’s really independent.

I’m wondering if there’s any explanation for the itching.. Are biting gnats a real thing that google and I didn’t know about? Am I being naive in thinking that she isn’t a little crazy?

There are billions of examples of how  timing affects meaning of anything. Timing of when things are sent, and when things are received, etc. 


Timing affects meaning in words, but timing also affects meaning in all of the other many many modes of communication that don't only use words.

Are there any linguistic nerds here that knows of videos and other good sites that lists all of the other factors that affects and determines meaning?




Interpretation also has a determining effect on meaning. 

The biggest part of interpretation is very very likely their background and the immense biases that most, but not all people have. How the limited perceptions and limited knowledge of a person affects and clouds the lens of their interpretation (of anything)

Looking for good videos and other good sites that lists all of the other factors that affects and determines meaning, and also shows many examples of how those factors affects meaning. Am not a good writer, or explainer, and don't like teaching, and am sure lots of linguistics people and others have written all of this out somewhere already, and am just looking for where those places are so can see them

Fast food worker, cashier, lab coordinator, math tutor, barista, lab assistant, wearhouse unloader, part-time teacher, office administrator, baker, general laborer... I could go on. In total, I've applied to 55 separate locations--yes, I've counted. Maybe that's not a lot in the grand scheme of things, and admittedly, I probably could've tried a bit harder to find a job after I initially resigned from my teaching job, but I honestly didn't think that it would be *this* hard to find a new one. I dunno, I'm a stupid kid, I guess. But, I'm afraid that if I can't find a new one soon, then I literally won't have any way to provide for myself or my family. I need help, so I'm hoping that I can get some advice here.

What's especially frustrating is that about 70% of these locations simply ghost me and about 20% decline to hire me without providing a single reason why! The remaining 10% interview me, tell me that I sound like a promising candidate and that they will reach out with more information in the next few business days, and then they just...never follow up!! Like, if I had a bad resume or a bad interview or whatever, then that's a problem that I could identify and adjust, but given that every potential employer that I've spoken to thus far has given me basically nothing to work with, I really don't know what to do here...

Idk, maybe this is dumb. Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough, but it doesn't hurt to ask, I guess.

Oh, and I live in America, btw. Maybe that's relevant.",1646459114.0

i know the exact location of the apartment and if i could get in the building, or ask someone to go inside and tell me the number of the apartment, i would be able to talk to the person i want to, but the apartment number is not deductible by it’s location (the building is irregular) and ring every single apartment until i reach the person is not an option.

what would you say to some random person from the building to convince it to come downstairs and talk to you, so you can explain this situation? here where i live, the people are conditioned to be arrogant and short in words to avoid much contact with someone outside their residence, so they’ll hung up on me as soon as they can if i don’t convince them. i would need to be very polite and use the right words, but i don’t know how.",1646458713.0

I worry they might take money out of there out of anger. 
I’ve been meaning to transfer money out of there into a new account and close it but was worried about it affecting my credit score. 

I think not because it’s checking (debit) but can’t be too sure. It’s also my oldest account

I know this will come up so, for the record- I can’t remove the person because they are not an ‘authorized user’. This account was created years ago when I was under 16, so it has both mine and my parent’s name on it. I am worried because he has previously pulled from my account to pay his bills and such (without notice) and we were not struggling financially enough for me to have to work to support my family. Which would be fine, but he doesn’t communicate with me and just uses my account sometimes, hence me not trusting him and wanting to close it now

He and I initially wanted a purely sexual relationship, we had sex twice the first month we knew each other. I didn’t enjoy the sex at all, it was traumatic and I wasn’t ready for it like I thought I was after a predatory relationship 3 years ago. I suggested to him that we get to know each other better first, and then decide if we wanted to have sex or not. 

We became normal friends and did stuff for about a month, and he told me that although he didn’t think we were compatible as a couple and agreed with me that we shouldn’t have sex again, he wanted to stay in my life as a normal friend. I agreed wholeheartedly, and we have been normal friends with no sex for 4 months now. 

Sometimes, he’ll put his arm around me if we’re sitting next to each other. I don’t mind this, and I feel like this is not out of bounds for friends. It’s rare this even happens to begin with, and it’s never in public. He has had several sexual partners since last having sex with me, and I have had one. If neither of us want to date or even have sex, and we regret the sex we did have, then I’m pretty sure I’m single so what is the problem?",1646486818.0

Like for example back then it was probably Normal to get married at 8-12 as a girl to a guy in his 20’s (I think). Now the age has increased to 18 now which is todays norm. But some now even argue that 18 is super young for someone to date a person in the 30s since they just got out of high school. To me I think 18 - 21 age limits will stay the same. 

Biggest one would be about racism or offensive jokes, it used to be big on vine and big on Tv I’m assuming, but now people are getting cancelled and offended everywhere. And this was just like in less than 10 years.

Or abuse is a big one. I don’t think it was normal to, but I think it was a lot bigger back then at least within 20-30 sum years where parents would hit their kids or get the “belt.” And that was something in my opinion no one would say is abuse 15-10 years ago.",1646452522.0

t6syaq,What is wrong with compromise path as a solution to conflicts?,,3,0.8,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t6syaq/what_is_wrong_with_compromise_path_as_a_solution/,18,"Greeting. I am from Ukraine (Western part). Now there is war here. I am not in war front now, but will be in near future (as I predict).

I am not some fake account person, please check my profile for this.

So, what is concerning me is the question - ""what is wrong with path of compromise"". Compromise between Russian government and what want people of Ukraine.

As I see how war began, is that people of Ukraine wanted same as other people - better future for themselves and their children's. And they chose best from what is available. To move toward NATO (better safety for our country) and to EU (better economical possibility).

But such happened, that this things really disturb Russian government. There was words that ""If Ukraine will be in NATO, than Russia will have to fight with NATO (because of Crimea, and than definitely will begin WW3)"", and other.

People of Ukraine, and our government, are really fearless, and move toward this goal despite of military resistance of Russia.

And now I will say, really unpopular thoughts (and I think I will have trouble because of this, but how it is). And what is interesting this things is unpopular as in Ukraine, and also in Russia, because everyone wants something for their own (I think). From my experience, better is to avoid conflicts, and not move blindly in its direction. **Avoid conflict, but still move to chosen goals, and move strong.** And to decrease conflict, there is ""compromise"".

So, despite of trustees of what Russian government saying, we clearly see that chosen by us path is determined their war response. And is it wise to ""push forward"" closing eyes on this. Yes we can win, but does we get again in such way ""progress on blood"" (how such happened a lot of time in history)?

Our Ukrainian government can set what they want and what they afraid of(e.g. we want more safety for our country, we will not give even small part of Ukraine, and so on). Then, need to be set different pathes how to achieve this (e.g. move toward NATO, or to neutral status, but other countries will help us to gain such military power and create such condition that we will not need NATO (why Switzerland is not a part of the European Union or NATO, and still it have really good protection)). The, Russian government will look on to this variants and for each will say ""what they want and what they afraid of"" (e.g. they don't want that NATO move toward Russia borders, and they definitely don't want to be with ruined economy because of sanctions (I think), or they afraid of Nuclear war). And then we Ukraine, and Russia, we will begin of what I call ""pulling the rope"". This is when every part will try to get more of what we want and get away of what we afraid. We can try to find or/and invent such solutions, when both of us will be happy, with some ""feasible concessions"".

So what is wrong with search of compromise, and to rest on each other's limitations, invent and search for better paths. E.g., such ""fantastic"" solution of that Russia may want more territory, but really no one will give it, - let's start ""space colonization program"".Let's have some tragic events there, heroic death there, and spent a lot of money there and not on war.

But, I need to warn, that this ""peace path"" will have it's price. From my experience, progress, movement to better place, still need to have some bad things, some sacrifices, but let's find another path to progress than torment and kill each other. As peace person I had in life my own hell, price that I paid for this. May be it is right time for this, until it's too late.

Ah, and also for this compromise we must apply some ugly amount of self control.
