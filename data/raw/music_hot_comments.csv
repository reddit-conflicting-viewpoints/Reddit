And that can always be commodified and sold. Anger towards establishment sells and in itself (because it's about feelings of the individual) doesn't pose any threat towards the capitalist system. 

There is ""protest"" in music, but it simply doesn't lead anywhere. It remains as an aesthetic. Words don't transform into action. Nobody is trying to do uprising because of songs. Art doesn't push people into action. It only pushes people to consume and make more art. The link between collective action and art doesn't exist. You can be a CEO and fan of Rage Against the Machine at the same time. Often the ""radical"" artists are the favorite of the elites; they go to festivals and events funded by the billionaires who want to experience something exciting. But it's all a show. There is never real revolutionary action involved.

Anything by Philip Glass.The most extreme case I know is *Etude Nr. 10*, where the bass part is one chord repeated throughout the whole piece.

If you can get the scores, it will make it visual clear.

Frank Zappa also uses a lot of ostinato, but it's kinda hidden in most songs. A good clear example is *Watermelon in Easter Hay*.

In modern music I think any techno song will do, and most of hiphop, for both bass and rhythm.

Bassline of *I Feel Love* by Donna Summer / Giorgio Moroder.

It‚Äôs called Joik and it‚Äôs the traditional style of singing from the indigenous Sami people of Northern Finland/Norway/Sweden.

If you don't select this one this time at least please listen.  You will use it at some point, I'd almost guarantee it.   ""Circles"" by Greta Svabo Bech [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELiG9g9BBfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELiG9g9BBfE)  The singer is from the Faroe Islands.

t6s6sg,hzdl2fb,t3_t6s6sg,"I consider ""Classic Rock"" to be an era of rock within rock history, not simply a description of whatever rock the previous generation to a person, listened to.

Rock from the mid 60s to the 80s is classic rock (Pink Floyd, The Doors, Rolling Stones, Zeppelin, Queen, Black Sabbath etc.) 

Around the 80s it starts diversifying into more genres like Hard Rock, Hair Metal, Metal (Metallica, Poison, Aerosmith, Twisted Sister, Alice Cooper, AC/DC, Guns n Roses, Motley Crue, Van Halen etc.)

Then the 90s was grunge rock, industrial and some punk (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Green Day, NIN, Smashing Pumpkins, Chili Peppers etc.)

New Rock was the early 2000s (Nickelback, Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Linkin Park, Blink-182, SOAD, Evanescence etc.)

2010s? I don't know many big rock bands from the 2010s. New Rock bands after 2010 don't see to be lighting up the music world the way rock once did. Hip-hop, RnB, electronic genres of many styles and pop are still big but rock seems to be fading. Could just be I'm not as connected to rock culture as I once was or the business end of it (labels, radio, streaming etc.) has decided to reduce its investment in rock.

Each of these eras has a unique sound, song writing style and production feel, though. The band Gretta Van Fleet (2010s) is notable by thier similarity to the sounds of Classic Rock, Led Zeppelin specifically. Which is almost a retro rebirth of the Classic Rock sound.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

No, they have been gleefully opening their doors for as small a fee as possible, sometimes for free, to let as many people see it as possible.

Bandcamp's payout model is great but the service itself has lagged behind by decades. It is just not good for discovery and has done very little to improve the storefront.

IF this is actually just a platform investment to expand Epics online presence, this may be a great thing - bandcamp will finally have resources to improve and make the platform easier to use. 

It is too early to tell if the payout model will change. If it doesn't, there is no issue. I don't care if the front page becomes flooded with Fortnite songs  as long as it has a decent recommendation engine.

Also for anyone who is knee-jerking:

> Bandcamp will operate as a standalone marketplace and music community, and it will continue to be led by CEO and co-founder Ethan Diamond.

Your cries for the death of bandcamp are unwarranted right now. Until there is an actual, tangible change in the platform it's just speculation.

Games from scratch did a video on this acquisition and stated that all of their previous acquisitions so far have either benefited or remained the same.

I know people are nervous, but this might not be a bad thing. It could give Bandcamp a jolt of money to develop better services. May even integrate an option for artists to sell their music for indie game use. I'm not familiar with the platform so I'm spitballing.

""Happiness in Slavery"", ""Gave Up"", and ""Wish"" should be considered all-time classics. The vocals are absolutely *ripped* from Reznor's throat. It's a hateful, bitter, raw collection of tracks that nothing NIN's done since even comes close to in terms of unbridled emotional rage. And yet most people don't even seem to know it exists.

Zappa released 62 albums in his lifetime and 60 more have been released. Zappa was a iconoclast. Nothing was sacred. 

His music was unyielding. He took control of his time and output. He'd released what he liked and if you liked it too, great. The variety of genres that Zappa covered was impressive. Doo-wop, psychedelic, rock, jazz, fusion, classical, R&B, C&W, rap, blues and chamber. 

The musicians are played for Zappa were impressive. George Duke, Aynsley Dunbar, Dr. John, Terry Bozzio, Dale Bozzio, Vinnie Colaiuta, Eddie Harris, Jeff Beck, Tina Turner and the Ikettes, Chester Thompson and more.

Prince was more overlooked as a singer, writer, and actor than he ever was as an instrumentalist. As him being a vocalist at work, Prince had the most diverse and amazing vocal range I ever heard. He could even hit higher Mariah Carey style notes in his music and live performances (watch his performance of Gotta Broken Heart live from the One Nite Alone tour). MC could literally never! 

At the same time though, I'm not a fan of crazy, over-the-top, typical high note voices you hear from every singer, but I can tolerate Prince's high, falsetto-y, screaming notes. They could be used as a perfect alarm clock noise for my phone.

t67erk,hzbd39k,t3_t67erk,"Having similar problems, there's no real way to fix this. The key here is 'basically'.

Example: a song can be roughly 120 bpm, but there's no guarantee that it's spot on 120, so if you 

a) don't start the song exactly at the beat, it will go off after a while  
b) if it's not exactly 120 it will go off no matter what  
c) if it's not electronic music with quantized beats, the tempo will not be consistent troughout the song (which I consider likely since this is Radiohead)

There's a good chance a song got recorded at exactly 120, but during producing they decide to change the tempo a bit. So now it's like 119.65223, good luck finding that out by yourself.

No Hoard of Value has been simply recorded too early for that. Lyrics seem to be more like another take on ""you load 16 tons"". 

It could still be political for the time, as it was the time when political pendulum swung back and pro-Russian government has been elected, having highest support in the eastern regions. And they robbed the country blind, to the level never seen before. Then they needed more money, which Russia was ready to provide for political trade-offs, which went against the election promises, which kicked off the protests at the end of 2013.

But if the band had this idea behind the song, then I don't think they would brush off the question about war in the 2019 interview that I've mentioned. Perhaps they were not comfortable talking about it or something.

Home Back does seem to reflect on the topic somewhat, but it still seems apolitical to me. It is more about war denying home as a symbol of safety and memories, and having an urge to return. The last paragraph pretty much, this isn't Shakespeare really.

So can't really tell if they did allow themselves time to reflect on how exactly their home has been taken from them.

Devin Townsend his solo work and Devin Townsend Project are both great. He is a super creative and versatile musician, that doesn't take himself too seriously like some prog guys can. He has an album about an alien searching the universe for a perfect cup of coffee, which sounds amazing.


Opeth *Hertiage* onward is pretty mellow from a vocal standpoint, it strays away from their death metal roots, while keeping the great arrangements.


Mastodon, I'd recommend Crack the Skye and after. Their drummer, Brann Dailor, started singing on that album. Which is dedicated to his sister, so you can really feel the emotion in his voice.

An under the radar pick that's very dynamic musically with a lot of screaming-but-like-a-human would be Dawncore's 'Entertainment for the Rest'. It''s a wall to wall riff-fest, very topsy-turvy. There's double-kick used but mostly just for the very intense bits. Lots and lots of screaming but no deep growls if I think you mean what I think you mean.

Pelican's 'Australasia', instrumental. Hypnotically sludgey. Still heavy, just slow in general. But some gorgeous riffs.

Every Time I Die's 'Hot Damn!' is raucous. Lots of screaming but human-like, not like a demon - intelligible. Also hammers riffs out at 1000mph.",1,0,0,False,False,False,1646366805.0

I was always put off by my experience with Pandora, and even presuming a better functioning recommender algorithm there‚Äôs something about personalized music that I dislike.   If I want to listen to  things for just myself, I have an impossibly finely curated library on iTunes that‚Äôs full of my friends‚Äô bands, weird little touring groups I caught at mountain top coffee houses, etc.   

When I want to listen to something beyond that, I want to hear what *other* people value, not necessarily which popular songs would be closest to my personal library.  And I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd be driven mad trying to persuade the algorithm to show me a broad spectrum of popular music (or even tour into a few interesting sub genres), while it‚Äôs actively trying to pin me down to a few favorites.  I know just enough ML to get sucked into trying to game the thing, and pretty soon I‚Äôd be thinking about strategic input rather than, er, music.

On the search option, you can opt for pre-built playlists for specific genres, and from there you can navigate sub-genres.

Of course, much like anything these days, it will curate playlists for you, that you certainly don‚Äôt have to listen to. These are usually in playlists called Daily Mix‚Äôs and will usually (not always) be genre specific for each daily mix.

If you search for specific key words or genres you‚Äôd like to hear you can narrow it down to just playlists that other users have made so it feels more human when it comes to playlist curation.
