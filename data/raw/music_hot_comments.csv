If they’re going through another creative tug-of-war then they’ll probably break up altogether. I don’t see Flea moving forward without Frusciante a third time.

My honest opinion on these two new songs is that they’re just OK and they’re certainly worse than the singles that were released in advance of OHM, IWY and The Getaway.

And that can always be commodified and sold. Anger towards establishment sells and in itself (because it's about feelings of the individual) doesn't pose any threat towards the capitalist system. 

There is ""protest"" in music, but it simply doesn't lead anywhere. It remains as an aesthetic. Words don't transform into action. Nobody is trying to do uprising because of songs. Art doesn't push people into action. It only pushes people to consume and make more art. The link between collective action and art doesn't exist. You can be a CEO and fan of Rage Against the Machine at the same time. Often the ""radical"" artists are the favorite of the elites; they go to festivals and events funded by the billionaires who want to experience something exciting. But it's all a show. There is never real revolutionary action involved. 

But I don't think we should hate artists because of that; they are simply trying telling us their view of the world and individual creativeness is a wonderful thing.

Anything by Philip Glass.The most extreme case I know is *Etude Nr. 10*, where the bass part is one chord repeated throughout the whole piece.

If you can get the scores, it will make it visual clear.

Frank Zappa also uses a lot of ostinato, but it's kinda hidden in most songs. A good clear example is *Watermelon in Easter Hay*.

In modern music I think any techno song will do, and most of hiphop, for both bass and rhythm.

Conversely, I don’t think many bands have fallen off a cliff as quickly and for as long as Metallica.

The other is [this Wardruna and Aurora colab ](https://youtu.be/FnkTuHP9q3o).  Wardruna is great and their whole catalogue is worth thumbing through. They use a lot of historically accurate instruments to create their music so it’s always sounds haunting and other worldly. 

Something else that I’m thinking about is not so much a specific song but a…style of music? It’s called Joik and it’s the traditional style of singing from the indigenous Sami people of Northern Finland/Norway/Sweden.  [Sophia Jannock](https://youtu.be/aPqKAuzo0tk) is probably the most famous person for bringing Joik to mainstream so she’d be a good place to start diving down the rabbit hole.

t6s6sg,hzdl2fb,t3_t6s6sg,"I consider ""Classic Rock"" to be an era of rock within rock history, not simply a description of whatever rock the previous generation to a person, listened to.

Rock from the mid 60s to the 80s is classic rock (Pink Floyd, The Doors, Rolling Stones, Zeppelin, Queen, Black Sabbath etc.) 

Around the 80s it starts diversifying into more genres like Hard Rock, Hair Metal, Metal (Metallica, Poison, Aerosmith, Twisted Sister, Alice Cooper, AC/DC, Guns n Roses, Motley Crue, Van Halen etc.)

Then the 90s was grunge rock, industrial and some punk (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Green Day, NIN, Smashing Pumpkins, Chili Peppers etc.)

New Rock was the early 2000s (Nickelback, Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Linkin Park, Blink-182, SOAD, Evanescence etc.)

2010s? I don't know many big rock bands from the 2010s. New Rock bands after 2010 don't see to be lighting up the music world the way rock once did. Hip-hop, RnB, electronic genres of many styles and pop are still big but rock seems to be fading. Could just be I'm not as connected to rock culture as I once was or the business end of it (labels, radio, streaming etc.) has decided to reduce its investment in rock.

Each of these eras has a unique sound, song writing style and production feel, though. The band Gretta Van Fleet (2010s) is notable by thier similarity to the sounds of Classic Rock, Led Zeppelin specifically. Which is almost a retro rebirth of the Classic Rock sound.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

If we truly value art then individual ownership and exclusivity is not the way forward. Have art galleries been keeping the art and only letting the people who ""invest"" the most in to see it? No, they have been gleefully opening their doors for as small a fee as possible, sometimes for free, to let as many people see it as possible.

t56u36,hz421ea,t3_t56u36,"A lot of knee jerk reactions in here. Unreal engine has an incredibly generous revenue share where they don't ask for money unless your game's gross revenue is more than one million USD. Then it's only 5% of the amount above one million. 

Games from scratch did a video on this acquisition and stated that all of their previous acquisitions so far have either benefited or remained the same.

I know people are nervous, but this might not be a bad thing. It could give Bandcamp a jolt of money to develop better services. May even integrate an option for artists to sell their music for indie game use. I'm not familiar with the platform so I'm spitballing.

I legit do not understand why this EP isn't considered an all-time industrial/metal classic. It spoke to me in ways nothing else did. It's NIN's first release after *Pretty Hate Machine*, and while *The Downward Spiral* is undoubtedly a more mature album, it was *Broken* that that really set NIN's sound. ""Happiness in Slavery"", ""Gave Up"", and ""Wish"" should be considered all-time classics. The vocals are absolutely *ripped* from Reznor's throat. It's a hateful, bitter, raw collection of tracks that nothing NIN's done since even comes close to in terms of unbridled emotional rage. And yet most people don't even seem to know it exists.

Frank Zappa is the musician who will always be my favorite. Lennon and Yoko joined Frank on stage June of 71 at the Fillmore East.

Zappa released 62 albums in his lifetime and 60 more have been released. Zappa was a iconoclast. Nothing was sacred. 

His music was unyielding. He took control of his time and output. He'd released what he liked and if you liked it too, great. The variety of genres that Zappa covered was impressive. Doo-wop, psychedelic, rock, jazz, fusion, classical, R&B, C&W, rap, blues and chamber. 

The musicians are played for Zappa were impressive. George Duke, Aynsley Dunbar, Dr. John, Terry Bozzio, Dale Bozzio, Vinnie Colaiuta, Eddie Harris, Jeff Beck, Tina Turner and the Ikettes, Chester Thompson and more.

t67erk,hzbd39k,t3_t67erk,"Having similar problems, there's no real way to fix this. The key here is 'basically'.

Example: a song can be roughly 120 bpm, but there's no guarantee that it's spot on 120, so if you 

a) don't start the song exactly at the beat, it will go off after a while  
b) if it's not exactly 120 it will go off no matter what  
c) if it's not electronic music with quantized beats, the tempo will not be consistent troughout the song (which I consider likely since this is Radiohead)

There's a good chance a song got recorded at exactly 120, but during producing they decide to change the tempo a bit. So now it's like 119.65223, good luck finding that out by yourself.

No Hoard of Value has been simply recorded too early for that. Lyrics seem to be more like another take on ""you load 16 tons"". 

It could still be political for the time, as it was the time when political pendulum swung back and pro-Russian government has been elected, having highest support in the eastern regions. And they robbed the country blind, to the level never seen before. Then they needed more money, which Russia was ready to provide for political trade-offs, which went against the election promises, which kicked off the protests at the end of 2013.

But if the band had this idea behind the song, then I don't think they would brush off the question about war in the 2019 interview that I've mentioned. Perhaps they were not comfortable talking about it or something.

Home Back does seem to reflect on the topic somewhat, but it still seems apolitical to me. It is more about war denying home as a symbol of safety and memories, and having an urge to return. The last paragraph pretty much, this isn't Shakespeare really.

So can't really tell if they did allow themselves time to reflect on how exactly their home has been taken from them.

The lead vocalist, Manueal Gag neux, has a pretty soulful voice that alternates with heavier parts with ease. They have some electronic elements, but it is used sparingly and not to the point where it is really ever a focal point of a song. 

Devin Townsend his solo work and Devin Townsend Project are both great. He is a super creative and versatile musician, that doesn't take himself too seriously like some prog guys can. He has an album about an alien searching the universe for a perfect cup of coffee, which sounds amazing.


Opeth *Hertiage* onward is pretty mellow from a vocal standpoint, it strays away from their death metal roots, while keeping the great arrangements.


Mastodon, I'd recommend Crack the Skye and after. Their drummer, Brann Dailor, started singing on that album. Which is dedicated to his sister, so you can really feel the emotion in his voice.

As others have mentioned, Baroness and Mastodon are great examples of just good standard heavy metal, in my opinion. 

Also check out ""Language I: Intuition"" by The Contortionist for an intro into some contemporary experimental/prog metal.

Pelican's 'Australasia', instrumental. Hypnotically sludgey. Still heavy, just slow in general. But some gorgeous riffs.

I was always put off by my experience with Pandora, and even presuming a better functioning recommender algorithm there’s something about personalized music that I dislike.   If I want to listen to  things for just myself, I have an impossibly finely curated library on iTunes that’s full of my friends’ bands, weird little touring groups I caught at mountain top coffee houses, etc.   

When I want to listen to something beyond that, I want to hear what *other* people value, not necessarily which popular songs would be closest to my personal library.  And I’m worried I’d be driven mad trying to persuade the algorithm to show me a broad spectrum of popular music (or even tour into a few interesting sub genres), while it’s actively trying to pin me down to a few favorites.  I know just enough ML to get sucked into trying to game the thing, and pretty soon I’d be thinking about strategic input rather than, er, music.

t51rk9,hz3l6p9,t1_hz3h9sn,"I think navigating playlists on Spotify are pretty easy in my opinion. I’d say just play around with the UI a little bit. On the search option, you can opt for pre-built playlists for specific genres, and from there you can navigate sub-genres. (eg: if you click jazz you have options for smooth jazz, jazz classics, new jazz)

Of course, much like anything these days, it will curate playlists for you, that you certainly don’t have to listen to. These are usually in playlists called Daily Mix’s and will usually (not always) be genre specific for each daily mix.

If you search for specific key words or genres you’d like to hear you can narrow it down to just playlists that other users have made so it feels more human when it comes to playlist curation.

I’ll say this though, Spotify has recommended me some fantastic stuff I’d have never listened to otherwise.",3,0,0,False,False,False,1646255164.0

*Abbey Road* has Come Together, Oh! Darling, Something, Here Comes the Sun, and that absolutely terrific medley on side 2, my favorites being “The End” and “Golden Slumbers”

*Sgt. Peppers* has With a Little Help From My Friends, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Good Morning Good Morning (I didn’t care that much for it until the recent remaster version came out and then I was simply blown away by it), and what may be The Beatles’ all time best overall song, A Day In The Life.

t5ze8v,hz981pn,t3_t5ze8v,"Good voice. Great production. Cool video, pretty strange too with all the huge robot giants littering the landscape.

I like it, especially the  breakdown right at the end. Personally I want more of that stuff at the end, it kinda stuck out for me along with your vocal. You can really belt it out which adds an interesting and different element in to the song too.

t5u3td,hzbb4sr,t1_hz7mff5,"Thanks for the recommendation, but in checking it's not as extensive as I'd like it to be.

For example, on the week of November 19th, it doesn't have the album This Is Your Sign Pt. 1 by Citizen Soldier listed. They're a post-grunge band, and that's an example of a release I would be looking for.

From their subreddit, it's understandable they'd be more focused on their particular scene.

I may end up having to combine resources then to match what I lost in FunkyReleases; it looks like nobody covers much more than their particular scene, which is a shame.",1,0,0,False,False,True,1646400521.0

I've been all over the internet and checked everywhere and cannot find anything that comes remotely close to what this site provided. I don't know if I'm just not looking hard enough or what.

Below is an example of what the site looked like. I'm looking for something similar.
