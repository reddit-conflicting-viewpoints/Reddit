It would probably ease a lot of anxiety I have in day to day life.

I would rather have an “altered carbon” type thing where my consciousness is uploaded into a new body that I have control of. I was always under the impression you still have free will etc when uploaded to the digital world. Now, if someone were truly in control and we were similar to sentient gameplay characters, it would be slightly different.

You’re in the hands of whoever’s running the program - and what if they decide to send you to Hell…?

It may well be that this question will face some of us, in years to come: sure, we’re a long way off right now, in terms of our understanding of the nature of consciousness, let alone our ability to manipulate and reproduce it.

2) I guarantee that 99.9% of people that wait until marriage don’t actually want to, they are just waiting because a religious overlord told them to. The desire for sex causes them to rush into marriage before they’re ready to grow up. Now they’ve committed to an entire life before they’ve even developed critical thinking skills.   

3) in my opinion, having a few years to experiment and find yourself is a huge component to living a satisfying life. A satisfying life is full of memorable experiences.

One of the takeaways from the Amadou Diallo shooting (you know, the original ""shoot a black man for being black"" trial) was that the cops missed most of the times they pulled the trigger. It is hard to shoot well when you are under stress, and the honest to god truth is most cops aren't 'gun people' who will train with their weapons constantly. They rarely even break leather on a regular basis.

So, before all of this came to the forefront, there was an awful lot of hushed conversation about the general militarization of police, a surprising amount of it from conservative circles. The case in question revolves around a white police officer who shot a white suspect who was following the officer's orders, but the officer gave contradicting orders and then shot the suspect dead. Turns out, this cop had 'kill' etched into his rifle and was generally someone that ought not be allowed to carry a weapon.

Since it has spread to overseas citizens and military members. We are now being attacked world wide. Those employees of USA were forced to sign NDAs or fired and losing healthcare, retirement, disability and benefits. The Government has tried to bury the story.  while we are still being attacked.

IF, the release of Covid was on purpose, These attacks may be by the same country. Two countries knew within weeks that covid could be spread by pets and took measures to limit the spread by animals. One country had developed and was selling vaccines worldwide long before other countries. Two countries were far ahead of the USA and the rest of the world in the understanding of the covid virus. Remember there were zero vaccines on the market for any COVID VACINNES for humans before COVID-19. If you are going to release such a weapon, you would not release it outside your own virus lab, but you would release it of an opponents lab to cause strife between your two biggest foes. Worst yet, it could be two separate attacks by two foes.

It all has a fairly wild west feel to it.

That's how I was introduced to the realm of psychedelic phenethylamines like the 2C's. For me 2C-E was probably *the* white whale. It could be harder to find because it wasn't as popular as 2C-I or 2C-B, but it was worth the hunt for me because I always found the introspective nature of 2C-E much more fascinating and even therapeutic to a certain extent.

snzqqv,"Back when I was bouncing in college, a woman came into the bar who was very much the stereotype of ""I'm hot and I know it and I'm used to getting my way because of it"".

She kept coming by and trying to ask me for little favors, I think just to prove that she could. I just put up with it at first, didn't do anything for her but let her so her weird thing.

We had a little pop up pizza stand outside of the bar that would sell to people at the bars. I had one of the other bouncers watch the door while I stepped out, got some pizza, and came back in. Before hand, this woman had come back up and was telling me ""Oh you should get me some pizza when you go, come on get me a slice"". To which I told her, yeah fuck no, why would I do that?

Well I come back in with my pizza, take my spot back at the front door and start eating. She comes back up and starts asking for, and then demanding, some of my pizza. I kept telling her no, and to fuck off, and eventually said if she didn't leave me alone she was out. She then proceeded to complain to the head bartender, going on this long winded rant to him about how I was being such an asshole to her, she was just trying to be friendly and I was being such a dick.

After she finished he just turned to me, and asked me what was going on. I explained what she'd been doing, and he turns back to her and says ""Well if he says you're out, you're out. That's the bouncers decision"".

She got _super_ pissed at that point, bitching me out and cursing at me. I told her it was time to go and walked her out of the bar, during which she took a picture of me (and my gf at the time, who was standing by me and keeping me company while I was on shift). I just flipped her off and told her to fuck off.

The next day I come into work and my coworkers all show me a Yelp review she wrote about me and the bar. At first I was worried they'd be pissed about the negative review, but they couldn't care less. We all had a good laugh over her ridiculous rant of a review, several paragraphs long of this fabricated tale of how she was just nice and friendly and I was such a huge asshole to her the entire time before kicking her out with no good reason. She even included the picture she took of me and my gf on the way out, as a cherry on top.

If you started your period on the 1st of the month, had sex on the 10th, and ovulated on the 14th, by the time your next period was due (on the 28th) you’d be classed as 4 weeks pregnant; even though you only conceived 2 weeks prior.

Edit: let’s also take into account how most periods aren’t as wonderfully reliable as 28 days. The luteal phase (after ovulation and before period) is almost always the same each month (though different for each person). However, so many factors can contribute to the length of the follicular phase before ovulation (for example, stress), which is why some people frequently have irregular periods.

snzpok,"January 1st to the end of September is 9 months. That’s also 273 days, or 39 weeks.

Check out https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=01&d1=01&y1=2022&m2=09&d2=30&y2=2022&ti=on if you want to confirm.

March 1st to the end of November is two days longer, since February isn’t included. That’s 39 weeks and two days.

The starting point for the “40 weeks” figure is the first day of the last menstrual period. But conception occurs during ovulation. “In an average 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period.” ( [Source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/ovulation-signs/faq-20058000) ) Note that most women ovulate anywhere between day 11 and 21 of their cycle, so there’s a bit of range. That said, 14 days is still on the lower end. This means that a pregnancy term, as measured from conception, would actually be closer to 38 weeks - and that’s *less* than 9 months.

In terms of “why do we say 9 months?” Because to anyone who isn’t involved in the medical process, months are easier to work with. Months are what we’re used to. Very few people track how far we are into the year with weeks, but almost everyone could tell you that it’s February and that February is the second month of the year. It’s the same way a childfree couple will roll their eyes when you say “Little Timmy is 28 months old today” and ask why you didn’t just say he was 2. Because to them talking about someone’s age in months is preposterous. But as his parents or a childcare provider or his doctor, you’ll know that based on developmental milestones the difference between 25 and 34 months is huge.

The inverse of this is the same reason why [doctors want us to use weeks](https://slate.com/technology/2016/08/pregnancy-doesnt-last-nine-months-it-lasts-40-weeks.html). But it’s not because it’s closer to 10 months; it’s because weeks are less ambiguous, more specific, and more useful with regard to milestones.",hw5uw2r,t3_snzpok,1644368943.0,False

I have a theory that I said in the Hazbin/Helluva chat channel, but I want to elaborate on.
There's another theory that dead sinner demons can't actually die and that when they do their essence moves to inanimate objects hence why there are so many objects with seemingly alive eyes. I think that a demon with a lot of technical knowledge, or maybe Sir Pent himself created some sort of machine that would harness the essence as it dispersed (Like the moment the demon ""dies"") and puts it into the eggs. Perhaps Sir Pent can lay eggs like some snakes and uses his own unfertilized eggs in the process? That part is a bit out there, but the machine I think is totally possible.

I often ding myself for not reading enough, but when I think about it, I read all the time. I tend to stick to political stuff.

You know, way back when, people were forced to literally copy books when they were learning how to write. James Joyce did this and confessed to copying entire novels by hand.

The things she chose to blow the credit union's money on were ridiculous for the clientele we'd always served.

 So we casually talk and he mentions that our parents were friends at one point, I didn't know this but found it interesting. I meet his mom and she ask about my dad and they get in contact again (weird). So eventually he brings up some small town drama that involved my mom, I get defensive and we didn't talk anymore even though I really wanted to smash and was really close. 

 So I go to my mom who is almost done with probation and about to regain custody and she gives the full story of the drama, tea and all. My mom and dad were swingers (I knew this) but around the time I was conceived a couple conceived too.

>The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII,\[further explanation needed\] to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retroactively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history\[1\] to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.\[2\] According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a ""phantom time"" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages.",hw5n5uy,t1_hw5mseo,1644365662.0,False

snz1i0,"It is not, in fact plausible. Again quoting from the wiki, which just gives a skimming overview and not a detailed refutation  


>The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in ancient astronomy, especially those of solar eclipses cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to question the hypothesis. One is reported by Pliny the Elder in 59 AD\[9\] and one by Photius in 418 AD.\[10\] Both of these dates and times have confirmed eclipses. In addition, observations during the Tang dynasty in China, and Halley's Comet, for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no ""phantom time"" added.\[11\]\[12\]  
Archaeological remains and dating methods such as dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) refute, rather than support, ""phantom time"".\[13\]  
The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325 AD, the time of the Council of Nicaea, which had established a method for determining the date of Easter Sunday by fixing the vernal equinox on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's ""three missing centuries"" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.\[14\]  
If Charlemagne and the Carolingian dynasty were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including Anglo-Saxon England, the Papacy, and the Byzantine Empire. The ""phantom time"" period also encompasses the life of Muhammad and the Islamic expansion into the areas of the former Western Roman Empire, including the conquest of Visigothic Iberia. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the Tang dynasty of China and its contact with the Islamic world, such as at the Battle of Talas.",hw5nwt8,t1_hw5ngjm,1644365979.0,False
