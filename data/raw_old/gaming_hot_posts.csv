They got the actors behind Pablo, Kelly, Shelly, Scott, to lend their voices to their movie and show roles 


There will be no story mode for the game, Tim Wilitis who worked with ID for many years on the Quake Franchise, Doom, Rage and now runs Saber interactive has stated in an interview that there will be a few single player missions, and offline multiplayer being playable with A.I. bots but the main focus of the game is asymmetrical multiplayer with PVP/PVE gameplay. 


The S-Mart, Army Of Darkness Medievel Armor Ash, and Evil Dead 1 Ash skins are locked behind preorder dlc and not unlockable in the main game. 


The ""Collectors edition"" which comes with a replica Necromicon Ex Mortis, Vinyl Soundtrack, hardcover art book, dlc codes for a Savini designed ash skin, army of darkness knight outfit, Evil dead 1 ash skin, s-Mart uniform skin, has already been sold out due to scalpers getting their hands on the preorders too. 


It's a PVP/PVE focused experience where 4 players will work together to stop the Deadites from causing chaos in the multiplayer maps available, with each character a different class, while one player gets to play as a Kandarian demon using the environment, deadites, and eventually be able to possess players. 


The car is somewhat useable in cutscenes and traveling to certain areas of the map when needed. 


It will be on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X, PS5 and Nintendo switch. 


I can expect people to be trolls as any asymmetrical multiplayer experience by spawn killing, team killing, cheating with hacked bots, ruining the game for all of the people that play it. 


Bruce says this is the definitive evil dead experience in the interview with Geoff Keighly, and Tim Wilitis but I don't think it is to be honest. I don't think a lot of the Evil Dead fanbase was asking for a multiplayer PvP and PVE style experience from the franchise.",1644412898.0

Everything I have I've either beaten, quit due to toxicity (cough R6 cough) or the ending got spoiled (what are the fucking chances someone is still posting the ending to Fallout 4 and Dying Light in 2022). I just don't have anything to play rn, and it makes me sad cause I do really fucking enjoy video games, but I have no drive to play them rn. 

 My favorite games so far are both Portals, Detroit Become Human, and Titanfall 2 (the campaign, as soon as I bought the game the servers went down, so I got like 2 or 3 online matches in before it broke. fun as hell while it lasted). 

My main and pretty much only issue with all 3 of those games is how little time they took. I beat both portals in 2 days, beat the Titanfall 2 campaign in like 5 hours, and finished Detroit in 2. I've played all 3 of these in the past year, and each one actually made me excited to get home from school and hop on the same way they did as a kid. Just trying to find that again.

So I'm looking for story games that will last me longer than a day. I know I mentioned Dying Light and Fallout 4, and again fucking TikTok spoiled both game's endings, so I'm not really as into playing them anymore. Probably still gonna finish Fallout tho since it's fucking great so far. But I want a game that I can feel attached to the characters, something where I'm genuinely into it. I don't really care about graphics or age, recommend as far back as you like cause I probably haven't played it (strict parents are fun). Idk if this is too much to ask or not, but any and all help is welcome. Also, any game in general too I guess, doesn't have to be a story game, I've just had the best experience with story games so far. Thanks!",1644420416.0

No real objective at all, do what you want and no need to have a map with 800 side missions that have no meaning at all. SotC is a bit more linear but it doesn't feel that way due to the vast open world map it has. 

Lately there has been a tendency with open-world games where there's a minimap and 200 side quests that you don't need to do but are ""forced"" on the screen. Far Cry 3 was the first game in this category that I played and I enjoyed it, but I also think it's the last one of its kind I've finished. I tried playing The Witcher 3 and I ended up quitting because the amount of things that were happening on the map gave me anxiety and the experience ended up being frustrating instead of enjoyable.

The games in the Dragon Quest series (well, VIII and XI, the ones I've played) also do this very well IMO. There are side quests but they are much less in quantity and really feel ""optional"". They aren't forced to the player.

On to the post.

Everyone's favorite video to complain about in Halo Infinite:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof\_desync\_is\_the\_games\_fault\_less\_than\_10\_ping/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof_desync_is_the_games_fault_less_than_10_ping/)

Do you guys realize how many of those shots missed? It's not as obvious that it's a desync issue as it seems. Some shots hit the shoulder, some go over the shoulder, one of those bursts to the head at the end miss to the left. Intuitively, it looks despicably bad, but it's not as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

I think it may be a negative halo effect (no pun intended) of hearing about it, then when people who aren't as familiar with the gameplay mechanics play the game, it's automatically blamed on desync. Some of the videos I've seen clearly have nothing to do with desync, which I can only assume is blamed on that for the lack of understanding of how the game works, plus the primer of assuming desync is such an issue. For example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo\_infinites\_desync\_issue\_in\_a\_nutshell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo_infinites_desync_issue_in_a_nutshell/)

Or this one, which is lag, not desync:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my\_worst\_desync\_so\_far/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my_worst_desync_so_far/)

I've personally never noticed anything out of the ordinary in Halo Infinite. In every game from COD to Halo, you sometimes wonder how tf you didn't get that kill. There's a lot of adrenaline and sometimes you just feel like it should've been a kill, but 95/100 times it's explainable outside of desync.

And that's all I've got to say about that. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

In honor of those that aren't just jumping to conclusions, here are some videos I found that *are* actually desync:

I mean like features that let you immerse better into the world and simply take in the ambiance. Where your character can just build a zone to relax, sit down, sleep, eat, drink and just taking the time in that world before heading out to more adventures and fights. Most games are rushing from one point to the next or the one that do offer similar features are simply lowered down like they let your character rest but you are stuck in some sort of menu to do other things like watching over your character's skill and so on which is of course nice but once you done it you done it and then you wanna leave that menu but can't chill around. This is why I appreciate walking feature so much in games where the character is usually on the run to remind you to relax from time to time.

I saw my homie scroll through some titles on his Series X with gamepass like it was Netflix, and he always has titles he's playing and loves the value he gets from it. I'm enamored by the idea and generally play lots of different games, so I'm considering picking up the S for the value w/ gamepass.

I dunno, it's just something about the idea of mankind messing around with their own biology that appeals to me. Those that I know of that go deep into this are Space Marines from Warhammer 40k and Spartans from Halo. Technically, the details of those are in the books, but since they're also in videogame format and there are a lot of super soldiers that I'm not aware of in videogames, I thought this might be an appropriate place to ask.

There are some details on Cyberware from the Shadowrun franchise, but they don't go in-depth with that. The Starcraft books talk about the difference between Ghosts and Spectres, but those are mostly differences in training and the latter having exposure to Terrazine. No details on whether or not these individuals have undergone any body mods. And I don't know if there are any comics out there that talk about what exactly the Super Soldier Serum in Marvel does outside of ""This sauce makes you awesome"".

XCOM EW has the Gene and Mech Troopers, but they don't go deep enough to tickle my fancy. The Mass Effect games have lore pertaining to biotics and implants, but iirc it's only really limited to biotics.

The game feels different because you didn't need to do anything at all. There was no objectives (besides the main story line) and side quests really felt like side quests. What games do this in the same way as BOTW?

It looks good, it feels good, and the overall quality of the game is pretty high. Sure, you can see where some of the element's kind of remind you of a gacha style game, but it's not pushing anything on you, and I've certainly not run into anything that would make me feel like I need to purchase anything beyond the base game that I've already paid for. Though I have to say, the game does sort of make you feel like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, especially considering the limited success, and circumstances of New World. Its like, ""okay, this is a good game and all and I'm having fun, but where's the big nasty reveal,"" but so far, that hasn't happened. My only concerns thus far are these:

Currently, all of the content I've cleared has been fairly easy, and nothing has been particularly challenging, even solo dungeoning stuff. So I am worried/interested to see how they handle that in more of the end game content.

Second, there are a lot of currencies in this game, between rapport and silver and gold and everything else, so that becoming a heavy focus for cash grab, and being a potential avenue for abuse is a concern. But obviously that's a ""take it as it comes"" kind of situation.

Overall though...its not bad. The style of game is not for everyone, and the combat system is not as...sticky? as maybe I'd like it to be. It's pretty easy to lose target focus on enemies when there's lots of trash mobs, so that can be a bit frustrating. And obviously having a lot of your abilities being directionally controlled by cursor takes some getting used to. But honestly, those are minor complaints.

All in all, time will tell if this game will live up to expectations in the long run. But as of right now, it seems to be what was promised. Which, I have to say, given the way games have been being released for the last several years now, is fucking refreshing.",1644389615.0

Its nice to see games from the past are still here. Like mortal kombat, gran turismo, gta (yeah, you should see the first gta😂)
Sonic, tekken, and fifa I'm playing since fifa 94.
And every generation I say it can't get better like this. But all the next gen consoles keep amazing me. Like the matrix demo is just insane. And now all the digital games. When I was younger I needed to take a ride of 1hour just to buy a physical game.

Yeah, I'm getting old 😅😅",1644328683.0

I’m playing GTAO for years now and I’m recently moved to another country due work. 

My problem now with GTAO is that every session I join now has these very annoying Chinese chat spammers and modders. I think it’s due to network localization because of where I live now. (Istanbul). 

I moved from Europe to Turkey for work and also am going to live there for a while. It’s nice and great but the servers of GTAO is just so awful now.

I can’t connect with my friends because for some reason the connection drops (VPN). And if I don’t use VPN and my friends join me, the Chinese spammers and modders appears and ruins our gameplay. 

So I often join them instead they join me but the problem is that they sometimes the annoying people still join our session. 

So now I do not know if I can name the VPN application here but I use one paid VPN for several reasons and I tried to play GTAO with it but the connection is so poor. 

I kindly want to know if some other GTAO players also uses VPN and how their experiences are. 

I also would love to know which VPN is the best for gaming. Or just for GTAO.

Not the forest, sons of the forest or the long dark... Those are already on my nerd radar.

Another I need is something mindless but relaxing, like any sort of base builder or nature thing, I just need something with a decent serotonin boost especially after playing sekiro haha. Examples I guess would be slime rancher, spiritfarer, Minecraft... Bit more mindless and relaxing haha.

Don't worry about the price, I can handle that. Any and all game suggestions are more than welcome, indie or professional, I really don't mind either. Thank you all so much for any help you can offer",1644360766.0

snw4a7,Are power trips healthy?,0,0.38,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/snw4a7/are_power_trips_healthy/,8,"!Wall of text warning!

I've never heard of this problem and genuinely don't know who to talk to about it.

I come from a very competitive fighting scene, me and my friends started in dragonball xenoverse, before moving to games like fighter Z, blazblue, guilty gear, tekken etc.

We were very present in the dragonball scene. We were normal weebs just having fun until they released the esl online ""tournaments"". Then everything changed.

We turned our lives into ""Work, Eat, Train, Repeat"" for a very long time. It became more than a game to us. We probably took it more seriously than we should have. 

We spent a very long time fighting eachother and naturally wanted to expand our skillsets, seeking random players to fight, often calling on multiple players to fight us individually.

Winning these 1v2/1v3 fights is the singlehanded, most intense power trip i have ever experienced. The only time i've come close to this feeling is in dark souls, successfully defending against multiple invaders simultaneously. 

Most of us have moved on to more casual things. I didn't. Every game i play seems to revolve around this desire to feel unimaginable power. And i find myself bored if i can't satisfy the feeling in me. 

I constantly feel like i have to practice to be better than my friends, it feels almost toxic when they want to have a good time and i simply can't help but obliterate them. I can't laugh, i can't say anything or give them advice because it feels so toxic, to the point where i don't want to play with my friends in fear of going overboard or ruining what could have been a good time.

I hate it because i genuinely enjoy casual games and playing with my friends, but simply can't play them anymore for this reason. Its almost addictive. I loved heavy rain, indigo prophecy and the life is strange games. But for the life of me i could not play detroit become human, despite loving the story, characters and world to death. 

Is this just a me thing? Should i stop playing games all together? Should i talk to a psychologist?",1644357610.0

It was me who was garbage, three other teammates who were also garbage, and Ark vs. the sweatiest team of SnD players I've ever seen. Every round went almost exactly the same. We would rush a site while Ark lurked with a .50, get almost immediately domed by three enemies with awps, and maybe chunk one or two. Then Ark was in a 1v4-5, where he started popping heads. In vr. With a gun that has no sights. Every round he had about 3 of us buying him the .50 so he could get body armor or whatever it was. The other team would get progressively more irritated at Ark's godhood to the point 3 of them would typically break off to intercept his usual route. Despite all that hard carrying and how hard the other team was stomping us and our general incompetence, nobody was being a huge asshole on the mic or constantly calling us garbage and everybody had a great time.

Likewise we all know about Super Mario RPG despite it not being released on any console in over a decade don't we?

I used to play some hardcore multiplayer and enjoy it, but most of those games are pretty much dead, especially when it comes to hardcore mode (I know people play BF4 still, but it's multi and it's non-hardcore).

Are there any **SINGLE-PLAYER** games where I could enjoy a fair bit of realism and follow the story? **I'm talking about historical/modern setting, I don't like horror games like STALKER or METRO.**

All I could find is PUBG and some modern shooters, but I'm pretty picky about the multiplayer thing and I'd rather replay some CoD: Black Ops campaing. I also tried TARKOV, but this is absolutely not my style (save for firefights) - I play like 2-3 hours max per week and anything that requires more than 20 minutes is absolute no-no to me.

smz4fv,EA Support hung up on me today... twice,62,0.71,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/smz4fv/ea_support_hung_up_on_me_today_twice/,88,"I got on EA support chat to request a refund of Battlefield 2042 today. 

I said i believe I'm entitled to a refund under the Consumer Protection Act of Ontario section 14(2)3.

It says that you are entitled to a refund if the product was misrepresented. Specifically that the goods or services are represented as being of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model but they are actually not. 

I told them that Battlefield 2042 satisfies that in two ways. It was sold as a fully functional game, where it is actually a broken buggy mess. As evidenced by the developer publicly apologizing for their failure to meet expectations. 

It was also sold as a live service, those features have just been delayed by at least six months. I also added that the live service features have already been delayed 4 months so if they manage to stick to that timeline it's still almost a year late. 

Product is not as described. This is not the AAA experience i paid for. I did not buy this as an early access title. 

The first CSA i dealt with told me it does not meet EA's eligibility for refund, and ignored the law stuff i asked about. I told her it is under Canadian law. She repeated it was not eligible and hung up on me.

Keep in mind I've played this game about three times. Probably still under ten hours. 

Not to be deterred, i started another chat with a new CSA and made the same points. He kept insisting there were ""no options available"", refused to escalate me to a supervisor, and also hung up on me. 

EA, your game is broken. Give me my god damned money.

snpojw,What are your favorite boss arenas in the Soulsblood series?,1,0.6,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/snpojw/what_are_your_favorite_boss_arenas_in_the/,2,"1. Maneater from Demon's Souls - The fight is definitely flawed but the narrow arena makes the boss interesting more than anything else. 

2. Gravelord Nito from Dark Souls - I love the pacing this encourages with the center piece causing a divide between small and large skeletons. Any unaware players can mistakenly trigger the large skeletons for a more intense battle but a knowledgeable player can properly keep distance. However the entrance is a bit cheap especially if you don't use spells for the drop damage. 

3. Dragonrider from Dark Souls 2 - The boss may be very exploitable but it's an arena that rewards exploration that benefits the player with more platforming. I love the idea but it needs to be more punishing in my opinion. 

4. Micolash, Host of the Nightmare from Bloodborne - I've learned to appreciate this boss more over the years and it's arena definitely stands out. It works like a fun house and oddly has variety for a puzzle fight which the arena design greatly accommodates. 

5. Ancient Wyvern from Dark Souls 3 - Not a great boss but definitely a well designed obstacle course. I even had players compete to see who could go through it the fastest and it was an absolute blast. 

6. True Corrupted Monk from Sekiro - Sekiro doesn't have many unique arenas in terms of hostile design but I found that this boss arena had the most going for it with optional stealth by hiding in the trees and the narrow bridge forcing the player to get close to the boss.",1644341320.0
