snmu28,that first sip (of fascist starbucks propaganda) feeling… 🥶,1,1.0,antiwork,https://i.redd.it/3eq9neybnmg81.jpg,0,,1644333986.0
snmsiy,I'm done. I can't do this anymore.,1,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snmsiy/im_done_i_cant_do_this_anymore/,0,"Story time chillldrenn! Sorry for the lengthy post. But I needed to vent. 

Over the last 2 maybe 3 years I've been working weekly with a counselor on my mental health. In that time I've had some significant breakthroughs, I think. My history, I've been in food service management for the last 10-12 years. In the beginning it was hard. In the middle it was hard. In the end it was terribly hard. 

In the beginning, I was still learning how to manage people. This is where companies should spend more time and resources. Helping people understand how to manage people. Companies and corporations teach managers how to manage commodities not people. They teach us that people are only a means to make money and they're all replaceable. This was my mantra as well because I didn't know any differently. Then I started organically shifting my focus to caring for them as people. Hiring more and more people so that everyone could have the schedule they wanted instead of what the business wanted. 

The middle: After making this breakthrough of treating people like people,  my business started flourishing. We were doing the unthinkable. Taking a 30k a week business to 60k a week over 4 years. Huge impact to company and it started getting me looks for promotions. Eventually, I applied for one of the new opportunities only to be completely disregarded and didn't even receive a phone call or a text explaining why I wasn't ""the one."" This lead me to again realize that I'm the only person (from my perspective) trying to treat people like people. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I started looking for new jobs with different companies- so  I could make a real difference. 

The middle continued: 

I found an ad for a small restaurant looking for a general manager. It was a small pay increase, a slightly longer commute, but amazing hours. Home by 5pm most nights (which is unheard of in food service. I start the position training directly under the owner. Red flags start immediately on my first day. The owner was late, so I start busying myself by checking dates in the reach in cooler. Pop and juice type items. I find that more than half have are significantly past their best by date. I move the expired products to a table and wait for the owner, so I can figure out the waste protocols. The owner gets there and says, ""Why is all this not in the cooler?"" I explain, ""They're past date."" Owner replies, ""They're fine, it's only a suggested date."" I put them all back in the cooler,  I don't want to make too big of waves day 1.

2.5 months go by- the owner is condescending and talks down to everyone including me. The environment is incredibly toxic and the owner decides to open a catering side business that falls under my direction (good bye, good hours of operation). I start having to manage the restaurant during the day and work these events at night. Leading to 50+ hours a week. With at least one 14 hour day a week for the catering. I decide this isn't worth it and put my 2 week notice in. Two days later I get a message saying they need me to come in on my day off for an exit interview, because they need to know why it's not working. We can't do it on a day I work because it's an ""emergency"" they need to fix what's broken for whoever comes next. 

Now I've had some exit interviews, they usually last less than 30 minutes. So fine. I go in to have the exit interview. I explain the toxicity how no one likes being talked down at.  Then 2 HOURS into this exit interview the owner stands up very aggressively and points their finger at me making a point (talking down to me like a child) about a counter point I made. I was ready for this- it's my damn day off- not today Satan. I had my key for the store separated from my key ring and my uniforms ready in a bag. I set the key down on the table and looked at the other 3 people in the interview and said,  ""This. This is why I'm leaving,  only now it's today instead of a week and a half from now.""

I took the summer off and worked further on myself. Spent much needed time with my family and really had the summer of my life! 

The beginning of the end: 

All good things must end. So to did the summer of my life. I started looking for jobs close to home. Found one nearly immediately that sounded great! Multi-unit management (like a district manager) for a restaurant franchise company. I'd get a car, expense account, and most of the stores are within 30 minutes of home. Great opportunity- on paper. I interview for the position and essentially fall in love with the idea of the job and not the words the interviewer was using (I know- my bad). Ultimately, the interviewer said, ""I want to bring you on, but I don't think you're quite ready for the role your applying for and I let this person talk me into managing the site closest to my house for 6ish months then get the role I applied for. Like I said, I was blinded by this person's salesmanship and I took what they offered. 

Started the new job. The training (if we can call it that) consisted of a ""hybrid"" of online video courses and in person training. Red flag #2 the people in the store say this is how you do (this), then the videos tell you an ultimately completely different way of doing (this). 

My trainer was apparently in the same holding pattern waiting on promotion and as soon as I was ""ready"" the trainer's position opened for them. So to say my training was brief is an understatement. 

For those of you playing the home game, I've now been promised a promotion within 6 months and I've built my knowledge on a sandy foundation. Next I focus on the team. I begin trying to change the culture to where the team feels appreciated, the same way from ""the beginning"" section, hiring, staffing the store with their preferred availability, etc. Basically treating them like people not commodities that I own and can shuffle at random. The team immediately begins mostly shaping up and trying ( now this team received only one half of the training I did,  no online courses for them) their best. But you can only do so well with an incomplete knowledge of what you want to do. In addition,  my trainer was coming in on my days off and undermining everything I was trying to change. Talking badly about people (and myself) when they weren't there to defend themselves,  causing and creating even more toxicity in the store.

Through all this I was trying to keep my eyes on the 6 month prize. I made it to 4 months. One day the evening manager couldn't make it in to close the store. And the upper level manager (the person that interviewed me) said that I would need to stay to close the store in their absence. This means that I was going to work from 5am-11pm. No Bueno. I text the manager letting them know that they should be expecting my formal 2 week notice immediately. The manager called immediately and tried to talk me out of it, ""let me fix this, I was completely unaware of the situation. We'll get you in the car sooner than we talked about. Etc."" It almost worked until they said,  ""take the rest of the day to think about it, then we'll talk tomorrow."" Without missing a beat,  I replied,  ""yeah, I'll have plenty time to think for the rest of this LONG shift."" The next day I sent in my notice. 

Now,  I'm finished working there, but the team, that I actually care about,  is working thrive the aftermath. I was unable to completely staff 2 days of the week with what they're used to having. 3 people instead of 4. I communicated this with my manager (two weeks before it happened) as it is their responsibility to now assist this team. They didn't show up for the first of the two shifts to assist and the supervisor on duty got the cold shoulder from their now manager. This person walked out on the store after not getting or feeling any support. I think I accidentally started an avalanche of quitting. 

All I did was treat them the way I want to be treated. I let them know their worth and I didn't hold anything back. Another part of the way I manage, transparency. People deserve to know the info if it effects them! 

So if you're meeting score- I now have false promises of promotion (reason for leaving first job, and toxicity in the workplace reason for quitting second job ALL under one roof. I'm so lucky).

Now:
The real reason for my post. I don't feel like I fit at any position anymore. I'm so sick and tired of the way the workforce is treated. Corporations don't care about people only money, bad news, small business is the same way. I don't really know what to do to support my family, but there has to be some way that I can earn a living and not feel sick at the same time for the way either I have to treat people or for the way they are treated by the ownership.

 If you've read this far, I appreciate you. I hope my story speaks to you. You are worth it. Your mental health is with me than the pennies you make compared to the dollars they make. No one (most people won't)  will stand for you personally. We have to change the world, we are not COMMODITIES to be used until a better ""fit"" for the position comes along. Be the change you want to see, demand fairness of treatment, proper breaks, and pay. Fight the good fight!",1644333867.0

I (34F) have various non-visible disabilities. I have a compromised immune system (which has caused me to catch covid 3 times despite being triple-vaxxed and very careful with masks and social distancing... my savings got consumed by the ICU), fibromyalgia, severe rare gastric problems that cause me to be chronically underweight no matter what treatment I do or what doctor I see (no kidding, the Discovery Health Channel scouted me for a ""Mystery Diagnosis"" episode years ago,  as my case is so rare and I'm one of few survivors), as well as depression/anxiety as a result of various childhood and relationship abuses prior to meeting my wonderul husband. 

Aside from actually neeting to USE my sick days days unlike others in this workaholic country of the USA (using PTO seems to be deeply frowned upon by bosses around here, like it's a personal failing), it does not affect my performance and ability to meet deadlines. That's because I've always pushed through the (excruciating) pain and overachieved. But, doing so takes a severe toll on my body/mind that others don't realize or take seriously. 

I'm currently job-hunting after a second layoff in 4 months (covid budget cuts). I can't perform manual jobs for obvious reasons. I am physically weak but motivated and well educated (not trying to brag, but just giving some context since you all don't know me). Basically, I thrive in white-collar desk jobs, as my body can't handle physical ones. Moreover, my husband is a teacher, whose pay is a joke despite how very HARD he works, and we live in an expensive metropolitan area. So, it's always been up to me to bread-win.

 Many applications ask if I have a disability. Their definition of a disability always encompasses what I actually do have. 

I know white-collar employers like to call themselves ""equal opportunity employers""... but is it true? Since my ailments aren't visually apparent (this messed up world likes to compliment me for my underweight appearance, not realizing that it's unhealthy, so people tend not to take my struggles seriously).

Do I check ""yes"" on the disability question? I know hiring managers aren't ""supposed"" to discriminate, but do they still quietly do so in their minds? Will disclosure secretly ruin my chances?

Honest question.

snm5zs,My current scale for my frustration level at work.,6,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snm5zs/my_current_scale_for_my_frustration_level_at_work/,4,"I been frustrated at work lately, but it has really come to a head in the last couple of weeks. To the point, I started applying for new jobs last week. Last night was a six application evening. I now have interviews schedule for everyday this week, and I already have a job offer. The offer is unfortunately for less then I am making now but still, it feels good. 

I also know my current employer will have an incredible difficult time replacing me.  I am an Web Developer, who built their web application that calculates the values for used aircraft. To say it is an niche area, is an understatement.  It requires advance understanding of database structure, math and web applications. 

My particular frustration comes from having rebuilt the interface to manage the database for the aircraft historical data, and asking my boss to test it for the last six months before it went live. It went live a few weeks ago and my boss, the primary user never tested it, or even looked it. But now there are errors, and he inform me he is too busy to test the interface. But expects me to work days where the office is close, to fix the issues, while he is off work. There was even a day when I was coming out of surgery three years ago, and I was called on my way home from the hospital. I had to do work, home fresh from surgery, before I could take my pain meds.

I am the only backend developer they have. I have worked for the company for over five years (no raise ever), with only help from one part time front end developer. They have occasionally try to hire another developer, but no one has been able to handle the math and database needed for the pay they are offering.

snknru,The fallacy of professional fulfillment and the anti-work movement,25,0.97,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snknru/the_fallacy_of_professional_fulfillment_and_the/,4,"(Long text alert)

Before the pandemic, we lived in the age of seeking ""professional fulfillment"", with the media selling the idea of ""​​pursuing a career doing what you love"", because then ""you won't work a day in your life"". So, we went to great lengths to achieve such a realization, even if it meant sacrificing our health and personal life. In fact, this sacrifice was well accepted by the corporate world, for obvious reasons. It was ""cool"" to be a workaholic. If the workaholic was getting sicker and sicker, physically and emotionally, it didn't matter.

In fact, the aversion to work has always existed. Therefore, employers and the system needed to instill ideas of professional fulfillment in people, as well as the fear of being poor and homeless, so that they would remain tame, working more and more, and generating billions in profits for the system, in the promise of a better life and such ""professional fulfillment"".

The pandemic has partially broken this paradigm. While, on one hand, some workers were forced to go to the workplace, to have contact with other people, and thus increase the risks of contracting Covid, others went through the experience of paid isolation, that is, they spent days off at home, because at the time there was hope that the pandemic would last a month at most.

The isolation made people start to reflect on the lifestyle they had been living so far, and how much absurdity there is in it. Many understood that their role was just to be a cog in a machine that generates power and wealth only for its owners. Thus, they began to occupy their time with really meaningful activities, and far from the slave-holding standard of the corporate world.

Many workers, meanwhile, have already moved directly from office work to remote work, with all its pros and cons.

So, while for some there was a chance to have greater flexibility in schedules and better use of time for their personal tasks,

for others it caused enormous stress, as it became more difficult to manage home and work at the same time.

Employers, for their part, had cleverly taken advantage of the fact that most workers were loving remote work to increase their workload and demand more productivity. Since workers were ""happy"" with their new condition and dreaded the idea of ​​having to go back to the office, they would ""gladly accept"" the massive increase in the number of tasks.

The routine of endless working hours, calls and emails outside of office hours and on weekends has become very common. People were no longer able to separate work from rest.

This whole situation quickly multiplied the cases of burnout, anxiety and depression in the corporate world. People were getting sick even at home, even living the dream of remote work, and this also made them question the current employment model.

Workers who were forced to risk their lives in the workplace were revolted. Many actually contracted Covid, many have died and/or infected relatives (who often died as well).

People began to realize what work really is: a modern form of slavery, which will enrich only the employer and the system. Those who do not work are excluded economically and socially. The promises of ""make your way to the top"" or ""work with what you love"" are nothing more than traps to keep the employee tame and obedient"".

I can access my paystub and see the check that was generated, but that was almost 2 weeks ago and my parents have reported they still have not got anything.

I've asked if there's someone else I can talk to about this, but the operator has insisted there's no one else that handles that.

It's possible they sent to my previous address, but can I take this a step further if my employer is being no help? Is it normal to take this long to send a check out?

I work in a very small manufacturing job in a fairly rural area. It’s pretty wack all around, but it required vaccinations which is pretty wild for where I’m at. I get paid 14 an hour and technically am full time. 

I haven’t had a full week of work since Christmas. There have been supply issues, met with ineptitude that have left us with nothing to consistently produce for months. On top of that they turn the heat off in the warehouse after every shift, making it insanely unpleasant every morning. I’m talking 38 degrees inside when we show up. 

The boss sits in his office with his space heater every day leaving me with my co-worker, who begins sneaking drinks at around 9 am and is fairly drunk by lunch. The chaos of that place is too much for me. 

Last week my coworker had a Covid exposure via his sister who he lives with. While testing negative, my employer doesn’t seem to grasp the concept of the incubation period and I’m not trying to willingly expose me self. I live with my partner and my father, both of which have compromised immune systems. 

I decided that a text was all that was needed here. There’s barely enough work as it is, and before I came along it was just a one man show. My boss immediately calls me, and texts me saying that a heads up would have been appreciated. He’s not mad but wants to work something out. I’m supposed to call him to day, though I don’t know what to say. 

It’s so hard to battle internalized guilt, I’ve been conditioned to work hard and not complain. These conditions are less than ideal and it seems so obvious to me. I’m struggling in defending my decision even to my self.",1644327851.0

&#x200B;

Obviously, I want to him to pay tax.

Obviously, I am aware that he's a millionaire.

Obviously, I am aware that he is on his soapbox (though I'd argue it's his job).

Obviously, I also know that he has one hell of a cushy job; a lot of high-profile politicians do.

&#x200B;

But the comment above was made by someone in response to calling out multibillion dollar companies for paying little to nothing in net taxes. Talk about friendly fire: A low tier multimillionaire vs the goings-on of corporations that rake in billions every year. This isn't even a hypothetical of ad absurdum; this is actually absurd. You can't equate the two.

I know that the words ""million"" and ""billion"" all kind blend together in a foggy haze when working class people struggle to keep salaries in the low 5-figures, but we can't forget that the difference between the true 0.1% and the so called ""upper class"" is even greater than that of the latter and the working class.

Maybe we once did have actual class warfare, once upon a time, but that time is past. The 0.1% have somehow made the upper class a scapegoat and pitted the poor against the poor. All the while, corporations make anti-consumer decisions to pad their bottom line (to the tune of their beloved nightingale investors and board members), and, when these decisions backfire following the rejection by the general public (as the true free market should dictate), they and their lobbyists get entire governments to subsidise their ""mistakes"", with money they collect from the working class, no less.

The sooner the general public realises that the sensationalism, the serialisation and the publicisation of politics and media, the sooner we realise that we the 99% have very little that divides us. We just need a taste of how much we have in common, how much you can love and empathise with your neighbours. The sooner we realise that our blue shirts and red caps are rank way lower than the very real issue of workers rights violation. The 0.1% know this very well. They love and trust each other in their own way. They look out for each other, in their own way.",1644327120.0

snk6tm,Do my bosses hate workers with disabilities?,20,0.95,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snk6tm/do_my_bosses_hate_workers_with_disabilities/,9,"I work for the North America Immigration Law Group/WeGreened network of companies and the way the owners treat my disabled coworkers is really gross.

As some backstory, we’ve been forming a union for a couple years now and recently had what’s called a “unit hearing.” Basically, this means that lawyers and the government call you in to testify about what your job is. You get subpoenaed to testify so you’re legally unable to refuse to go.

Anyways, one of my coworkers gets subpoenaed to the hearing. So she goes – all good, right? Wrong. Ends up, she’s on the spectrum and had arranged with her training manager to get flexible deadlines for her work. This is a reasonable accommodation for her disability and doesn’t hurt the company at all, but she had only been granted this accommodation by her direct supervisor and hadn’t gone to HR about it (precisely because she was afraid of discrimination if she told people outside of her team).

So one of the company’s owners sees her at the hearing (something she couldn’t refuse to go to) and starts examining her deadlines. He sees that her deadlines are different than other peoples and confronts her one on one. He grills her about her deadlines and then personally revokes her disability accommodations. Obviously, this is illegal (violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act), but he doesn’t care. And now she can’t do her job and has to take an extended medical leave while she hires a lawyer and tries to sort everything out. If she didn’t have family support, she could quite literally be homeless right now because her disability limits the kinds of jobs that she’s able to take.

Another one of my co-workers was subpoenaed to testify but doesn’t have quite the same job, so there aren’t deadlines for the bosses to examine. Even before she testified, both of the company’s owners identified her as a union supporter and were clogging up her DMs, taking away her assistant (which people in her position typically have), and increasing her workload. After she testifies, the owners keep interrogating her about her job. Eventually, all this puts her on medical leave because, between not having an assistant and being constantly harassed by the bosses, the stress from work gives her a mental breakdown. So during her leave, she gets a lawyer and works out disability accommodations with HR. After these accommodations were worked out, the HR manager who set them up was dismissed or quit, and she was told that she could not have those accommodations anymore. My co-worker was then put on an “indefinite suspension” the day she was supposed to return to office, and the company ultimately terminated her for downloading files that she couldn’t have done her job without.

These aren’t the only stories I could share but I’ll leave it here for now. I can post more in the comments or do a follow-up post or something if people want.

TL;DR: My bosses used my co-workers’ disabilities as weapons to punish them for testifying in response to subpoenas.

snfsy0,Employee almost destroys business,0,0.28,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snfsy0/employee_almost_destroys_business/,37,"If this is not the correct place to post this, please feel free to let me know. But I have been a part of this forum for quite a while and feel like I could use some insight from more people.

I own and operate a small business we’re more / less in the software industry. We have a few employees and a few contractors that work for us.

A few months ago, an employee asked me for a pay raise, and I explained due to the slowness of business, I could not provide a pay raise at the time. But any new projects that come in, I would make sure he is assigned team lead, which will boost his hours. Which I am perfectly OK with because of his seniority.

He did express he was upset, which I fully understand. I was very transparent and willing to show our financial books, as we are a small business and have nothing to hide.

Eventually, he did agree. We had a few new projects come in, and as stated, I made him team lead on all of the projects. 

Through one customer complaint, I slowly discovered he was sabotaging all of the new incoming projects and attempting to do the same to support previous projects we worked on. Though I already had a fail-safe in place for any previous projects. But the damage had already been done who is the new projects. In the long run, we settled with all customers and returned all of their money, well utilizing myself and other employees to deliver the product.
All in all, this employee cost us around 20k USD.
For the employee, he can sleep at night knowing oh well f* the man, being me in this case. I can’t sleep at night knowing that we almost lost our business, and our name has been tarnished for good because of this.

So my question
1. everyone, I understand you want better pay, better hours, better benefits. But for small businesses that can’t necessarily afford to pay more, what could we do to show our employees their values and not run into situations like this again?

2. At the end of the day, if your job does not give you what you want, usually paying more pay, why is it perceived as OK to sabotage them?

Because I often do see that on this form of those people planning their employer sabotage usually for not getting better pay.

Please don’t get me wrong; I’m fully in agreement that some of these extremely profitable companies worth multi-millions and billions should pay their employees more and have better benefits. But we are a very small business that can’t necessarily afford to do the same. Now, if we are ever worth millions, then we can be the start of the change. But as a small business, it is not possible right now.

EDIT
I’m sorry I should’ve clarified the pay structure. If you’re working on one project, your paid 1x your hourly. However, if you’re working on more than one project, i.e., multitasking, you’re paid your hourly per each project.",1644310950.0

While virtually everyone can agree on this fact, what does it have to do with anti-work? Everything.

You ever make any kind of art in your free time? Music? Drawings? Fiction? It's WORK, but many, if not most to all, of us do it anyway. And we do it for \*gasp\* NO PAY.

But surely if everyone is free to make art, this isn't going to make a great anti-work take, right? WRONG. How free are you to WORK on your passions if you have to spend 60+ hours working two shitty jobs just to get by? No one has infinite spoons. 

But it's even worse than that. Even if you are one of the lucky ones that has the time and budget to pursue your passions, what if the vast majority of the creative geniuses living in your society are burdened with an absurd load of menial labor? Do you think that might just really suck in principle? Do you think that, maybe, you'd live in a place with unnecessarily shitty art? Maybe that might be glaringly obvious in some way? 

Date Movie MADE $65 MILLION IN PROFIT (300+% ROI) at the box office alone. 

The deeper issue is that free markets are fucking awful at determining the value of some things. Maybe the movie market could make sense under different circumstances, but when markets also determine the price of basic human needs AND the value of the labor that the humans have to sell to pay for their basic human needs, well shit gets all fucked up.

When people aren't forced to do shit jobs, they work on the things they love. And it just so happens that work has a way of benefiting many more people. It's long past time that we built a society on human values, and not on the whims of the invisible hand.",1644307240.0

Where do I start? I left my ""comfortable"" job back in April 2021 for a great job (or so I thought) opportunity with better pay. I was constantly harassed by the person training me and management did absolute nothing when I brought it to their attention. It was toxic. I hated every day of my life when I worked there. It was absolutely chaos. I would literally come home and cry to my husband EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I ended up getting ""laid off"" less than two months into the job. It was a huge hit on my ego since it was the first job I was ever fired from (""laid off"") due to performance. I was so embarrassed especially since I was always a top performer at all my previous jobs. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward, I found out I was pregnant shortly after getting laid off (first time pregnancy). My husband and I were beyond excited - we're high school sweethearts and had been waiting for this moment forever. He started buying furniture to build a nursery in our home. I started having some health issues and was told I was anemic and had low blood pressure. We went to our first ultrasound at 10 weeks. I was told I had a blighted ovum and would be miscarrying in the weeks to follow. We were heartbroken beyond words. I felt worthless and torn to pieces. I ended up having the miscarriage at home and suffered excruciating pain. I can't even describe what I went through. I was a mess. I was still not working so I was home all day. All I would think about was sleeping so I would not be ""living"" this nightmare. When I was awake, all I would think about was ending my life. It was torture. I hated myself. I still wanted to try for another baby but had to wait 3 months before trying again.

&#x200B;

I ended up getting covid during that 3 month wait and suffered from it really bad. I had pneumonia and ended up in the hospital during that time. I recovered after a few weeks.  Almost two months had passed by when I found out I was pregnant again. I was so happy to be pregnant again. I was driving home one day when an idiot ran past a stop sign and hit my car. I was t-boned on my passenger side and was just in shock. It was my first car accident and my mind was still processing everything. All that ran through my mind during the impact was my pregnancy. Long story short, I ended up spotting shortly after and was taken to the hospital where I was told I was having yet another miscarriage. I felt completely numb. I thought I knew what depression was until that second miscarriage happened. It got 20x worse. It feels like every time I try to get myself out of that dark place, I keep getting pulled in deeper. 

&#x200B;

It is so hard to show up to work everyday (new job) and act like I am okay when I'm not. My boss just announced her third pregnancy following my second miscarriage which has been very hard on me. I'm happy for her but can't help but feel  resentment. I feel like a horrible person. I don't share personal information to any of my coworkers so no one knows what I have been dealing with these past months aside from getting covid and being in a car accident. I have been at this job for about 5 months now and I just want to quit. I don't feel mentally stable to be at work. I hate my current job and feel like it is only adding to my stress. I feel like the best thing to do would be to just take a break from work all together and focus on my mental health before I completely lose it. I want to quit my job but I don't know what's holding me back. I still need to do something where I can have some income coming in obviously just enough to pay bills.

My SO and I had applied for a rental, and they needed my work contact to verify my income and all that. No problem. I didn’t lie on the application, I wrote down my gross monthly income as they had asked. 

The following week (last week), my superintendent was doing a walk-around and stopped to chat with our crew (Myself, a couple other guys and our foreman). He’s an engineer, has never picked up a tool in his life, and has that “I’m better than you dirty workers” attitude. I could be wrong, but just my opinion. 

So he brings up that he got a call about my application. And in front of my fellow workers and foreman, he says “Yeah, and they said you told them you make $_____ per month? Come on” and rolled his eyes with a chuckle. 

What he doesn’t know, is that I know how much he makes. And it’s about $70,000 less than I make. Yes, he’s salary blah blah blah, it’s different than working hourly. The fact that he felt the need to call me out (wrongly) in front of others, including saying what I make out loud, really showed me how much management doesn’t respect us who are the ones building things with our hands. Thankfully my foreman had my back and told the Super “Why, that’s pretty accurate, how much did you think he makes?”

The trunk of that tree are the people in power and control of the government. The branches are the banks and for profit prisons. The twigs are the corporations, and the leaves are the CEOs/executives. America is a diseased forest. 

We are the forest floor that enables the symbiosis from the bottom up. 

We can spring into action to erode this forest away. We can cure it of the disease that is spreading through the world. One by one. One fallen leaf, branch, twig, pine needle, soil clump, and microorganism at a time. We can erode this forest away!! It’s going to take a mass flooding event to make an impact. This forest has old deep roots, but just like a natural disaster, we can destroy the trunk. And just like mushrooms that network to give nutrition to the trees, we can network en mass to create a big enough impact to decimate this plague on our earth!

Their goal is to decimate the middle class in order to create a thick forest floor so their roots go even deeper; enabling them to become stronger by feeding off our precious lives spent working for their benefit.

But there is something they don’t want us to recognize.

The more leaves and branches on the forest floor, the healthier the soil becomes. We are stronger together, that’s why they try so hard to divide us!!! We can bind together as one to finally #cancelcapitalsm and restore the forest in a healthy way. 

They want us to believe that they have all the power, when the power truly lies within each and every one of you microorganisms. We are the health that is holding this toxic forest together. And we waste our health mentally and physically to sustain their toxicity. 

No more!!!

Without the forest floor there is no forest! We are what is holding this thing together. Don’t forget it! Without us, there is no them. 

The power lies within us!

We need to take their health and powers away. They have managed their forest in a toxic way for far too long! It is costing us our precious time and energy on this earth. We need to use our energy more to create massive waves that flood and erode this forest away. 

I see all the positive stuff coming out of this movement, and it’s gaining traction. I’m so thankful for all the people putting in so much effort to create a healthier forest for all. For good! It cannot happen fast enough. I know it will take time, but I am beyond upset at what our world has become. The capitalism disease has spread to every corner of this planet. The more capitalism spreads, the stronger it becomes. I want nothing but good for all of humanity and Mother Earth. 

The frustration has built up, much like a caged tiger. 

I could go on and on about the toxicity that is America and how it’s narcissistic tendencies have spread like wildfire. I’m certain that you brilliant people get the idea I’m putting across. I just need to get this out as poetically as possible and maybe I sparked something within the community. All of us matter so much to this change.

It's a great long read but in case it's too long (it is long!) I summarized it for all of us!

**TL;DR:**

* **Since 2017, private-equity backed firms like Greystar have done rapid takeovers of apt. buildings all over the US. Private equity takeovers of housing has led to soaring rents (sometimes +25% in a year), no hot water sometimes, the PE firms not paying for trash pickup (leaving scattered trash everywhere) and reducing security guard patrols.**
* **Of 35 biggest multifamily apt building owners, now almost HALF of the owners are private equity.**
* **These PE firms flip these buildings, then unload them for profit. These PE-led apt. housing funds try to return 20% compared 4% for regular real investment trusts. Greystar CEO Bob Faith has bragged about these returns.**
* **Freddie Mac has enabled these firms, accounting for 85% of biggest apt. bldg. purchases. After Freddie issues the loan, it allows PE firms to jack rent with no tenant protection. Blackstone was also accused of tenant abuse in 2017.**
* **Biggest PE firms involved have been Greystar, Southern Management, Lone Star, Irvine Co. and Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, & Starwood Capital. Both Goldman & Starwood were implicated in fraud in ANOTHER ProPublica study called ""The Bigger Short"" on commercial real estate fraud.**
* **Firms like Blackstone fight regulation; they spent nearly $83 million in California to fight rent control measures, 3x their opponents'.**
* **This is happening under a housing crunch over the past few years, as many of these firms took advantage of the boost in renters from the 2008 crash, and even more so now during the pandemic.**

I am a developer on a very small team for a small company and we are all 1099. This is my first dev job and I've been there about a year.
I was given this internal customer support app to work on alone. Fine. But given just one 3 week sprint to do it during which I was on vacation for the 1st week after handoff of the design. Then I got covid. 
Basically I didn't get it completed in time even though it was a non-essential app and i completed what I could complete without the rest of the api's (which my boss still hasnt given me) the next week. 
Today my boss has a talk with me about the hours I've billed for Jan. Essentially accusing me of not having worked the hours I billed. Because the code that I did do on a separate branch wasn't merged into development before the end of that sprint. 
It had a file structure,  api call, types, slices/reducers, components, a few feature pages. He refused to even look at the branch and just kept referencing how he hadn't seen anything in development.  
Nevermind that I got the entire app finished the following week. 
This is a rant but I could just cry. They keep piling more and more shit onto us. We rebuilt the entire front end for web and mobile in like 5 months and they just keep adding external apps and more features at the speed of light. 
We don't even have our FE TESTED because we have no time and it's never prioritized in sprints.
Then in this discussion he was like 'I really like you as a person and you have a great opportunity here. But this can't happen again' and I was like 'what go on vacation and then get covid????' 
He just kept saying how it's such a good opportunity to work with so many skilled people. Meanwhile neither of our 2 seniors has any time for mentorship and one can barely speak English. The guy who doesn't know much English is very smart and talented but it can be hard to get feedback or ask him for help because it's awkward having to ask him to repeat himself 5 times. 
Anyway during this convo he also told me that there aren't many jobs out there for people who aren't senior devs (a lie) and basically insinuated that I should stay and learn and just, I don't know not get sick I guess. 

I'm just so done. He wouldn't even look at the code that I had written in January. He just had this narrative that because the entire app wasn't done in time I hadn't done enough work.

I've been crying since I got home.

The curriculum I developed at my soon-to-be-ex job was something I poured my heart and soul into. I *love* nature, I loved getting to manage a garden, I love teaching kids about the world around them! I loved getting to play a big role in the community. I loved the kids.

My one manager said it was ""inevitable that someone as talented as [me]"" would want to leave the organization in search of bigger things. But it really wasn't. I could've done this job forever. It's been the stress and disorganization and, frankly, the bullying (thanks other manager!) that broke me down.

The kids'll miss me. The organization (even the bits of it that bullied me) is gonna miss me. The plants will miss me; I get sad knowing a bunch of them will probably die without my care. Getting a ""better job"" doesn't feel like a victory, and I can't explain that to the people congratulating me.

It's partly guilt, but not just that. I want to live in a world where I didn't *have* to get a better job to keep living :c

What I've witnessed locally and on reddit is the fact that someone believes they know better and prevents any kind of negotiation. 

If you are older you are inclined to say you know more because you have been around longer. But what happens when someone younger with more education tries to correct that person? They are told they are wrong or don't know better. 

On a more local level I can detect just pure hate, like everyone a generation above me have lost hope and have nothing but anger left. You try to tell them you want change or you have a different opinion and you are told to be quiet. 

I've met only a couple of older people who truly will take what you say and constructively think about it and they are usually teachers, people who are literally a part of education. 

I also know, with people in general, that there is usually just bad apples while the other apples are fine, they just don't stink and grab attention. There is also the whole tribalistic nature of people to choose safety with those that think similarly. So I'm conflicted with blaming groups of people because of age. It gets hard when all I keep seeing are bad apples and I'm not supposed to choose sides.

An non-important example is I believe I have an anxiety disorder of some kind, I personally feel anxious for no reason and it's uncomfortable. I was like this ever since i could remember. I explain this to my parent and they tell me ""quit being anxious"" but I can't, I would if I could. ""You are the only thing that controls anxiety so stop being anxious,"" just seems very unsupportive. This pushes me to find things that make me numb or forget about personal and nationwide issues.

A wider scope example is Socialism vs Capitalism. If I even brought up the word Socialism to my elders I would be marked a communist and evil. But I am starting to think a change in the system could have a *chance* to be better. Look at the many countries in Europe who have democratic socialism. Norway has always popped up on reddit with statistics that blow American statistics out of the water. Socialism also seems to align with Christian teachings, and when it comes to religion here it's something you don't mess with. Of course there are pros and cons to everything but sometimes the pros outweigh the cons.

It's like all the wars, conflict, paranoia, xenophobia sucked the souls of my elders, makes them scared of things that are different. Because they made it where they are it shows that their method and this system works in a sense but couldn't it work better? Keep people from being taken advantage of, keep people healthy, allow people to leave work for vacation or to care for new family while being financially cared for. Norway provides all of this and has almost the same amount of taxes.

What is even weirder is my anxiety seems to stop when I discuss important issues, issues regarding daily life and American government, idk why I'm scared/anxious, I usually try to apply logic and understanding to conquer fear but maybe I have seen and read too much.",1644287128.0

A few ideas I've gathered so far:

\-Get a job with a 4 days a week instead of 5 d/week

\-Work part-time and massively decrease living expenses - of which the biggest one is housing. (E.g., live with multiple roommates, live in a van)

\-Go the other away and instead of decreasing work, increase it. Somehow be able to work 2+ jobs with the goal of retiring ASAP.

I talk to my boss who isn't sure on this but wanted to get everyone's thoughts.

Friday, about 30 minutes before all of our third parties closed, we received a call saying that images weren't loading correctly. Alright, easy, I open a ticket with the correct 3rd Party, inform the entire company - there's only about 10 of us - and clocked out for the day.

As I'm on my way home, the same company submitted an email ticket for the exact same issue. I reminded the company of what was going on and enjoyed my weekend.

I got in today, and as soon as I put my backpack down, I was talked to about the ticket. Apparently, I should have called the company the second it came in despite having a phone conversation with them 45 minutes prior to the email ticket.

I've been told I need to be available until 6 PM, meaning my hours have moved to 8 AM to 6 PM - my previous hours were 8 AM to about 4 PM (salaried so I've just been eating lunch at my desk for the earlier go home time, had 0 issues until today).

On top of all of this, I am the only person in my department. I used to have help, but they fired him in November and I've been the sole Customer Support Rep since then, which is worse because we have an on call phone that only I have had since then. I keep getting told they'll hire people for me to be in charge of, ""minions"" as they call them, but I've been promised the additional help since my coworker was fired. Im beginning to doubt it'll ever happen.

Today I began looking for a new job. Is this an overreaction?",1644274009.0

This was the final straw in why I hung it up for good.

I was an Executive Chef for a nationwide chain. The job required a ton of my time and overall being, I was barely home and when I was I was sleeping or working more. This company was bought out in a huge deal and overnight everything changed. Positions were eliminated, they kept trying to get me to take a pay cut, the list goes way fucking on. So, I started looking for a new gig. I got hooked up with a well known Chef and restaurant group looking to fill an executive position and it was a great fit, or so I thought. 

I went through 5 months of interviews both in person and on the phone, I answered a 250 question personality test, met with every single important person that I could have possibly met with. I finally get the offer to come in and stage. For anybody who doesn't know, a ""stage"" is basically a cooking audition, you go in and make some shit and if they like it you typically get the job. I was asked to make 5 separate dishes. When I presented the dishes everyone was there, all the high up dicks. They ate it ALL and had good feedback with some normal critique as well but it was an overwhelmingly positive response. The chef tells me he will call within the next couple days to confirm an offer and starting date. He ghosts me for over a week. I finally call him and to see what's been happening and he says that I will need to apply again. I was very confused, I asked about all the interviews and the stage and also the application I had submitted months prior. Somewhere over the course of the week that he ghosted me they must have found someone cheaper because their opinion of me and my food had completely changed. He even said he wouldn't recommend me for any other positions. I was at an absolute loss for words. I just hung up the phone up and decided I would never again be taken advantage of. 

I've experienced so much illegal shit working in the food industry, the wage theft and labor exploitation is just incredible. We should start a subreddit that everyone posts all the jobs they've had and the salaries they had. We need to turn this system on it's fucking head. 

TL;DR: quit one job for another, went through 5 months of intense interviewing and salary negotiations only to be turned away at the last minute as if they had never met me.",1644273621.0

Especially the fire alarm and temperature? (they are still happening). I work in the US for a big retail store. Sorry for any typos. 

- broken fire alarm system that beeps every day. A manager told me the whole system needs to be replaced but the company is too cheap to do it. I hear it through my whole shift sometimes. 
- Toilet that breaks down a lot
- Cluttered break space. Sometimes is full of uboats. It does not have much room to reach the lockers or sit down. 
- Door doesn’t work and will stay open. Even when it was snowing outside no one came to fix it.  It’s very cold in there. To the point where my coworker have to wear their jackets, hats, and sometimes gloves.
-  No heat. Even when we are constantly closing the door it’s extremely cold. Especially the back room. My hands are freezing most of the time. It feels like it’s as cold as outside. It’s not kept at a reasonable temperature and my hands sometimes hurt after work. 
- Sometimes they don’t fire people. They just taking them off the schedule and will avoid answering their calls.
- I’ve heard my manager state on several  occasions how she would not hire an more women because we “needed” men to do heavy lifting jobs. I’ve also heard her say that my coworkers age didn’t matter and that he needed to push himself to keep up with case count. 
- We don’t enforce the mask mandate. I did for a while but it was obvious that the managers didn’t care so I stopped saying something. I didn’t want to be harassed by customers without support. They won’t stand up for us. Even when the customers are being incredibly nasty and disrespectful. They’ll just complain in the back like the rest of us. 
- Made us open the store even though it had flooded over night. Over night ppl spend the shift cleaning the place. Me and the morning manager continued moping in the morning and put wet floor signs everywhere. The supervisor wanted all stores open by 8am. 
- Sometimes they’ll make random phone calls canceling shifts because they’re over hours. 
-  Changing shift schedule and not informing us on time.
 I’d like to mention that two of my managers have mentioned calling 311. I’m just not sure if it’s actually possible. Or if I can do it anonymously. I’d appreciate advice.",1644272193.0

In-system activism utilizes existing avenues of political, legal, and economic influence seeking, ultimately, policy change. In-system activism doesn't see the structure of the system itself as a problem or at least it doesn't act like it does. There is no shortage of activists out there writing books, making media, and holding events surrounding the idea of system level change, talked about all the time. But if you look closely, that's not actually what they're proposing. What they call system change is just the add-on of more regulatory patches or policies. In fact, the very term has become a terrible misnomer thrown around with no distinction, even here on this subreddit. Everyone likes to drop statements about how this ""system"" we have is corrupt, or incompatible, or wrong, or inhumane yet virtually no mainstream activists that say these things actually approach it from that position. They are still operating in-system.

In contrast, out-system activism sees the entire socioeconomic structure rooted in the market economy as too limited in its potential expression, too limited in what it's capable of adapting to, to be useful in the long run. It can't solve the problems inherently and hence, true activism today must come from outside of what the system supports, forcing structural change, not policy change. The structuralist movement, if you want to call it that, people that think this way is interested in structural change, not policy change. And it isn't to say that improvements can't be made using tools of policy, but the inhibition inherent to fight back will always come from the root of the system itself, making any seeming advancements in policy tenuous and easy to overturn in time.",1644266638.0

A few years ago  I remember spending around 100 bucks a week on groceries for myself.

I went around two times a month and averaged like 110~ to give me two weeks worth of food. Now the thing is im pretty small and don't eat much to begin with so stretching this out was alright.

Now I live with my wonderful partner and by some fantastic lucky stars have landed ourselves a house completely due to luck at my mom's wisdom so start saving WHEN I WAS IN UTERO. (i am now 28) so I'm forever grateful to her for this chance at a comfortable life. 

We are paying off utilities, sewage etc. ourselves and recieving help from her for food. I try to keep this number as low as possible for a lot of reasons. 

Recently we've landed on spending around just under 200 every two weeks for groceries but I feel like we have like no food after 4 days or so.

We get things like rice, cabbage, ramen packs, cereal normal things. Occasionally i'll buy like a ten dollar flower pot for funsies?? but I'm really aiming for cheap brands and things we can use for meal prep. No fancy meats or organic high end shit.

I have some sort of adhd/autism combo that makes me forget to eat so I'll sometimes go a few days on like 3 ""real"" meals. My partner thankfully eats like a normal human and reminds me to feed myself. 

Despite this I feel like I'm CONSTANTLY running out of food. We barely eat and 200 seems like SO MUCH to be spending on food... but now i feel like with inflation i think i might be over limiting my spending. Though the money isn't exactly mine so I don't want to go crazy either.

After my managers and higher paid coworkers were talking about how crazy it is that some people can't afford to get their car fixed. I stared at them like they had 15 heads because I finally realized they have literally zero idea what it means to be poor or to just live paycheck to paycheck. 

My manager keeps telling us that it's not about the money, it's about the patients and if we're in it for the money then he doesn't want those kind of people working for him. So 19 people called off and now he's stressed because a bunch of people either walked out or turned in a notice. I guess the ""hidden hero discount"" doesn't work on bills in the real world??  🤔

Twelve years ago I was happily employed minding my own business when a recruiter reached out to me for what would have been a promotion and a pay raise.  I went through multiple rounds of interviews and everyone liked me and I was excited about the job.  A few days later they called with the offer.

**The offer:**

A lower title with less responsibility than I currently had.  To make it even more enticing they wanted to pay me 10% less than what I was already earning.

Needless to say this was not the promotion and pay raise they used to entice me to interview with them.

**My response:**

Gentlemen,
 
Thank you for the offer for Sr. Consultant with your organization.  I appreciate the time, effort, and attention that went into your decision.  While I believe XXXXX has a lot to offer and opportunity to grow I do not believe it is prudent for me to take a reduction in responsibility, authority, and pay at this time.
 
I wish you all the best in the coming year and perhaps there will be additional opportunities then that will be beneficial to us both.
 
Thank you again but at this time I must respectfully decline your offer.
 
Sincerely,

**Their reaction:**  

*If there is another opportunity* you will have to prove to us why we should consider you.

Needless to say I had dodged a bullet.

Not sure How to Proceed,13,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smz23f/may_be_jobless_not_sure_how_to_proceed/,3,"So, I posted a few months ago about how my company was scamming the employees out of overtime pay over the holidays, but I sadly stuck around a bit longer. I was hired there 6 months ago to be the general manager, but after I began, the owner's son basically decided he liked the management position and has been unwilling to let me do my job. We have been butting heads constantly for these 6 months, but he just undercuts and overrules me almost out of spite and without communication. That, and stealing my ideas to implement them as his own. I've tried to speak to the owner (who doubles as HR), but my emails and phone calls have gone unanswered. 

I've essentially been shoved into doing anything the son doesn't want to do himself which is primarily the administrative and customer work. I'm constantly cleaning up after the messes he makes because he often acts before thinking and prioritizes things in really illogical ways. Also, I was promised a host of benefits including a company vehicle, cell phone, expense account, ect. that I have not received nor are they willing to discuss it. I finally hit my limit last week after receiving a customer expedite request. I found the product in question, spoke with the person who would be working on it and verified he wasn't working on anything pressing, and asked that the expedite be the next job filled. Not a problem. 

After I walk away, the son approaches the person I just spoke to and told them to ignore me as he had a different project. I saw this transpiring and walked up probably a bit more aggressively than needed but just asked if there was a problem. I was then admonished in front of the staff being told that the problem is that I keep going behind him and changing his plans. I informed him we share a problem in that he changes my plans. Then the shout of ""Well, I'm the one in f-ing charge!"" just caused me to have enough. I informed him I was going home and did so. 

I have been trying to speak with the owner since, and have yet to receive a call or email. I don't want to go back without a conversation, but feel like this is the end of my employment. There are plenty of other issues I could discuss (like the throwing knife board on the floor). I took less salary, less vacation, and increased my commute for this position because I was told I would be able to manage it as I saw fit with little influence from the ownership. That, and the other benefits I never was given. Not really sure how to proceed from here. Any ideas?

I am a Sr. Loan Processor. We have been demanded to work 6 day weeks ever since the Covid housing boom started - even though when we were hired we were promised we would only have to work 1 weekend per month. I have averaged 50+ hours a week, and give up a lot of my personal free time to be available nights and weekends as that's when borrowers are usually home and able to answer questions and submit documentation to complete their loans. 

I just got off of a conference call where 29 people including myself were mass fired. Apparently we don't even deserve a one on one anymore, as we were lead like lambs to the slaughter of our livelihoods. This was just one in a series of mass firings, but it really caught me off guard as I was a top producer just last year. I am guessing the reason I was included has to do with my performance at the end of December through January: my grandmother contracted Covid in December and suffered a massive heart attack that took her life in early January. This woman had a big hand in raising me, we were very close. I got 5 days off which were used crying, consoling family, searching through her things for photos and burial garments, and attending the funeral... and when I came back to work I was still devastated but I did my best and ended up in the bottom half production-wise. I guess that's all it takes, a couple slow months and no humanity from an upper management who just sees us as numbers. 

My emotions have ran the gambit from terrified to angry to hysterical. If this has happened to you, please know you are not alone. I don't know how I'm going to pay my own mortgage now (how is that for irony) but I have been down before and I never stay down long. This subreddit gives me a lot of faith.

Over the past 3 years it's become almost impossible to buy so I won't be talking about buying, just renting. Even now the house I am in currently, which isn't mine, went from 149k brand new to resell of almost 500k. That's why I'm not going to talk about buying.

So I looked for just a one bedroom apartment. Cheapest one I found that actually is almost never available because how ""cheap"" it is would be 995 a month 700 sqft. You would have to pay utilities. Normally cheapest I've been able to find over the last year range from 1100 to 1300 for same size. Let's go with the 995 one though.

Minimum wage being 7.25 you would bring home about 1160 before tax. Based off when I was single and no kids and did my w4 how it was recommended I was taxed 200 per check. Don't know if it's normal or not but I'm going to go with that. So let's take the 400 out and you are left with 760. Only 760 to try and live for a month. Can't afford even the cheapest 1 bedroom apartment with that.

Let's look at 15 an hour. Same apartment and everything. If you work 8 hours every work day you bring home 2400 before tax, using the same tax as above we will take 400 out with tax leaving 2000. Let's take rent out of 995. 1005 left. Utilities I will count power, gas, and internet because it's pretty much a necessity now so let's say sparingly 200 a month for utilities which it's on the low side but we will go with it. 805 left. Water is paid for by landlord.

Let's just get some basic stuff now. Car insurance I'll say 100 because that's what I got my rate at first starting out. We will do 80 for gas for the car and thats just for work. Cellphone bill of 75. We are at 550 left. Now food. With current food prices I'd say 300 a month for food for a single person. 150 for 2 weeks seems pretty reasonable. Of course could live off Ramen if you wanted but I'm thinking a ok meal for every meal. 

Now we are at 250 left. That's not counting streaming stuff and the odd and end stuff let alone health insurance but it's enough to get by. Now that 1 bedroom apartment has gone up by 100 a month every year. Last year it was 895. So if prices keep inflating like they are currently, this single person would be able to live at this place for at max 2 years with rent, food, utilities, and gas cost going up. 

My point? 15 an hour would be only be sustainable for a year, maybe 2. If we are going to fight to change minimum wage, we need to look at the actual long term. Minimum wage is supposed to be liveable and to me, a single person trying to live in a one bedroom apartment that is in no way shape or form fancy or upgraded or in a prime spot to live should be the staple of liveable.

As I was doing so I heard something tear at first I thought it was my shirt or pants but when I went to pick up the next bucket of paint I felt an immense pain coming from my left shoulder. I figured it’d go away as we always get injured but I tend to just “work it off” but this time the pain remained. I spoke to my supervisor and they sent me to a clinic (the doctors are ass) They put me on restricted work (can’t lift or push/pull more than 5lbs, as well as not being able to raise my hands above my head) so technically everything I do for work. I told my supervisor about this who tells me to stay home due to the fact I won’t be able to do anything regarding work fast forward to today the bosses wife sends me a text telling me that they will be using my sick pay for the days I missed.

I about crapped my pants when I figured out how much more I could make.  This new company works on ‘public’ construction projects like roads and government buildings. All of this Public work is covered under this federal construction minimum wage law (which supersedes regular minimum wage law) called Davis Bacon although it only applies when the Federal Govt is paying for all or some of the project.

Anyways all employers have to pay there workers these ‘construction minimum wages’ on these government projects. Don’t get screwed over.

It goes without saying that the US is ass, but as the saying goes “the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t know”. 

More than this, I think people tend to forget that there is no economic equity without racial equity. As long as ANYONE is allowed to be the “other”, there will always be a method for exploitation of workers. I’ve seen too many people say “regardless of race, it’s capitalism that’s wrong!” And yeah, capitalism is ass but the whole American economy that we complain about is built off of oppression of indigenous people and enslaved Africans.

I'm based in Canada (New Brunswick), and want to know if my employer can pursue defamation claims if I email my call floor coworkers (call center) about wage disparity from our company. We're paid hourly at the lowest pay bracket in our industry, and when I questioned my ops manager and company president about this information, they found a work order I missed to suspend me for 3 days without pay.

It's obviously retaliatory, but I can't do anything about it because the missed work order ""technically"" exists. It's the kind of shit they've let slide many times before, but now I'm being seen as a disgruntled employee and they're posturing to get me out the door.

I'm a 5 year employee, and after questioning provincial labor laws basically they can legally terminate me without any explanation as long as they pay 4 weeks lieu of notice. Our provincial body said I could pursue severance claims in civil court but honestly that prob isn't worth the time energy or expense. Best case I can mass-email my coworkers the wage information, and thus put pressure on the employer, as long as they can't sue me. Let me know if you have any resources.

I’m not anti-work. A society without work at all would be absolute chaos. There would be no collective goal to work towards, and no motivation. Most of these issues boil down to how people think they can treat each other, and what they think they can get away with.. in terms of pay.. benefits.. etc. I’m pro human rights.. pro workers’ rights. 

In terms of what I get materially in exchange for my labor, it’s not too bad. My pay rate at this job is okay. I would say that’s fair. They’re a bit cheap with the health coverage plans and don’t offer anything like dental or vision (at least, that’s what I was told). In retrospect, there were some major red flags that came up when I first started there that I probably should not have ignored. All of the employees talk smack behind each other’s backs every day. As soon as the individual in question turns to leave and walks out the door, someone is gossiping or making a derogatory comment about them. There’s a lot of disfunction that goes on because it comes from the top down.. which would obviously be due to the way things are managed.. and would sit outside the jurisdiction of a base employee. I do my best to push work through, keep my head down, and ask questions only when necessary. No need to try and trudge through decades’ worth of drama. 

I also heard some horror stories about what had happened at this place during inclement weather in the past. They once had all of their staff come in the whole week after a hurricane, with no power. Nobody could do any work. They just sat around, and chatted in the dark. This meant no hot water and no way by which to cook food. Everyone commented on how stupid that was. They also commented about how unsafe it was.. because the work building is located in a rather unsavory neighborhood. 

During the recent ice storm that came through last Thursday, about half of my work building lost power. On the way in that morning I had slid on the road three times because it was sleeting. I thought about turning around before I even got there.. but stuck it out that full day because I knew management was a bit strict. Unfortunately, at home I lost full power that same night. The internal temperature became so cold overnight that my fish didn’t make it. My dad offered to come pick me up and take me out of town.. because he had power. Since the electricity was out.. I could manually open the garage door but couldn’t close it. Therefore I missed work the following Friday. I emailed in to work Thursday night.. before leaving town.. giving all the details about where I was going.. as well as a picture of the city outage map. 

This morning, my manager calls me into the break room to tell me I’m suspended for the rest of the day without pay, because everybody else came in Friday. To be fair to the situation.. I did not call in on the phone. However, I had been out with an infected dog bite some months ago, and sent most of that correspondence through email. It didn’t seem unusual to me. 

I explained carefully that I sent an email beforehand and offered to show it again. He said he did not care. 

We went into the office of one of the owners... I explained the full situation and what had happened. He shared the same attitude as my manager. He did not care to know, he rationalized this behavior towards me as being fair - because his power was still out and he came in to work anyway. Guess he had been stewing in the cold dark for several days. But I wasn’t about to apologize for having my own contingency plan. It truly isn’t my fault for making my own best decision when work is all any of these other people seem to live for. 

He said I “wasn’t anymore special than anyone else”. They “try to be fair but see no reason why I should get special treatment.” He said the world “did not revolve around me”. He also said he “has kids.. and understands, sometimes people have to learn the hard way”.  I apologized for the miscommunication and explained that my attitude was not about laziness or shrugging off responsibility. 

In summary.. I missed work Friday and they had no backup in terms of having somebody run the graphic images out. So because the work did not get done that day.. it’s a better idea to send me home for another day, while either the work goes untouched or somebody else is having to juggle both their job and mine today? 

I could be wrong.. but wasn’t that the whole reason I was in trouble to begin with? 

Does not running in to work like a mindless lemming, and instead trying to take care of an unusual circumstance the best I could make me special or entitled? I guess so. 

One of them enjoys reading this subreddit on the daily.. living vicariously through the people who aren’t afraid to say and do things to stand up to problematic behavior. If you’re reading this now - it’s too bad about all the snow days you missed over the course of 15 years. It’s also too bad to see that despite knowing this was a simple error in communication, you still chose to side with the problem that keeps you consuming this content. 

Personally if it were me.. I would’ve closed my doors Thursday night and given everyone Friday off.. paid. I care about the health and safety of others.. and understand the difference between human life and a cog in a machine. 

Everybody else knows what the right thing to do is too in these situations.. that’s why the employees there have kept count of the injustices done to them by management over the years and still talk about them to this day. I’m not wrong just because I took the course that logic and compassionate reason should’ve afforded me. 

Being in my late 20s, after making my own adult decision, I’m being put in time out, and literally called a kid. Am I the only one with eyes open, or what? 

Work to live.. and within reason. Don’t live to work. Be mindful. Don’t dull yourself down to somebody else’s level.. keep looking for what best fits you.. and speak up for yourself when needed.",1644254455.0

A little context, my place of work is a novelty store mixed smoke shop and is quite popular in my area, there’s a lot of other locations in my state and it’s only getting bigger. The CEO, and the managers all love telling their employees that they should treat this job as a career and the usual capitalistic BS that all retail pushes on their employees, even though we make $10 per hour. There is technically commission, which they call our “bonus”, which, I asked what the rate was to which my boss literally said “it’s a percentage”. Which I figured out is about 1.5% sales, for employees only, bosses make way higher. They even limit us, sales don’t go under our name unless it’s about less than $30, and they monitor you and will even send you home if you don’t follow it.

Anyway, a coworker had progressively became extremely ill throughout the shift, to the point where none of us felt comfortable with her driving herself home, as she was violently shaking and throwing up every few minutes - we had about a half hour before closing up shop, so we told her clock out and quit working and try to take it easy, we closed up shop early to help her out. She was adamant that she wanted to go to her dad’s place so he could take care of her because she was horrified of any ambulance or hospital bills. For context, she’s a single mother who barely makes enough for any kind of living with such pitiful pay. Pretty much all of us who work here (asides managers, go figure) barely break even every month, despite all of here working about six days a week because there’s about 4 of us who work here, meanwhile our managers sit quite comfortably. 

Anyway, we drive her home and she gets in safely. Fast forward to today, my boss inquired about what happened and I told him the situation, and his first response is, “Why was she still on the clock? She is wasting sales and company time and money, that had to have crossed your mind right?” 

Not once did he ask if she was okay or if she was safe. 

I said back to him, “I mean no, she wasn’t feeling okay, I don’t really care about company time or money when someone is not doing well, or in general for that matter.”Mans just repeated what he said and I just walked away from him to cool off. She was even clocked out no less and still was going on about it, like what the hell is wrong with you dude!?

Not two weeks in and we have a blizzard roll through Ohio. I'm in the process of improving remote work capabilities and get things real easy through new software. Well recieved by a few testers. 

Thursday/Friday roll around and I ask to work remote and get an absolute no. Either in office or take sick time. Apparently legal in Ohio which in of itself is odd. Not only do I get this notice. An email goes out to a few departments detailing much of the same. Friday middle of the day, a policy update to ""catastrophic business interruptions"" gets added as well to again say no to remote work. 

I came back to hope and the wind has immediately left my sails. Forced to come in for substantially less than what a normal project manager makes. Use a bunch of websites that could be accessed from most anywhere (remote). I have a good friend here which stops me from immediately beginning the search again but man... 

The part that really hits is not because the general consensus is remote work sucks. It's the CEO who can't get it through her head how the world works in the current year. So now I'm unhappy with work once again, probably forever being realistic. Trying to piece together side work but hard to have any motivation in free time when it's 8 hours of mindlessly staring at screens and already not being appreciated.

 I don't want to grind. I don't want to be rich. I just want to be able to control my damn life. How does one continue on? I'm already near the same mindset I'd come home with every day at the last job. I'm not nice to be around because I'm so irritable. None of this makes sense.

smv5fe,Is this even legal?? Company requires employees to pay for client expenses (Reimbursed),9,0.74,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smv5fe/is_this_even_legal_company_requires_employees_to/,12,"I’m starting to feel like my company sees us as banks.

I work in technology, in a company with dozens of clients. Whenever a client asks to purchase something through our company - the employees are expected to pay, then expense the cost later

However -

the expense system is so limited, most of the time it blocks us from expensing the full cost of an item, which can delay us being reimbursed for 1-2 pay checks

These expenses can get pretty high - upper hundreds, lower thousands. I definitely do not get paid enough for that, and I know I get paid more than my average coworker

Their reasoning? They just don’t like company cards, and don’t want to deal with them (????)

When I say no, I get told to ask around the team to see who can - causes some of the most awkward conversations I’ve ever been in

How can this be legal?? Does anyone else’s company do this? Can I just live in the woods?",1644253564.0

It's really frustrating that employers/organizations have not reviewed their old-fashioned hiring processes.

I am a Sales Executive  with more than 10 years in Inside Sales & Accounts Management. Recently I have been applying for some positions in reputable US IT organisations. I joined the Great Resignation from the last year and I thought that the HR attitude towards experienced employees will change with the difficulties in finding the right talents this period....Yet, the same ""B******t"" of a long hiring process with at least three interviews, each session with a decision maker. A very complex and tiring hiring process...I found my self under the obligation to withdraw my own application when one employer asked for a third interview. I don't know if it is the right decision...But I still see no respect for jobseekers, applicants, and potential candidates.

I see how shitty the working conditions are out there. I have many friends who work shitty jobs and I hear about your struggles. However, I’d like to talk about this worker division that still occurs between the traditional labels of ‘white and blue collar’ workers.

I work for a large company that has thousands of employees and the cultural division disgusts me. The ‘blue collar’ workers who work on the floor, clean the building, work in retail, deal with food, etc, have an ingrained hatred for us white collar workers who are up in the offices dealing with engineering, management, design, and IT. It is toxic and it's existed in every big company I’ve worked for. I don’t understand this. We’re all working for the same corporation. We are all putting in the same daily grind. Yes… the wages and salaries are different and the type of work is different, but ultimately we are all trading hours of our lives for compensation. We’re all viewed as numbers by the company. Do you think my CEO thinks any differently of me, a computer engineer, compared to one of our janitors or someone serving food? No! We are just the ‘cost of doing business’ in their eyes.

So why all the distrust and hatred between us? Is it literally just because of money? I’ve asked a few guys on the floor and they’ve said I wouldn’t understand. They have pointed to me owning multiple houses and having investments and hobby cars, boats etc. etc. Is it that simple? Is it literally a material/possession jealousy thing? It can't be. While most office staff do indeed make more than floor workers, it isn't always so. Some of the highly skilled tradesmen on the floor make just as much money, so I don’t think it’s just income related… Is it a legacy from the old ‘union vs management' days?’ Are office workers just lumped in with management for historical reasons?

I know this ‘movement’ is largely labour driven, but I still feel strongly that all workers need to be united. We are all just cogs in the machine that generates billions of wealth for the elites. We need to recognize that there isn’t much difference between someone making $50,000 a year and $150,000 a year. We’re all the same to them. 

So I’m asking anyone here who identifies with the traditionally labelled  “working class” side of things. What’s your opinion on this? Why is there still this old-school division?",1644250455.0

I was a night shift stock  associate for a big grocery store. And last night was a dark night, meaning that instead of stocking the shelves we were blocking the shelves. Blocking means to pull things forward on the shelf. Well, it's usually 4 of us who are there. Two people (the managers) are doing repack (putting things onto the shelf that once couldn't be put up) and two people are blocking. The other person who blocks with me quit his job two weeks ago. So what's supposed to happen is that the assistant manager would come help me with blocking while the manager does repack. However, I got put to block the entire store by myself for two weeks in a row. I did this all by myself, I didn't take any breaks either and my managers got upset and angry at me for not working hard enough. By not working hard enough they mean this: I apparently wasn't blocking correctly (even though I was and also if I wasn't then why did they let me do the entire store by myself and also why did they put me in this position to do this for months now if I didn't do it correctly), I apparently didn't do the entire store according to them (even though I did all the aisles from 1-13 which is what we NORMALLY DO), and apparently I was trying to leave early without permission (even though whenever I finished working I walked up to them and asked if I could leave. And ""early"" btw is at the end of my shift, they were just upset I didn't come help do the work that they were supposed to do. But anyway, they brought me into the office at the end and sat me down and told me that I just wasn't performing correctly then they wrote me up and told me to do better. Then they told me that I should consider this a warning that if I don't then they'll find someone new.

So I looked them in the eyes, went and wrote up my two week notice, left it on the front desk and left. For weeks now I've been dealing with their bullying and abuse in the workplace. For weeks now I've been told that I'm not good enough and that they can just replace me. I was sick and tired of it.

Posted stories from companies that say ""we are a family"" often are the worst places and employees in such companies will not budge an inch. An after hours phone call? Hell no! Stay an unpaid extra hour? Drop dead! 

On the other side of the spectrum. Employees who feel (not told) they are part of something will bend over backwards for their boss. This is mostly coming from people who are happy with their managers, who make them feel valued. I'm a software developer and my current boss is a great person. We often bet coffees on frivolous issues. If he calls me at 9pm I will answer him as I know he would have exhausted any other option before contacting me and it is something serious. 

I say this because I used to think that if you don't put a lot of extra work in my field you wont get anywhere and anyone that didn't was simply lazy. But is because in my case, I am one of the lucky ones. I've always worked with bosses that are amazing and I am speechless every day at the audacity of some of the request they ask of you.

I work for a local government agency in the US. We have a union.

 Last week we just found out a new statute/policy was going into full enforcement. It basically states that no employee can vent, talk down about or complain about their working conditions, supervisors, or the city in any way, regardless if whether they are on the clock or not. 

Say if I was at home, on my day off, and I go onto  Facebook and complain (never done that but I know some folks that do) about my employer not approving sick leave or vacation time and my boss, or someone that also works for my employer see that, all they have to do is file a complaint to HR and boom, investigation time. 

The union has fought this thing tooth and nail. What was going to be a fireable offense is now a suspension and write up. 

This goes for venting or complaining to other coworkers or really, anyone in general. A coworker can simply file a complaint against you simply because they were having a bad day. BAMM! You will immediately be under investigation. 

It's not enough that it's so hard to find workers and keep them, now my employer is actively seeking to punish those that remain, for simply venting about something at work. 

This just shows you how employment laws in the US only protects employers and are actively against the employees.

Edit. I'll be deleting this post soon as it could get me into trouble. Believe it or not, this post would be a prime example of inciting an investigation.

Edit: wow. This post has gotten a ton of traction and decided to leave it up. I also wanted to post a sorta update.

smqcky,I need help leaving my job,4,0.65,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smqcky/i_need_help_leaving_my_job/,16,"So I’ve been at this job for about six months now. At first, everything seemed fine. I actually really enjoyed working at this place initially, as it was a change of pace from other jobs I’ve had. However, the longer I’ve been working here, the more red flags have been popping up and now it’s gotten to the point where being at work causes so much mental strain.

First off, the longer I’ve been here, the more responsibilities have been thrown on me and I’ve been denied raises. I was hired to be a receiver but my boss noticed that I was getting stuff done quickly and so I was thrown in another area of the warehouse and taught new jobs. I didn’t mind doing this and I wouldn’t be so upset by it now if I had gotten any additional compensation for my work. A couple months in I asked my boss if I could get a raise because of how hard I was working and she said that management would laugh in her face. In November, the CEO of the company said everyone would get a raise and that it would be “decent”. Well, I never got anything.

Next, there have been a couple older men who have made me extremely uncomfortable. One of them was dealt with by my boss, thankfully, but the other man has continued to be creepy. He’ll come up to me and call me “beautiful” and “fine” and he’ll always give me hugs and once even touched my face. I have really bad anxiety so it’s hard for me to speak up. I just freeze whenever he comes near me and touches me and hope that he leaves. It’s gotten to the point where I have to be on my guard and make sure that neither of these men are coming over to me area. It’s also made me uncomfortable to go to the restroom, since I will pass by both of their workspaces.

I just feel like I work so hard and no one acknowledges me, instead I get yelled at or people get annoyed at me for doing the smallest things. I always help my coworker in shipping to get everything shipped out at the end of the month (trust me it gets crazy) which helps the company out immensely but no one seems to care or notice how much work I’m putting in. I put in a lot of effort with anything I do in this job but at this point it doesn’t seem worth it. I put a stock label on top of a sticker that had a bit of info on it by accident and someone in the labs  screamed at me for it even though he could easily peel off the stock label. 

Last week there was a pretty bad ice storm and I had texted my boss (she was working from home) halfway through the day if I told leave early because the weather was making me nervous and she left me on read. I ended up staying my whole shift because I thought if I left I would get in trouble and ended up driving home in really dangerous conditions.

My partner says I should put in my two weeks and I agree with her but for some reason I can’t help feeling bad if I do. They’re already short-staffed and there are some coworkers that are actually decent people. I just don’t know what to do. All I do know is that being at work makes me incredibly anxious and uncomfortable. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that I don’t have a new job lined up and I have insurance through my job, so that would be an issue. However, I am studying for certifications to get into the IT field so being out of work would give me more time to study for those and hopefully get a better job.",1644240793.0

We all wear masks, sanitize everything multiple times a day, etc. but with the omicron variant, it was a total shitshow

Around 6 teachers out of 35 got sick and were out for at least a week, and it just went around and around. in total over half of us got sick. 

And we didn't close one time.

We had kids who were exposed quarantine too, but we never closed the daycare. We just had the kids ""stay separate"" lol. now that it's gone through all of the staff, it's going through the kids. and now most of the exposed kids aren't even quarantining anymore. 

we don't do temperature checks before the kids enter the classrooms anymore. I didn't even get notified that the other teachers had COVID, I just heard it from word of mouth from the other teachers themselves. I don't even know when the kids have COVID, it seems like a weird hush hush situation? and it's hard because if I'm exposed, I'm putting my loved ones in danger, but they don't tell me until after I'm at work the next day that I've been exposed, and I have to cancel all my plans to make sure everyone is safe. 

it's just so frustrating because I care about these kids and their families, but I feel so left in the dark about covid here. illness gets spread around here like crazy already, but COVID is a whole other thing. i feel a little crazy for being so worried sometimes",1644240774.0

smq2xx,Job fired me unfairly again..,8,0.8,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smq2xx/job_fired_me_unfairly_again/,17,"I’ve ran out of options as no one in my personal life can seem to give me appropriate advice. I work as a server at Pincher’s Crab Shack on Fort Myers Beach, FL. I’ve only been there a month and have excelled in the workplace. A manager by the name of Bre has told me many times she’s impressed with my work, the servers as well, hell after one month and I already have regulars. I know I’m great at my job period. This being said a couple nights ago I ran into an issue with a couple I was serving. Long story short a manager by the name of Bruce spoke to the couple and doing what a manager does proceeded to grant everything they wished for, including a new server. Which was okay with me as these things happen so I didn’t disagree, I did inquire about my section though, and if I would have a table to replace the one that’s being taken. We’ve had a slow couple nights and having sections didn’t help much either, we usually rotate. So losing a table was important to me as I just needed to make money. He proceeded to tell me this was my punishment for having argued with them, that’s when I cut Bruce off and told him respectfully that he wasn’t here for the complete story, and he shouldn’t assume and punish me because a customer said so, he told me whether they are wrong or right he’s not going to give me my table. I saw no winning on my end that night so I sucked it up and went on. I worked as usual and had no further issues. Upon coming in the next day for my new shift (yesterday morning.) I see Bruce, he greets me and I go on about my day. I work as usual, nothing happens. It’s when I clock out for my shift that night at 9 that Bre, and another manager by the name of Taylor pull me into the office to tell me I am fired. Because “we don’t see you as a good fit” this being a complete shock I ask how? And why? When did this come to be? Because as of the day before yesterday I was impressing each and every one of them. Their words and not mine. Bre being behind Taylor didn’t say anything, didn’t look at me at all. Taylor having been the one saying everything couldn’t even answer my questions. He continued to repeat that “there are others above him,” and “this is the decision that they have made.” I asked if I could talk to somebody to get my job back who would it be? Taylor gave me a backhanded response I couldn’t even focus on because Bre was mouthing behind him to me “speak to Ron” our general manager. After seeing this attempt to help me in this situation I thought it was best to pull Bre to the side so I could talk to her, and that’s what I did. We walked to my car and she basically explained that it was Bruce that had went to Wade ( the department manager and Bruce’s best friend since high school) to tell him of the incident, not only did he tell him that, he proceeded to tell him lies that I didn’t get along with my peers, and that I have issues with several customers.. and the managers can’t seem to like me. That’s where this video recorded comes to play. Upon further speaking to this manager Bre she let me know that this wasn’t the first time this has happened with Bruce. As he is very power hungry and if you do something wrong to him once it could put your job on the line. I ask her how this is allowed to which she just shrugged her shoulders, she at a loss of words as much as I am. Bre recommended the best thing for me to do in order to keep my job was to speak to Ron. And tell him everything she’s told me, and that if needed he may speak to her in which Bre would just have my back. But I ask for help from you guys, and I ask it here because I know of the resources people can have. My question is how do i properly fight this unfairness? If Ron can’t help me get my job back how can I help myself? With this video, and support how can I ensure Bruce won’t do this again? Who is above the department manager that I can speak to? And if Bruce and the DM are best friends how can I ensure that Bruce will stop using this advantage as his weapon of defense. According to not one, not two, but three other girls Bruce has tried the same with them. If they don’t accept his advances he is angry. The only reason he wasn’t able to get rid of them is because they’ve worked there for so long. I, only 1 month. So I fell into this unfortunate trap but I refuse to let this one be. It is too unfair for me to stay quiet, but what do I say with the voice I have is all. Please be nice. I’m open to everything. Thank you. And hope to hear some things soon.",1644240003.0

And I work at a grocery store, it's not like I'm some life-saving surgeon, the worst outcome of not going to work, even if it was one of my work days is that some old lady doesn't get her chicken parm meal.

And yet here I am, already kinda feeling guilty for laying in bed. On my day off. Any tips for changing my mindset?",1644236251.0

smmxlp,Why is overworking employees/ourselves such an accepted thing that's hard to say no to?,34,0.95,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smmxlp/why_is_overworking_employeesourselves_such_an/,19,"Genuinely, I really wonder it. I hate it. I hate the amount of hours I'm working and the stress I'm experiencing due to everything I need to do. I've been pushing my breaks as short as I can just to have time to do everything assigned to me. I don't make any plans during the week anymore because I just know it won't happen. I've had plenty of plans that fell through due to working overtime. 

The team I work in has a severe under-staffing issue. It's not due to the pay. To be honest, it's a little lower than generally in the field I work in, but there's good side-things that make it worth it. So initially I did wonder why it was such a thing. 

Well- I've gotten the answer. Our team: 2 people are at home with a burn-out, 1 is quitting because they feel it's becoming too much for them. 1 person was let go. They didn't outright state the reason but this person came on around the same time as me (a year ago) and from the start he was very clear that if he'd made his hours, he'd made his hours and the rest would wait for tomorrow. I'm quite sure this was not a coincidence. 

My hours have gotten increasingly out of hand as our team has gotten smaller. I've noticed more and more responsibility being thrown my way, despite on multiple occasions informing the manager that I don't have the experience to take something on yet. He literally is pushing me on something that I literally can't do, not due to experience, but because I don't have the access and no way to personally create/apply for this access. Despite how often I repeat that I can't do something either due to experience, this access or simply having too much he keeps on putting my name to it forcing me to do it anyway. 

When I talk about it at work they keep telling me that I'm doing very good and that I'm doing more than they'd expect of me. Which is just not true. It may be more than they should expect, but every single time I inform of having no time and get assigned to it anyway, it's very clear that no matter what they say, they are expecting it. 

When I speak about it private circles it's not even much better! Well, with friends it's somewhat better, since they at least relate (one friend at home with a burnout,  one who recently started working full-time again after recovering from one, another one who is thinking of dropping out of university because they simply can't afford it without a job but their job keeps them from studying) but even then they seem to think it's normal. With family it's even worse. I'm single, no kids, no pets and no weekly commitments. They just  tell me I shouldn't complain because at least it keeps me busy. I once practically had a fight when I said I'd had a calmer week, that I'd only had a handful of hours of overtime that week. Because ""Was it even worth it calling it overtime?"" and ""the youth is just lazy"". I mean- I did work them. I literally just acknowledged that it was overtime. 

I'm about a year into my job and I already feel like I should look for a different job because I know it'll be a matter of time before I've got a burnout at this pace. But everyone seems to think it's so normal that it just feels impossible to say ""No."" when asked to work yet another evening. One time we were still working past midnight (>6 hours after my workday ends) and I mentioned I really had to wrap it up because my alarm for work would ring in 6 hours. They actually made me feel lazy for calling it of at nearly 1! Why is it such a damn ingrained thing to work overtime? I hate it.",1644229252.0

smmhis,How do I protect myself after setting boundaries with my supervisor who makes false reports about me and that conversation?,3,0.59,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smmhis/how_do_i_protect_myself_after_setting_boundaries/,5,"Hi, I’m (21F) a food service worker for a very popular chain for about the last 6-7 months and I’ve been having issues with my supervisor (25M, let’s call him Nate) for some time now. To give some context when I first started with the company it was actually really enjoyable for the first two months. I was getting along great with my team and I was actually looking forward to working my shifts. After those two months, here enters Nate. I was told that he’d recently been promoted to the supervisor position and will be transitioning back into the company after having taken some time off for mental health reasons. I was like cool okay that won’t be a problem. I thought we’d just slowly get to know each other and how the other works.

At first, he seemed really great and friendly, however, as soon as my SM left, his entire demeanor changed. He was very aggressive with his statements and came around like clockwork to critique something I was doing or coming up behind me to speak closely in my ear about how I wasn’t listening to him and that he’d write me up for being insubordinate when in reality I was just trying to keep focus and not let him mess up my flow. It even went as far as him jokingly saying that I must be miserable because I wasn’t smiling and I needed to brighten up. And the part that pissed me off the most is that he does all this shit while whichever other server on the floor is well out of earshot. I was obviously extremely uncomfortable and I’m not sure how I’m supposed to be all chipper when I have this person I literally JUST met coming for my neck and being passive-aggressive and weird toward me. I’m looking at my coworker for help but he’s turning a blind eye because it turns out, they have been in the company for the same amount of time and are *literally* the bestest of friends!! I ended up writing a lengthy email to my manager that same night explaining the blatant harassment and power trip that this guy was having. It goes to HR, she tries to mediate the situation and I was basically stuck working with him despite this entire situation and the ongoing power trip that this dude was experiencing. 

Being the person that I am and the fact that I like the job and the benefits, I tried my best to get along with Nate for the following month. I had to set whatever discomfort I have aside because I can’t miss any of my shifts and we were getting along fine despite the fact I did not and still do not trust him at all or even feel like he's fit to be in the role that he's in. Typically a regular shift at my job is a supervisor and two servers so most of the time I spent laying low with whichever coworker was there and working with them and making an extra effort not to mind anything that Nate did. However, it is so fucking hard to ignore that he has a really bad habit of leaving the floor to spend copious amounts of time in the back either playing on his switch, taking personal phone calls or my personal favorite: just sitting there with a blank look on his face while my coworker and I are swamped with orders. I wanted to tell my SM about it but I kept thinking back to how my previous situation with him didn’t end well so of course I have been keeping quiet and trying my best not to step on any toes which is absolutely exhausting because of the extra workload on the rest of us. 

Then one day the DM appears in the store. Nate’s shitting his pants and makes a beeline for me as I’m walking into the store. He goes “\[DM\] is here. Why is he here?” I obviously know nothing so I shrugged it off. It’s just my luck because as I was chatting with a coworker, he explains to me that someone had reported Nate and the coworker of ours who is his little best friend, and even had video evidence of him and his bestie leaving her alone on the floor for over twenty minutes. Later on, my manager quietly goes around asking me and my fellow coworkers if we have any complaints about any of the supervisors and that it would be confidential and we can go downstairs to write about it. I take the bait, felt weirdly guilty because we were getting along?? but then so much time passed that I ended up forgetting about it. 

Flash forward two weeks, Nate and my SM are having a long meeting downstairs. As I mentioned, I had already forgotten about the letters we’d written and, once again, once my SM is out of the door Nate goes right for the kill. He pops up beside me and in good ol' fashion aggressive Nate manner he says: “So *apparently* I’m not contributing or helping any of you and I would like to know what exactly that means?” My stomach drops. I tell him that I was confused and not sure why he was speaking to me like that. I also express that it makes me uncomfortable and anxious to be approached in such a rude way and that the way he spoke to me just then was the same problem we had back when we first met. All he says in return? “Okay but answer my question.” I once again tell him I am uncomfortable and would rather not have this conversation. He, once again, *demands* that I answer his question. When I continue to say no because I wasn’t comfortable he starts signaling that I follow him to the back and that’s when I finally said: “Absolutely not because I don’t want to go back there where there aren’t any witnesses to the way you speak down to me and single me out about something that has *absolutely nothing* to do with me. If you wanted to have a productive conversation with my coworker and me about this you can wait until we have time to do a huddle but if not I’m sorry but no. I’m going to get back to work.”   
 

The rest of the shift was awkward as hell. He began giving me the cold shoulder and only speaking to my coworker (who had witnessed the entire ordeal and sided with me). He did the same thing the following day and I had asked him for my tips and he just kept ignoring me until I said “Hellooo Nate? I would like my tips please” and he finally looked at me and said “Do me a favor and don’t give me that tone again. I already reported you to \[SM\] about the previous incident so you better watch the way you speak to me.” I was completely dumbfounded but kept my mouth shut because obviously this seems like some sort of retaliation and I refused to say anything else and just waited until he handed me my tips. Later on that night, I get a call from my manager and she tells me about these issues and that he had been texting her live updates about how I was “playing on my phone” and “refusing to do my work” and honestly at this point I am at a loss of what to do because (1) I don’t think I should be penalized for setting this boundary after he tried to press me on the floor and demand answers from me (2) I continued to do my job that day and (3) I don’t think it’s right that he’s trying to gaslight me and manipulate the situation into making me the aggressor and the person who is in the wrong when I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHATEVER PROBLEM HE HAS GOING ON.

Now I’m not sure what to do because I have to close with him twice a week which leaves us alone in the store for about an hour and I don’t want him to manipulate anything or make it seem like I did something toward him within that window of time when there aren’t any other people in the store with us. 

**TLDR:** My (21F) supervisor (25M) and I had a previous HR case because he had been intimidating me and harassing me. Nothing was done about it other than a short meeting with my manager to hash it out and I continued to work and brush his problems under the rug. Sometime later someone else reported him, people who knew of the problem (him staying in the back for way too long) were asked to write about it. We did and then he came at me demanding answers for what he did wrong and then reported me to my SM after I told him he was being rude, making me uncomfortable and that I refused to go into the back with him because (1) his situation/work has nothing to do with me and (2) I didn’t feel comfortable having that conversation without any witnesses being there. He reported this incident to my SM claiming that I was being insubordinate, yelled at him, and refused to do my job. The following shift he ignored me, gave me the cold shoulder, and made me repeat myself several times to get help from him only for him to basically threaten me with this case he opened up against me. I close with him about twice a week and I’m afraid to spend that extra hour alone with him in the case that he tries to retaliate some more and lie about it and I’m not sure what I should do in this situation.",1644227509.0

He tells me that if I don’t clock in and out then he will not pay me for the day. I proceed to tell him that I have been clocking in and if there is an issue, it has to be with the phone. He insists we go check the phone, and I was happy to. 

We get to the phone and I start punching in the phone number to clock in. My supervisor goes “that’s the wrong number.” Apparently it was a number for a different department to clock in or something. Every time it worked for me. I tell him that is the number I was given a year ago when I was hired and I have continued to use this exact number every time I clocked in for the past year.

If this was an issue, why wasn’t I notified a year ago? Or anytime in between? 

My supervisor was very persistent about how this was still my fault. I can not understand how or why he came to that conclusion and why he was so persistent on blaming me. 

I ended up messaging the bigger manager and explained the situation but he never responded.

It starts young- kids in school being forced to hold their pee and reprimanded for needing to go to the bathroom outside of designated break times.

anyway, i started a new job (food industry) about three weeks ago because it paid more than my old job. it's WAY more stressful because this is the first corporate/fast food style place i've worked and i only worked with smaller businesses before. it was worth it for a while because i enjoyed the people i worked with, but they've all put in their two weeks. i know this means my hours are gonna go up and they'll expect more of me even though i feel like i'm barely getting the hang of things. also everyone who's staying kind of scares me, and they shit talk everyone and cause so much drama. 
i'm gonna be completely honest, it worries me and i don't wanna deal with it. i have half a mind to file my two weeks with everyone else. i can't quit though because i have bills to pay. also i'd feel like an asshole, quitting when everyone else is and after literally less than a month.

smj5r8,The New Gilded Age,25,0.93,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/smj5r8/the_new_gilded_age/,4,"I’ve been a lurker here for the last 8-9 months, only officially joined last week. I don’t have anything specific to bitch about in my own work or life, but I really love this sub and what everyone here stands for. I was reminded of something and thought what the hell, even if nobody reads or cares what I think at least I know where I can share it.

I enjoy history podcasts and informative videos, and a consistent theme in historical narratives today tends to be exploitation of something(s) or someone(s). Narrators say things like, “Wealth inequality was massive back then, although today’s inequality is the largest it’s been in American history…” before continuing their story. It’s commonplace and factual, nothing political about it. But that’s literally the time we’re living in, and the numbers and the history don’t lie.

I was watching a video yesterday where the narrator was telling an anecdote about the Gilded Age. He did this tongue-in-cheek lead-in with a not-so-subtle wink where he asked the audience to imagine a world where a handful of people controlled huge companies that managed all the world’s resources so that all the wealth was concentrated to these “barons,” and the working class was left to slave away for those companies and never amass any of the wealth created by their labor for themselves.

So that’s when I mad the connection, really and truly and deeply, we are in a New Gilded Age. It fucking sucks for most of us, and it has sucked and it’ll likely continue to suck for at least a little bit longer. But if I remember anything about the First Gilded Age, it’s that it ended. And it ended because the working class got fed up. Not wise or educated or empowered, like our textbooks wanted us to believe. And it was bloody and violent and shitty, but things changed. All because communities just like this one were formed.

Anyway, I just wanted to post to say that this community gives me hope. We’re living in a time when it seems we’re usually pretty short on that, so thanks.",1644214735.0

I quit as I had 12 on-going projects, when a normal project manager (PM) has 3-4 maximum. 

I was billing up to 50% (minimum \~35%) of the entire department's monthly invoices, when there were 6 other consultants, and 30 other staff. 

I had been doing this for over 12 months, while being promised that they were about to imminently hire a new consultant PM to help alleviate the huge work load I was under. I was working 10 hours days and some weekends, and still falling behind my workload. Client's were getting irritated, I was hating letting down my clients and I had told my directors 5 months ago that I was considering quitting if nothing changed.

&#x200B;

I was pushed over the edge in December last year when profits were up 3% over budget and yet they still hadn't hired anyone new or even given bonuses to existing staff.

I answered a recruiter's call and followed up with a job interview and ended up securing a new job with a 25% pay rise and a promise of only being given 2 projects.

&#x200B;

My directors were surprised when I resigned 2 weeks ago, however thought they could convince me to stay. They didn't convince me.

&#x200B;

Now, they're guilting the absolute f\*ck out of me to stay onboard for an extra 2 weeks after my contractual notice ends. They can't find any one to start, and we were already short-staffed so there isn't anyone able to take on any of my jobs.   
They've realised that they (the 2 directors, who own \~40% of the company between them), will need to personally step up and run these projects until they find someone.

I don't want to stay the extra 2 weeks, but one of my directors called me up today and begged me to stay on later. He said quote:

""I want to see my children. If you leave, I'm going to have to do 12-14 hr working days and weekends and this is because you're leaving. I'm begging you to be a good man and stay longer.""

&#x200B;

I said I didn't want to, but agreed to think on it before I say no. 

I work in a small industry. I want to keep my relationship intact with them and not burn any bridges.

We already produce enough food and houses for ever one in our country to eat and have a house. When the government funnels people into highly technical jobs, it does two things: it increases the amount of student loan debt they are being payed interest on, (good for the government, bad for the population), and it decreases the TOTAL number of jobs, since the amount of money remains the same, but more people are being payed more. This means that less people have the means to fight back, since they’re too worried about what they’re going to eat tomorrow, and where their sick child is going to be sheltered. (Good for the government, bad for the population.)

The government and the upper class depend on the interest from the loans that people who earn a poverty wage REQUIRE to stay afloat. If everyone made a living wage, debt would go down, and their interest payments would stagnate. They would only be able to afford a moderate luxury, two week vacation a year. HOW HORRIFYING!

Everything seemed great but about week two into the job they complained he’s not ramping up quickly enough and that he always seemed distracted even though he wasn’t. The role required him to sit at a desk on the computer for 8 hours a day. He told them he needs 5 minute breaks periodically due to his ADHD and they basically took it has laziness. They asked him to work 10 hour days in order to complete his work for this start up which he was stressed about. I feel like he was lied to during the interviews ( I heard them because he interviewed via zoom). They expected him to learn everything in two weeks and didn’t even give him any warnings before deciding to let him go stating he’s a good person but just not quick enough.

How is it okay for companies just to fire people so quickly? These are peoples lives companies are playing with and it’s so frustrating because he was completely transparent in his interviews they were super excited about him even the VP was excited.

Just a quick beginning. 
I’d like to start by apologising.
This is kind of a long post.

As a result of this post being so long, I will say the main points of what I have to say at the beginning.

Here it goes.

**1)someone living in the UK, working full time (40 hours a week), on minimum wage…. Can’t afford to live a life. (And yes, this is on the new and improved, ‘vamped up’ £9.50 an hour minimum/ living wage, which will be in place as of April 2022). 
(Also, this is in a scenario where they have a paid 5.6 week annual leave).**

(By the way, Whilst I said the worker can’t live a life…I must admit, At the end of the calculations, the worker WOULD be left with some expendable income and therefore would be able to get by… **however**, I am being really tight with the money in these calculations, (I.e. £50 a week on the weekly shop). 
It’s also worth noting, that even then, the worker would still only be left with about £30 a week to use at their disposal, everything… and I mean *everything* else goes to stuff that are seen to be necessities… for reference, the only entertainment I’ve put into the outgoings is a colour tv license).



**2)If you work the big “40 hours a week” full time from the time you are 17 to the time you are 60 (43 years), and in this time, you commit yourself to sleep only 7 HOURS A DAY, PER DAY (yes, every day), THE ENTIRE TIME…. 44.7% of your life will be taken up by sleep and work! 
(Again, this is with roughly a month off of work a year).**



**3)And finally, this one’s the simplest one, if you sleep 7 hours in a day, and work 8 hours in a day, that day is 62.5% made up of work and sleep.
You have a mere 9 hours to yourself, compared to the whopping 15 hours you spend in work and asleep, and this isn’t taking into account travel and any other errands you need to do.**


I know that a lot of this stuff has been said before, but I did some workings, and it all looks even more miserable on paper.

**And I just wanna say, I’m no mathematician, so please, if you see any errors in this, just let me know** 

*also*, I wanted to add that NONE OF THESE CALCULATIONS take into account the rising energy prices, rising housing prices or the rising… everything prices.

**—————**


Other than all of what came before this…

*Firstly* (they say), I’d like to start by saying I hate work, it’s one of the main reasons that I am… mentally in the place I am in.
I love this subreddit, and I love the community.

So that being said, here are some workings/ explanations for the stuff I said at the beginning of this post.


**————**


Ok, so, let’s start with **number 1.**

£9.50 X 40 = 380 (£380 a week).

380 X 4 = 1,520 (£1,520 a month).

And let’s just say here that you get paid the same amount on your month off as you do when you’re working.

1,520 X 12 = 18,240 (£18,240 a year)

Because this is a basic rate of pay, the government takes 20% of this in tax.

Basic rate = £12,571 to £50,270 = 20%

18,240 - 20% = 14,592 (£14,592 a year).


Then, let’s just say we want a small contribution to our pension of 15%? , as well as the 5% workplace pension that may be in place.

20% of 18,240 = 3,648

14,592 - 3,648 = 10,944 (£10,944 a year)


This means, with tax and pensions deducted, we are left with **£10,944 a year**.


Now, let’s say that you pay £200 rent/ mortgage a month

£200 X 12 = £2,400

£10,944 - £2,400 = £8,544


Then, your weekly shop is £200 a month, electricity is £66 a month, broadband/ internet is £30 month, phone bill is £10 a month, your petrol is £25 a month.
Then, tv license is £159 a year, water is £332.83 a year, council tax is £1,898 a year and covering your car, if you’re lucky enough to have one, comes up to, let’s say £700 (I used my own car info for that one).

This all, including rent/ mortgage, brings your yearly income…. Your expendable income down to:

£1,482.17.

That’s equal to £123.51 a month, or £30.88 a week.
(And remember, you’re only spending £50 a week on your food and any other stuff you need from the shops)


So, let’s say you want to ‘treat yourself’. 
maybe you want to eat out/ order in **ONCE A MONTH** at say, £20.
You’re savings for the month are already down to £103.51.

And let’s say you want to buy the medium tier Netflix subscription.
That’s £9.99.
You’re left with £93.52 for the rest of the month.


Tbh, I’d imagine most people would expect you to save some of that money for an emergency (and would probably accuse you of being irresponsible with your money if you didn’t have enough to, idk, pay for car/ house repairs).


Also, if you’re trying to join the property market, it’s recommended that you pay a 20% deposit on your house before you can buy it.


At £123.21 of disposable income a month, it would take 162.324486648811 (162) months, which is 13.52704055406758 (13 and a half) YEARS to achieve that deposit, and that’s WITHOUT spending a penny of your disposable income.


**————-**


Ok, at this point, maybe people will argue that this isn’t that bad!

You still have some expendable income and you’re getting by.

But let’s put this into perspective.


There are 168 hours in a week, so a 40 hour work week means that work is 23.8095% of your week.
This doesn’t seem AWFUL (to me it’s pretty sickening, but still), however, if you sleep 7 hours a day, **plus** work the 40 hour work week 

7 X 7 = 48 
48 + 40 = 88 
88 is 52371% of 168.

SO, every single week you choose to work **AND** god forbid, sleep (and that’s if you only sleep 7 HOURS A NIGHT) 52.371% of your week is spent either unconscious or working.


SO, we can then put this into an even larger perspective:

Let’s say, you start working at 17 (you won’t make £5.90 from the time you’re 17, so the money will all be different towards the beginning, but that’s besides the point), and you are lucky enough to finish working at 60, you will have worked for 43 years. (And let’s just say you get a month off a year).


There are 376,680 hours in 43 years. 

1 hour of 376,680 is 0.003% of all the hours

So, 40 hours is 0.012% of the 43 years per week, 0.048% per month, 0.528% every 11 months, and 22.704% over the entirety of the 43 years.

**THEN**, if we add in sleep, like I mentioned a little earlier:

If you sleep 7 hours a day, every day of the week (no lie ins…. ever) and work 40 hour weeks; 168,388 of the 376,680 hours in 43 years are taken up by work and sleep.
And that means 44.7032% of the 43 years are taken up by sleep and work.
If you want ANY lie ins, or work any overtime that only goes up.

Almost HALF of your life is taken up by sleep and work, and this isn’t even taking into account that you may never even MAKE IT TO 60, let alone retire then.


(I know this part is based on the living wage, but with all of this being the case, you would end up working 44% of your life, for the ability to live in, a, probably, one room flat, (and if you’re lucky you’ll have some money… just lying around… for a deposit to buy a house), and have £30 a week to use as you please).


**——-**


**Anyways**, I don’t know why I did it this way around, but yeah, I thought I’d leave the smallest point til last.


If you sleep 7 hours a night, and you work 8 hours a day, 62.5% of your day is made up of work and sleep.

…. That’s it, that’s part 3.


**————-**


**Anyways, If you’ve read this far, then, I hope you enjoyed?**
**And again, if any of this seems stupid, or doesn’t make any sense the just let me know, or voice what you’ve gotta say in the comments :)**


**———-**


Also, just as a final bit, I just wanted to add, that roughly, If you follow all of these workings through…. **EVEN IF YOU MAKE £11 AN HOUR**, you’re roughly left with about £166 a month at your disposal.

I don’t know about you, but giving over half of my weeks away to just get by and make a saving of about £166 EVEN ON £11 an hour just doesn’t seem worth it for me.


And again, housing wise:
With £166 of disposable income a month, it would still take you 10.04016064257028 (10) YEARS, without spending a penny on anything else, to be able to afford the DEPOSIT on a house worth £100,000.


**———-**


Anyways, that’s the end.

We started off as a team of 7 & the original team has already gone down to 3 with only one new replacement. When I applied to this job, I gave them quite open availability but agreed to do 3 days a week as I was only looking for a part time role (which I made very clear). Instead, I’ve been given 4 & sometimes 5 days a week as he uses all my free days that I had only presented to him as options. We were told to avoid getting holiday time off during Christmas due to staff shortages (straight up told it would be rejected) & now I’m expected to cover the only ‘official’ full-time employee we have when she goes on vacation. I physically cannot work anymore than I am. This job has taken such a physical toll on me (not to mention mentally because beyond my boss overworking us to death, hes also just an asshole who repeated makes disparaging comments about us). He relies on me because I’m the only one who doesn’t have uni obligations anymore. Am I still not entitled to my days off? Why do I have to be busy doing something else in order for me not to want to take on extra work? It’s not even that I’m not doing anything, he already knows I have other work commitments but clearly doesn’t see this as being important. I could honestly make a whole new post just going over the classist, racist, ignorant comments he’s made to us. 

Anyways, I recently got an interview for a dream role & was told their starting date would be at the beginning of March. Of course nothings been confirmed, but my dilemma is that my notice period is 2 weeks which would normally be fine, but I planned a trip for 6 days during the last week of February. If I do get the new job (praying so badly that I do), would i be a real asshole if I asked my current boss to do my notice period during my holiday time? He would absolutely hate this because we’ve had 2 staff leave us in just a week & I’m the most trained at the job so it would put him under immense pressure. I know for a fact that he would tell me how selfish that is & not professional at all but I honestly don’t think I should feel bad after what I’ve had to put up with. I just don’t know how to face him & not let him talk me into staying any longer. He told my last coworkers who recently left that our notice period is actually ‘ambiguous’ & tried to get them to stay longer. I wouldn’t be able to do that if I get the new job nor do I particularly want to. The only other option I can think of is to ask him to reduce my shifts & I’ll work those for my notice period but even then, he will try to guilt trip me into working more. How do I stand my ground? He’s the type who pretends to not know how disrespectful & cruel he is so i cannot overtly say anything back because I’ve always either stayed quiet or ‘laughed’ it off.

Update: I haven’t handed in my notice yet, but today my boss said he wanted to take out 3 of us original team members for dinner as a thank you for the support. This would usually be a very thoughtful gesture but he’s excluding one og member because she handed her notice last week (even though she will still be working with us when he plans to do this) & justifies this by saying he only wants to thank those of us that have stayed & will continue to stay. To me, this just sounds like a threat or a way to force us to stay for a long period as he’s potentially sensing that we aren’t happy. I got very nervous & stupidly said I was available after our work shift on the designated day & now it’s going to suck even more when I actually hand in my notice soon.",1644196378.0

Probably similar situation to a lot of other people, sick of retail and looking to do something different. 

Looking in the long term to do my own business but in the meantime looking for potential Part Time work if decent enough. 

Got a phone call from an employer looking to employ one of my previous staff who had me down as a reference. Gave her a great reference as she thoroughly deserved and then the employer asked me if I was still employed. Told him my situation and that I'm looking to start my own thing and do something different etc. He asks if I want to meet him for a coffee for a potential job offering. Well what's the harm right? Always interested to see what people have to offer.

We met and it turned out he was the director of the company and we discussed a little bit of the business and how he hasnt been able to get growth in 15 years etc. We agreed I could come on as an Operations Manager and after 2 weeks of analysing his business negotiate a longer ongoing contract and salary.

I finally started there this week. I arrived at 8.20am for an 8.30am start with his current Office Manager. When I arrived none of the 3 people in the office approached or introduced themselves to me. Once I approached one of them he told me where my desk was and also asked to make sure I hadn't parked in the Office Managers Car spot....

Sit down at my desk, and patiently wait for the manager to arrive. He arrives at 8.45am and proceeds to tell me that because the director wasn't there that day I would be just observing. Tells me I should start by answering the phones. I've had no orientation or introduction to the people, the office, the products we sell or even to the apparent warehouse out the back. Where everyone drives the forklift if they require them to do so....even without a forklift licence apparently....

Manager then sits at his desk across the room from my desk and proceeds to yell across to me the history of the company and his advice on how to do well in business. Between us is one of the Admins at her desk who is trying speak on the phone with a customer the entire time he's doing this.

I'm then left to familiarise myself with software and programs I've never used before. During this time I observe the other staff as they interact and take calls from customers. The previously mentioned Admin answers the phone and goes to put it through to the guy next to me. She yells across to him that they are checking stock. He yells back ""Just tell them we haven't got it"". After her persistence he takes the call and proceeds to put the caller on hold and then bad mouth them loudly to everyone else as they laugh about it. 

She takes another call and proceeds to tell the guy across from me it's for him. His response ""No it's not it's for *insert Manager name*.""  She tells him they've asked for you and he says ""I don't care put it through to the Manager"". The manager is sitting at his desk adjacent to this guy and just lets out a big huff and answers the phone call without a word.

Another very friendly coworker comes and introduces herself  and starts taking me through one of the aspects of the business. While she's explaining some processes to me I get a bit confused as this wasn't the role that was offered to me. I asked her if this what the Operations Manager usually takes care of and she looked at me confused. She then proceeded to tell me that I was going to be working in an Admin/Sales role and that we had to push on as there was a lot to learn.

I apologised for wasting her time and told her that I'd be heading off as there has obviously been a lot of confusion about why I was there. I went to the office Manager and explained I was leaving and why....he didn't seemed shocked at all.... he just said ok and went back to his desk.

On my way out the Sales guy at the desk next to me said he'd walk me out. When we get outside he proceeds to tell me how much he hates working there and how I wasn't the quickest person to have left. Multiple people before hadn't made it past their first lunch break and one person even left after 30 mins.

I'll be speaking to the Director and giving him the very honest feedback as to why his business has seen no growth for 15 years...",1644195816.0

I didn’t need explaining that these companies are severely underpay for garment construction, but the article did point out that ultimately it is the consumer creating demand for stuff this cheap.

It got me thinking… now, of course the corporations are the ones directly exploiting their labor - but I wonder to what extent consumerism negates being pro-worker. It’s complicated - those in poverty are unable to invest in quality items and are compelled to purchase cheap things that will need more frequent replacement, hence the demand for industries like fast fashion - but I don’t see how someone can call themselves pro-worker and cycle through hundreds of these pieces every year.

If the formatting is weird it's because i am typing kn my phone. 
I recently have been looking for a job in my field in other countries since living in Iran isn't exactly a pleasant experience.
Sad thing is that i am not looking for much! I don't expect a high salary crazy benefits etc. Since my living situation is so bad even enduring work abuse in another country seems pleasant to me which goes against everything this sub stands for. I just want a work permit to be somewhere else legally and be a part of their society.
To tell you a bit about my background:
I have a BA in translation, MA in language teaching, and my dissertation focuses on corpus linguistics (i compiled 23 million words) . I have a CELTA certificate and got 8 on my IELTS exam. I also have 8 years of experience in teaching and 3 years in transition. These might not mean much to you but are more than enough for the jobs, mainly teaching, that I'm looking for. However, in my search for a job i usually come across these: ""Urgent: english teacher needed""
And when i read through the nonsensical story behind why they need a teacher who can start next week blah blah i see this which tickles me the wrong way every time: MUST be native english speaker!
Yeah, native english speaker quilified teachers are dying to come to your economically collapsed country to work for 800-900$ a month by next week.
We dream that one day there wont be a need to work in the way we do now. In the pandemic, when workers, people, teachers... Fuck, everyone is basically dying or are unable to continue their work, no one should jump through hoops to find a bare minimum job just to live.
My situation is awful and a big deal for myself. Yet it breaks my heart when i read the posts of how some of you are treated in your jobs.
I really hope no one has to endure abuse in their jobs...
Maybe if you had time, send some good wishes my way so i can find something as well.",1644193452.0

I do support the r/MayDayStrike and encourage everyone to join that sub and to participate in that.

After that event, I’m wondering, what are everyone’s thoughts of occupying Wall Street/Washington D.C. to demand that the wealthy pay their far share of taxes, student loan relief be granted, higher minimum wage, more affordable housing, a end to corporations abusing their workers, etc?

I believe that it’s important to have a big show of support out on the streets. Ideally protestors in NYC could be reaching out to media to spread our message, seek out donations, recruit more volunteers, and the protesters in D.C. could be lobbying Congress for a workers bill of rights, higher minimum wage, student loan relief, affordable housing, etc.

I have been a pharmacist for 30 years.  I worked for CVS for 18 of those years.  (1993-2011). What should have been “the best days of my youth” if you will. The lack of Human Resources training and enforcement of basic workplace appropriate behavior by management WAS and STILL is appalling.  Honestly, it’s worse than the abuse staff receives from patients.  Patients many times just can’t help it .. they’re ill.. that’s why they come to us.  Yes, it hurts when patients are mean/rude but I always keep in mind that they don’t feel well and many times are 1 step away from being institutionalized. 

While working for CVS I was sexually assaulted by a DM, that same DM accused me of stealing $$ because I was LITERALLY the only RPh processing day 14 RTS correctly when tabs/caps were initially given (I showed him the manual and that’s when he groped and grabbed me, I was told I had to pump when still breastfeeding in the back of the pharmacy (to find out later cameras were there and observed by FSM, I was forced to work with a concussion, forced to work with a cut on my cornea and couldn’t see, told to always make rx count higher by using multiple strengths, to inflate cost on compounds, I was physically assaulted by patients who were arrested and given zero help with safety concerns, etc.   The list goes on and on.

I went in to head up the customer service department... by head up I mean build from scratch. 

They basically employed 50+ temps to answer calls with no training or help whatsoever. 

In my first month I started making waves as I needed to change things in order for the contact centre to run smoothly: new voip system, slack, headsets standard call centre malarkey. I also dropped the temps down to 25 and had split shifts and put on a chat service to ease  the calls... we were getting 5000+.

For this I got sacked by the ceo... on a Friday at 5pm no less. Charming. By Wednesday the next week I had booked a meeting in with the investors of the company and told them what was going on and why the ceo was incompetent. I went with facts and stats. 

I got my job back. 🤪 and the promise they wouldn't let them fail my probation. 😊 in writing. 💁‍♀️

Needless to say this place was an extremely toxic place and full of power hungry egos. The CEO and his best buddie the COO just hired people that flattered their ego and done what they wanted. Instead of challenging them and asking why... 

I'm a why kinda woman... I want to know if it adds value or not basically if its worth my time or my reams time.

My team was my only saving grace but they were forced to come into the office every single day during covid even though I'd ensured they were able to wfh. Then the CEO and COO and HR would wonder why the whole office would contract covid... honestly it was mental. 

I ran a satellite office North London and head office was in SE London. The CEO wanted us all to be under one roof. I was dubious as I knew it would cause conflict for my main team in North. Alas I knew it would save costs.

If you hadn't guessed this was a BIG mistake. We were stuck in a tiny office and my once happy team were silent and weary. No matter how much I tried to boost moral there was no way I could. 

The CEO chose to come in and shout at me in front of all my team one day. I'd been waiting to get a sign off from the COO (remember his best buddie) in order to go ahead with a new system for the complaints side of things (oh yeah I was spear heading that too). Anyway he came in screaming at me to get said system sorted, I explained it was out of my hands and he needed to talk to the COO. To which he responded I'm in charge there's no one more intelligent than me... get it done... 

Well, during the move all the staff at SE site wanted our brand new computers for themselves... which meant us ""lowly"" contact centre staff got second hand computers...

And whose did I end up with... ONLY THE CEO'S.... and guess what... yep... wasn't signed out of his emails... 😏

Not only did I get evidence of him planing to fail my probation due to lack of capabilities in regards to technology (ironic I know lol)... I also got copies of emails of him slandering me, talking ill of my apprence, questioning how I wasn't single and cheating on his missus. 

At this point I realised that I was never going to be left alone to just do my job here. So I took my evidence and done what was needed....

The CEO isn't a CEO anymore just a doctor with a % of the business. Thank the lord. The investors finally stepped in after my sudden ""resignation"" 🤣🤣🤣🤭 and my team have all moved on to bigger and better things...

And me... I've been enjoying some much earnt time off and spending some much earnt money 😏🤭😘💁‍♀️",1644186683.0

On March 9, 2021, 40-year-old Evan Seyfried took his own life due to workplace bullying and mobbing (organizational bullying). He was a 20-year exemplary employee of Kroger in Milford, OH.  His family has filed a suit against Kroger, one of the largest grocers in the US, located in 35 states. 

The Justice for Evan Campaign has garnered media in many states where Kroger or one of its affiliates conducts business. We need to add our voice to their cry for Justice for Evan.  We seek together to garner media attention nationwide as to the issue of workplace bullying and mobbing and promoting DAWA legislation.

We want justice for Evan Seyfried, his family, his friends, and his co-workers on the 1st anniversary of his death from workplace bullying and mobbing.

If anyone is interested in being a team lead for their state, getting involved or want more info:

sm91e5,How I quit working for “the man”,17,0.82,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sm91e5/how_i_quit_working_for_the_man/,2,"This all happened several years ago. I work in the mental health field as a provider. I was working for a mid-sized agency initially hired to develop a specific mental health program that didn’t exist at the agency. We had a lot of success and eventually the company moved me to a management position. I wasn’t upper management though and this is important to note as they were given bonus’ for any new programs. 
I continued to develop the program and even wrote and won a few RFPs in the process. After about 6 years there is began to realize that I was the only person bringing in new revenue to the agency. So I was asked to provide a new service by a colleague at another agency. I decided I’d present it to my boss with the condition that I’ll agree to develop this service provided I get a bonus as well. He declined my offer so I agreed to take the service after hours and began developing my own practice. Two years later I went out fully on my own. While I was a bit apprehensive to go out on my own it was the best decision I have made. 
I’m writing this to encourage anyone who is looking to do this- it can be done- taking control over your own career is very rewarding.",1644185204.0

If you don't live in a place of residence, you don't have the right to own it. Now I know in this country where you could once literally own other fucking humans, that there are a lot of you that won't get this and will tell me at great length in the comments how little you understand what I'm trying to tell you here.

If you live somewhere, that place belongs to you. If you don't live there, it doesn't belong to you. And I get it, even though you don't make any from from charging rent, you're raging at the idea that you're not allowed to charge someone money for existing, fuming that you shouldn't be able to force someone to labor to your own benefit merely for having a basic right. That's how fucked our heads are in this society.

And look at the results the idiots in the comments are arguing for. There are homeless people dying in the cold while 10x more homes than we would need to house them sit EMPTY. What a great way to have abundance!

I'm sure many of you were attracted to this movement as much because of the pressure to make rent every month as the shit way you have to go about doing it. It's the one-two punch of capitalism to hit the poor with absurd costs to exist and insulting wages to make it happen.

Anti-work is anti-rent because people deserve basic human rights, PERIOD.",1644184756.0

Unfortunately 2 days before I’m due to start the new job I get a case of Norovirus from my girlfriend and spent the next 72 hours vomiting and basically living in the bathroom. I emailed my new employer the Sunday night to let her know this and apologised profusely. She emailed me back the following morning and agreed that it was unfortunate and stated she is ‘withdrawing the offer’. Surely that’s not possible as technically as of the morning she emailed me, I’m an employee? Obviously I understand the timing was awful but she wasn’t willing to listen, understand or ask any questions, and ignored my follow up email explaining my situation.

If we had a fund to support them, we could begin to more effectively organize from there.

If there are any that currently exist, I'm not aware of them, and that's a problem. If some do exist, we need to get the word out as much as we can about where they are and how to donate. Or we need to make one. I know I'm not the only beleaguered worker who is in a slightly better financial position than many of my fellow wage slaves who would love to donate to something like that. 

Does anyone know of funds like this that exist? Does anyone know how to set one up? Does anyone know how to signal boost any that are created or already exist? I admit I'm not being the most helpful I can be here, I just have no expertise in this area. Then again, neither does your average person.

I’ve been doing Field Service Engineering for about 8 years if I include my military experience. I signed a non-compete that keeps me from being in the field for one year. 

So, I’ve been unemployed for nearly a year and recently have been job searching but I keep running into the same problems. 

Either your travel is expected to be 75-100% (if I want the salary I desire.) or the travel is more like 10% but it’s  in an office that is nearly an hour or so away 1-way trip.

During the last year I’ve really enjoyed just being home with my family and just being a house husband. 

95% of what I’m qualified for is going to require travel and on-site help out of state or international travel. 

Is it time to just find and work towards another career? 

Or do any of y’all think that I can find something locally that lets me have an office or remote gig? (Location being Denver, CO & salary base pay looking to try and get 80k due to my experience.) 

Or do I just enjoy life without work? 

When we decide to have a family my current residual income won’t cut it, right now it just supports us both. 

But we both want a family so I feel torn. What does this community think? 

Thanks for all your feedback and support, I’m just trying to put feelers out and see how it all goes.",1644183935.0

I started in October of last year and I made $13 an hour starting out and now make $15. My sister is a team leader there and she told me that one of her friends( also a team leader) whose husband works there makes $18 an hour. The wife of the guy told my sister that personally so I have no reason to doubt it’s true. The thing is her husband literally started a month before me. He is making more money per hour than people that have been there for years/ even more than some members of management that have FAR more responsibility and experience 
than he does. So naturally I slowly start to tell others what he is making, choosing carefully who to tell, in the hopes of the unfairness getting around and maybe encouraging raises for everyone in the process. One guy I told in particular was extremely pissed about it and went around telling a lot of people. I overheard that team leaders sat him down and had a discussion with him about it and I don’t know if he mentioned my name or not in the conversation. I go back to work on Tuesday so I guess I’ll find out if management tries to talk to me about it. I think everyone there deserves to make that much an hour and I know that a lot of people that work there struggle on just the $13 an hour to raise their families and afford homes. 

TLDR; Boss is paying new guy $18 an hour while everyone else makes $13-$15, told several people about it, one guy got really upset and got talked to by management, going to see Tuesday whether or not I’m in trouble.",1644183835.0

I wanted to pop in and offer some suggestions I use at my job to keep me sane, hopefully it can help others do the same. 

1. NEVER volunteer for ANYTHING. You’re going to be treated as the go to if you do. Don’t give them that idea

2. NEVER work harder for less money. You owe this company NOTHING, the second you work harder because of lack of coverage, busy times, employees who quit , etc that will be looked at as your operating speed.

3 ALWAYS match your productivity to how much you’re compensated. Didn’t get that raise? Work at 50 percent. Got a raise rhat was less than inflation? Work at 25 percent.

4 ALWAYS use your allotted days off . Those are yours and you won’t get anything for forgoing them.

5 NEVER seek out your boss for anything, involve them as little as possible. Nothing good comes from getting them into whatever’s going on 

6 ALWAYS strive to be in the middle of the pack. Don’t be the slowest and don’t be the fastest. Your goal should always be to fly under the radar

7 ALWAYS find out who your good coworkers are and keep them close. The best way to survive work is to stick together with people you can trust.

8 ALWAYS remember, you work to live you don’t live to work, the second you find a better spot, take it and don’t look back",1644183120.0

This was in a slower period where there was enough time to get everyone properly prepared and trained.

Ive been lucky to be able to get all of my guys and gals promotions and pay raises. Some even 50% just to get them on the same level as everyone else. But hiring was deemed too expensive. 

You guys can guess where I'm going with this. 

Currently going into my 5th week of barely sleeping for 5 hours straight every night to pick up the slack. Currently performing 4 job descriptions and remote logging in from a job site to manage 2 other jobs. I'm running out of options this week as I can't get job critical positions staffed properly. I've been running from job site to job site just to fill in where I could. All across the continent basically. 

I've done all I can for this company at this point. I've grown into the position just to make the lives of my employees easier and be able to generate better working conditions for everyone. At times I've succeeded but it's always been an uphill battle with management. Ive always strived to be the supervisor that I wish I'd had when I was doing the grunt work.

Currently I'm reviewing offers from other companies which have better benefits and better pay and beter working hours. No more phone calls at 1 AM. No more remote ops after working hours. 

I just can't help but feel that I'm letting my guys down in some form or another.

sm5boy,Seeking Advice - Organizing in a Private School,3,0.67,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sm5boy/seeking_advice_organizing_in_a_private_school/,0,"Hello there, 

I work as an Assistant Teacher (AT) at a Private Quaker School. I work part-time and make less than $1,000 per month at my job. There are full-time and part-time Assistant Teachers. The hourly wage works out to about $10.76 after taxes. Meanwhile, there are auxiliary positions that are making $18/hour -- thus, an AT could work in a classroom all day making $10.76, then work in the after school program and make $18/hour. At the same time, administrators created a pandemic position, aka ""runners"" who do whatever is needed throughout the day. They do not work in classrooms and the position does not require the skills that teaching does-- and yet they make almost 2x as much as those of us teaching in classrooms.  This is only one of many major inconsistencies in compensation. We live in a major city where $10.76 is not anywhere near a living wage. We are also not paid any hazard pay.

The Assistant Teacher role was originally occupied by students' SAHMs and thus more of a volunteer role. That is no longer the case; ATs are well-educated and highly-qualified professionals looking to get into education. We add a lot of value to our classrooms and feel extremely underpaid. 

My coworkers and I began organizing a few weeks ago. We feel that we will have a lot of support from Lead teachers when the time comes, but we haven't involved them yet. The administration has refused to increase pay for AT's for many years. 

It is a major concern that the administration is looking for reasons to cut back the Assistant Teacher program. In a meeting with a coworker, an admin divulged that she doesn't think the position is really necessary and they were looking into cutting the number of Assistant Teachers. As of now, every classroom in the Lower School has a Lead and Assistant Teacher. Lead Teachers will tell you how helpful it is to have an AT. Many AT's also lesson plan and lead certain subjects, as well as provide support to the Lead teacher so they are able to take advantage of more planning periods throughout the day rather than supervise students during lunch, snack and recess periods. All to say, AT's provide a ton of support in our learning community and Lead teachers would vouch for that. 

**My question is, how can we go into negotiating better pay, knowing that they are already looking for reasons to cut many of our jobs?** They already don't want to spend the money on the shitty wages we are paid, so much so that they are willing to threaten cutting the program completely. **How do we maneuver this in our negotiations? How can we protect our jobs while also getting better pay?** We had some momentum, but this conversation a coworker had with an administrator has kind of thrown me for a loop. I don't want to not only not receive better pay, but encourage the administration to strip this essential program down to the bare minimum and most likely lose my job for next year. We are organizing for an immediate pay bump, effective ASAP. We have not yet met with admin and are still drafting our proposal for when we do. 

This is a prestigious private school with *incredibly* *expensive* tuition. It's incredibly frustrating being paid below the poverty level while people who make zero contact with students make *bank.* 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1644176099.0
sm5aea,Ramping up the agitprop(DISCUSSION),6,0.75,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sm5aea/ramping_up_the_agitpropdiscussion/,2," 

I have noticed a rise in class awareness and the leftist movement is starting to grow. Grant it we are nowhere near a socialist revolution. But I have seen more and more people actually push back against the talking points that reactionaries love to repeat. That being said I believe that the left especially now would benefit by ramping up the agitprop. The key is not keeping it within the confines of this board or other leftist spaces. We have to infiltrate conservative and neo-liberal spaces and plant seeds of doubt. Don’t give the game away right away, gain trust, appear genuine in your curiosity, cause divisions within their communities, and most importantly have a good grasp of the topic at hand. 

Another way I was thinking of ramping up the agitprop is by the creation of content breakdowns of leftist ideas, tiktoks, essay/videos, articles. I know the left doesn’t get funded like the right does from institutions, but we could make up for it by the overflow of content. Even just commenting, liking, and sharing others leftist content goes a long way. I feel the frustration and hopelessness. This seems more realistic than trying to get people out on the streets, of course that will be necessary if we want to see actual change, but one phase at a time.",1644176005.0

Every job I've ever worked gets worse over time.

Which is to say, nearly any positive is slowly wideled away and any negative seems to grow. More senior co-workers almost always attest to this as well. They'll mention there used to be big Christmas Parties that just stopped. Maybe it turned into a $50 gift card by the time I began the job, but by the time I quit, they even stop doing the gift card.

Every job basically starts either barely staffed or understaffed. Senior employees left will say ""We used to have 6-people in the department, not its 4, which isnt terrible, but its hard to keep up."" By the time I leave a job that 6 which became 4 is now 2. And staff are overworked, or jobs dont get done, which leads to people getting yelled at or mistreated. Small communication issues become big ones. Divide between management and each other, and management and their staff seems to grow. Work atmospheres almost always become toxic and negative and are barely held together by other employees on the lower rungs just doing their best to hold on and pay bills.

I've worked security jobs where they used to be allowed to at least sit down, where by the time I quit, you'd get fired for leaning after they've taken all the chairs away.

I've worked at hotels that used to have a housekeeper clean 10-rooms, but they end up needing to clean 20. Where maintenance used to have to maintain things, but now renovate things with no change in pay.

I've worked residential maintenance jobs where 5000-units that used to have 20+ employees of some regard to help their operation day-to-day is down to 5.

All along the way, raises which were once somewhat regular or at least inflation-catching dry up. Appreciation dissappears. No more ""skip out an hour early cause its a long-weekend Friday.""

Morale is beaten into the grown, work conditions are always made worse.

# 1. Amazon & Apollo, Sitting in a Tree

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxs3igwuf9g81.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae885f68100b3067997c85fb1e5fe312eb81a24

Apollo Global is a hedge fund made of wealthy people and clients that had, at one point, been competing with Amazon in the web server space back in the day. They competed in food too (Whole Foods v. Sprouts/Albertson's) but more recently have been cozy.

Last June, Apollo set up $750 million in money to lend for people who aggregate Amazon’s 3rd-party sellers. **The web server that Apollo bought (Rackspace) also has rumors that Amazon might buy a minority stake in the company. Rackspace, for your reference, is a huge player in Amazon's Web Services, which makes Bezos & co. more money than pretty much anything else Amazon offers, including Prime which it just jacked up prices on.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4enb1xivf9g81.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b035d84db3ba123de69993f34fc8f792619382d

So surprisingly, there’s a shit ton of wine-ing, dining, and 69'ing between these two recently. But this pairing's true heart lies in the backscreen of Amazon's operations. For these two, it was logistics. And that logistics came in the form of an airline tied deeply to Amazon Prime.

# 2. Amazon Air

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/npk3ew3wf9g81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae18e8f5e1c18e575edfa35a96a3e87bb5250ef0

**Between 2019 to 2020, Amazon settled on a partnership deal with airline Sun Country, which is owned by Apollo Global.** Sun Country, which went public last year so that it could trade on the stock market, had to originally delay its IPO due to Covid. Sun Country was a smaller low-cost & cargo regional airline. Most people have never heard of it, but a lot of you might know of at least one link to it. Remember that Braniff airplane at the end credits of old South Park episodes? Fun fact, it was former Braniff airlines staff actually came together to form Sun Country in the 80s.

&#x200B;

[ You kinda see the similarity in the planes ](https://preview.redd.it/iy19fxrwf9g81.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb74ee30fc6b8df3fa481692c0b7bccbf9b4c59b)

**Sun Country teamed up with Amazon to accelerate its air shipping distribution in Amazon Air, as it continued to deliver keep retail competitors on the ropes.** Sun Country would use its 10 Boeing 737s to support Amazon’s package delivery, while Amazon Air continued to expand.

It was in the midst of that expansion that the Treasury Dept. also gave $45 million to Amazon & Apollo’s Sun Country during the pandemic in an emergency aid loan that it eventually paid back a year later. **(And this is all while Apollo Global also benefited from at LEAST 1 other bailout during Covid.)**

&#x200B;

Remember, this was all as that hedge fund, Apollo Global, was betting that malls around America would fail, damning those same jobs\*\*. If it’s bet turned out right, it was positioned to help Amazon speed up its retail overthrow through Amazon Air & Sun Country speeding up its deliveries\*\*. This was while looking at more and more Prime orders, adjusting the logistics ever so much as you might need to send a package from a California warehouse to a Texas one to be able to get it to someone's front door. But I wanna focus here on commercial real estate, so let’s start with where commercial real estate and Amazon mainly collide: fulfillment centers.

# 3. The Network

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phrtm9gyf9g81.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=881e47023b19806277ab73a3b9253401b6818efb

If Amazon Air has become the new airborne mech warrior exoskeleton of Amazon & Prime’s logistic network (courtesy of Apollo and Sun Country), then its fulfillment center network--with its distribution and trucking--has been its spine and nerves.

**Amazon has been BALLS DEEP in expansion across the US countryside, inching across like a retail-killing Akira blob while snapping up commercial real estate at every turn.** For starters: about right now in the US, it’s standing at about 338 fulfillment centers for packing, 666 delivery station networks for distributing, 80 Prime Now hubs, 101 regional sortation centers, alongside its Amazon Air-affiliated 18 airport hubs & 34 inbound cross docks.

Now most US apes are familiar with fulfillment centers either from seeing them from a distance at home or on a drive, or–unfortunately, more often–when things go wrong. **Whether it’s Amazon shuttling down unions outside its gates or keeping its workers from escaping an oncoming tornado at its Edwardsville, IL site (STL6) in a horrendous tragedy and loss of life, knowledge of Amazon’s fulfillment stores have permeated the news cycle in ways that other retailers' distribution networks might not have.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4cpixz1zf9g81.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=d451dfe7b29a02502313a63bef7041955db87cf2

**The biggest takeaway of the fulfillment center network and its growing grid of commercial real estate is that it runs according to this plan:**

* **Most are located** ***near*** **places where people have more money to order from Prime, but built often in poorer neighborhoods**
* **Warehouses are located within a 20 minute drive from a major highway. In some cases, it’s even less than a ONE minute drive from a highway.**
* **With the help of Apollo's Amazon Air, across the entire country the average Amazon truck can get to an airport that can service its deliveries in less than 35 minutes.**

In my research on Apollo's bet against malls, I tried researching history of what Amazon bought out and found 110 properties. Amazon bought out empty land lots, or spaces up for sale such as medical buildings, ranchland, old storage space, or even nursing homes. But whether razing a private school (Opa Locka, FL) or a golf course combo country club (Livermore, NY), or mall (that their friends at Apollo bet against) I wondered what helped them get this real estate.

&#x200B;

# 4. How They’re Fucking Us: Racks on Racks on Racks, No Tax No Tax No Tax

Look, I–as well as most of you–could write a fucking 2000 page book if we wanted on just how bad Bezos and Amazon has been fucking the US and the world if we wanted to, whether unions or pay. And there are 6969696969 more reasons than this one (j**fc I mean another story literally just dropped while I was writing this about child labor/slavery in China for how Amazon makes its Echo devices)**. But I’m here to focus on commercial real estate, and show you just how Bezos liked to fuck us there with no mayo lube for years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/odlfjtb0g9g81.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=8daef5c5a58d3690fc7dea9f9a21c9d202ab9221

**Here’s one of the biggest ways that Bezos and commercial real estate intersect: free money & no tax. And guess how and where that eventual missing tax comes from to balance the books from all that commercial real estate SWAG Amazon gets? People like you.**

**As of 2021, US states and cities have given $4.2 BILLION USD–and counting!--in subsidies (think “free money”) to Amazon.** For Bezos, this rapid fuckery of tax greediness began exactly 10 years ago:

&#x200B;

>**The company’s aggressive behavior seeking tax breaks and subsidy deals took off in 2012**, when it hired a veteran incentives consultant and created an office within its public policy department to specialize in getting “corporate welfare.” **Before 2012, Amazon had not received more than three awards per year; since 2012, it has averaged 19 per year.**

&#x200B;

Saying Amazon “grew” over time puts it lightly, as they've expanded a metric fuck ton. Just how much expansion was it? I**n just TWO YEARS, it went from about 470 warehouses in Dec. 2019 to over 1200 as of last month.** (This effectively doubled how much square footage they cover in the country.) **So it nearly TRIPLED the number of warehouses (fulfillment centers & distribution centers) during the pandemic all while taking advantage of billions of tax subsidies.**

Literally, Jeff should be THANKING YOU AMERICAN TAXPAYERS FOR HELPING PROP UP HIS COMPANY DURING A PANDEMIC: **About 1/10th of those 1200 sites helped Amazon by can kicking Amazon’s property tax, sales tax, income tax, fast-tracked its approvals, and even gave ol’ Jeffrey discounts on the land & commercial real estate he bought up.**

And this was part of the game plan pretty much from Amazon’s day-one transition to 2-day delivery and faster. **In 2012, for example, Amazon would purposely put fulfillment centers in places where it could safely avoid having to give up sales tax in those states. It fiercely resisted this until it could no longer under the huge burst of Prime orders, even running up a tab of $269 million in uncollected taxes in Texas (!)** But once 2017 kicked in, Amazon had to start paying sales tax for orders from states with sales tax. So were they ok with paying? FUCK NO. They quickly sought every opportunity they could.

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Guess where some salvation came? **In a 2017 federal tax credit bill that unleashed lavish gift baskets to Bezos & friends, all thanks to commercial real estate and CMBS shit.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zlb6j4k1g9g81.png?width=2052&format=png&auto=webp&s=3581299eb241280c6097fd8e052a7c5003e341aa

A**mazon located at least 171 (!) of its newest or upcoming warehouses in Opportunity Zones (OZ) throughout the US. They're meant to spur “investment”, are INSTEAD often used to hide capital gains for the rich . When these zones first started, nearly $2.3 trillion by the wealthy was hidden away in them under the cover of “investing in real estate and business projects”.**

**So wealthy can bet against malls and then stash their winnings in these same areas tax-free. And if they reinvest OZ gains back into these zones, guess what?**

* **Your tax rate goes down even more!**
* **You can kick the can on when you pay it too! And the winner?**
* **Any NEW capital gains from those second round of reinvestments are COMPLETELY TAX-FREE!**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckn9o382g9g81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=77676899ea7258dd6e14994b530ca080ed15031f

**So that means as long as your cash gains respawn in one of these zones like a Call of Duty Vantage map at least twice, pretty much no IRS visit at all!** And imagine how much cheaper this is to do and take advantage of during a pandemic, when the price of all this real estate shit the bed?

&#x200B;

>“Amazon has elevated industrial in the eyes of investors…Once the ‘ugly duckling’ of the CRE space, industrial is now the top asset class and draws global investors, not just market specific investors. ...Investors want assets with stable tenants that will grow and produce strong returns. Buildings with tenants such as Amazon…it that bill and are in hot demand.”

How fucked is this? Remember that Illinois tornado? **Well, the state of Illinois ALONE has given nearly fucking $742 MILLION in tax subsidies to Amazon, a company that literally did nothing as it had locked its citizens inside and left them to die. In fact, that state is sooo bad that Illinois’ tax subsidies to Amazon are nearly 1/5th to 1/6th of ALL US state and local gimmes to Amazon.**

The w**arehouse is less than a mile from a highway entrance and 15 minutes from the nearest airport. Nevertheless, Fresno approved up to $30 million in tax rebates and discounts for Amazon. That's 30 years of sales tax revenue plus a 90% property tax abatement lost to one of California’s neediest cities**…**With its insatiable appetite for public subsidies, Amazon is disinvesting communities for short-term profits**,...But because Opportunity Zone investors are mostly secret and undisclosed, we cannot estimate the direct or indirect subsidies to Amazon created via OZs.”\*\*

&#x200B;

**So to add to the fuckery, not only is Amazon grabbing a shit ton of free money in small town to big US federal subsidy tricks, which most of us DIDN’T EVEN KNOW EXISTED, but we don’t even know WHO IN THE WEALTHY FUCK is helping invest in these to get out of capital gains taxes? With all this Amazon owns more land than buildings than any company, second only to Walmart.**

# 5. HQ2: The Greatest Trick That Jeff Bezos Ever Pulled

In my research I found the same year that hedge funds started betting against malls (in a bundle of real estate mortgages called CMBX.6) it was the same year as the hunt for HQ2, Amazon's 2nd headquarters:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t6npf353g9g81.png?width=1690&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f24b2a70b9586fd88eb5d4bcf34d40abce317b

&#x200B;

**In 2017, Amazon poured across all the headlines with a simple statement: “We’re building a new, 2nd headquarters! But sowwy, we don’t know where we wanna put it! Help us figure it out!”**

It dangled the carrot of nearly $5 billion in investment for the winner, up to 50K new jobs in some places. **And 238 cities and regions, under the guise of perhaps–too much faith–fought in a race to the bottom to appease Amazon even further than the 2017 tax credit already was (remember, this tax credit shit was BARELY reported on).** Newark, NJ, home to Amazon subsidiary Audible, offered $7 billion in incentives, while Columbus, Ohio said ol’ Jeffrey could gave 100% absolutely no property tax. Small towns and regions like Milam County (TX) joined hoping “More jobs! Save a dying tax base! Build out our tech hubs!”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1bnraz44g9g81.png?width=1934&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bf13ef41c0cb047a333654623290540bbc17ad8

**Some caught onto the obvious bad effects of this countrywide “wild goose chase”, like a race to the bottom for better and better tax incentives for Amazon**. Places even ""fought"" against each other, like NH insulting Boston:

&#x200B;

>“Choose Boston and next year when you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in 2 hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire. Or ... choose New Hampshire and invest in your high-growth future.”

But eventually, the game stopped as Amazon eventually whittled down a shortlist of candidates, then offered to split its 50K jobs between 2 sites: Long Island City in Queens, NYC and Arlington, VA, home of its actual new HQ2 site (and conveniently, near Bezos’ new mansion in DC). **For its Arlington location, it bought it from another hedge fund Blackstone, and this was signed off by Amazon's secretive shell company Acorn Development LLC.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*

You had some handwashing after the fact of course once all over, some like Philadelphia saying they lost because an Amazon was a NY Giants fan, or shit like this:

&#x200B;

>Also, by all accounts, the HQ2 bid exercise within city government had some helpful internal benefits for bringing together a good team across departments and breaking down silos, which some city employees say has had some lasting positive effects. And the exercise also resulted in a lot of helpful research and marketing materials for the city that can be reused for non-Amazon economic development work.

&#x200B;

Yay? But here is the part that I wanted to focus on. **It’s the part that made me go “oh shit” for a moment while researching all this.**

**And it comes down to one word: data.**

**Where the fuck did the HQ2 data go?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06ofya05g9g81.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c4130bda7d0c4746cbaf4d6fba92f8162c901ea

And yes, of course, I wasn’t obviously the only one to think of this actual underhanded scenario:

>**Amazon gained a huge perk from its HQ2 contest that's worth far more than any tax break…It has also given Amazon something that's potentially far more valuable than any subsidies it may have gleaned: a trove of data.**  
>  
>""**Amazon has a godlike view of what's happening in digital commerce, and now cities have helped give it an inside look at what's happening in terms of land use and development across the US,""** said Stacy Mitchell, a director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a think tank based in Washington, DC. ""**Amazon will put that data to prodigious use in the coming years to expand its empire.""**  
>  
>**Amazon could use this data to aid in future expansion as it selects sites for new stores, warehouses, data centers, fulfillment centers, and other brick-and-mortar needs.In some cases, the bids could help Amazon get a leg up over its competitors, because the data they contain might not be publicly available.**

&#x200B;

>""This is an incredibly valuable trove of data that 238 cities spent time compiling and submitting to Amazon,"" Mitchell said. ""At the end of the day, it may well be that the data is the most valuable thing that Amazon has gotten out of this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With all that was given, it was something that was echoed by many. **It was never about the wild goose chase, but the leverage it could eventually take advantage of in the form of all of this data:**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>""**I think they had this in mind from day one,""** Richard Florida, a University of Toronto urban studies professor who tracked the HQ2 process... **""This was about crowdsourcing data ... This was never about an individual HQ2.""**  
>  
>**Florida called the bidding process a ""game"" that gave Amazon leverage on cities it could use for future business opportunities, even if those cities had little chance of winning the second headquarters**…Indeed, some smaller cities that didn't meet the company's criteria for HQ2, such as a having population of at least 1 million people, submitted bids ...And some cities that made the list of 20 finalists...did not meet requirements like mass transit, **but Amazon still engaged them through the final parts of the process and collected more information.**

&#x200B;

SO it collected data even when it shouldn't something that companies would normally pay firms millions to do all this research, instead for free. And remember, there had been some murmurings that Jeff Bezos (C-E-O en-tre-pre-neur, born in 1964) ALREADY KNEW where he wanted to go pick their new HQ2 spot since it was near his new mansion and his newspaper.

&#x200B;

**If, for example, Bezos ever wanted to pair his exhaustive customer data from Prime or Echo Dot services, he could easily pair that with the shit ton of demographic research that these places gave out, perfectly ready for Bezos to cross-reference and use.**

&#x200B;

Sure, lots of other questions exist about what they hope to do to help support STEM programs at high schools, or racial initiatives. **But in New York City’s case, it gave Bezos 253 pages (!) worth of free fucking data and field research without them lifting a finger. Hell, he had asked some of these cities to tell THEM what the cost of a coffee at Starbucks cost in their area, or how much an avocado or some shit cost at Whole Foods (something fucking Bezos should know if he fucking owns that company), but these cities DID ALL THE RESEARCH FOR HIM.**

&#x200B;

Other proposals are more secret. **In the wake of HQ2 being given to DC, the city's report heavily redacted many parts of what it told Amazon.**

&#x200B;

Planning, zoning, blah blah blah all tied up in a bow for Bezos and Amazon. **For a company trying to expand its logistics monster, strategically picking sites that help give it the biggest tax breaks, sit between wealthier Prime users, it maliciously warp-speeded its expansion protocol under the guise of ""yay you get jobs!""**

&#x200B;

**Remember this was the SAME year that Amazon was already making off like a bandit from using falling real estate prices, malls that were being bet against, and that Opportunity Zone shit. Bezos still wanted more and fucking got it.**

# 7. The Akira Blob

Amazon keeps expanding. T**he Amazon commercial real estate Akira blob looms over the US: of the 10 largest industrial projects this year, EIGHT are Amazon. The total space of just those 8 projects could cover a space the size of Central Park end to end. By the end of 2021, 7% of all commercial real estate sales were from Amazon**:

And so where does that put us? There is a possibility that certain things might exist that we might not see (and I can’t find in my research yet). This could be shit like:

* **We might eventually see how HQ2 data might be used if we track cities like Worcester, MA who both offered up a proposal to host HQ2, then was denied only for a few years later to have its Greendale Mall torn down in preparation for a new Amazon site**. This was all while it dangled a heavy carrot for Amazon, including $500 million in local real estate tax saving.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b23q8boag9g81.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b74c83a5fbf9e5667f2721cca28c5ebd7a396d8

* **As we see how Amazon is weaponizing opportunity zones, like Census Tract 1523.03 in Euclid, Ohio, which we’ll see is one of the first dead malls that Amazon has started to convert to fulfillment centers.**

&#x200B;

* We might continue to see how it works through some investment deals, with other wealthy hedge funds and the rich.

This all happens in the background of false promises from the giant. GoodJobsFirst’s stellar tracker shows how bad these ""job"" promises are:

&#x200B;

>“This…tallies state and local economic development subsidy deals given to Amazon.com, Inc. for its warehouses, data centers, and film productions, and to its subsidiaries…**Since we began collecting and exposing subsidies the company has received, we have encountered greater secrecy surrounding the packages awarded to Amazon. This sometimes makes calculating such costs difficult. Secret project names, non-disclosure agreements, and a reluctance by public officials to fully disclose costs -- even after a deal has been awarded -- suggests Amazon and public officials know these deals have become controversial.”**

So remember this is all happening to these cities, these towns, is unbelievable.

&#x200B;

Under the false promises of expansion, Ohio is one state that unfortunately got to fucking over its own statespeople the most.

**For Amazon’s workers in Ohio, even though its only the 53rd biggest employer in Ohio, nearly 1 in 10 of them are on food stamps. A three data center deal for Amazon in Ohio gave it no taxes for 15 years ($77 million)**. **This is all as one EPI report said that an Amazon fulfillment center does nothing really for local employment, is wholly inefficient for job growth…all it does is replace 1 person working at a local spot for a job at an Amazon warehouse, giving near net-zero gain:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/82e4dtpbg9g81.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=4451dc928e5b0396aaedfb7b64d0351fe1a32ffc

**So adding it a bit altogether, we know that hedge funds like Apollo can not only bet against everyday American’s malls, all while helping Amazon make its money hand over fisting all of us from billions in free tax giveaways, all while using tricks to give itself even more free tax giveaways, and under secret goose chase proposals?**

Many of my coworkers have told me that they have always gotten their days off that they requested, approved. So you can imagine the relief and high hopes this gave me. So I scheduled ONE DAY off a whole month in advance instead of two weeks so I could come off a little bit more responsible. 

Waiting patiently, my request doesn’t get a response until the exact two weeks off just for it to get rejected!?!!!

This threw me off because this guy who rejected my request isn’t even the same person who I’ve been told does the approving and rejecting. The guy who usually does this knows me and know I’ve been working crazy to get just ONE day off. I’ve been picking up hours and working longer shifts to help out! All I asked for was just Friday off since I already get Saturday and Sunday off. My work attendance is phenomenally punctual and my work ethic is genuinely excellent, but apparently that doesn’t matter when I want a little break! 

Luckily, others can pick up shifts for you. I tried to ask a coworker I’m close with and she called me to be rude and say things like: “I don’t ever FEEL alike picking up a shift” “No ones gonna pick up your shift” and say other things to belittle me and in a tone that you would use to talk to a child who wasn’t understanding a concept. Which made me more irritated. But I did find someone to take it for me happily besides her! (This coworker when I said that I wanted to quit literally said “but think about the money” as if that’s more important than my health)

This is why I am very close to quitting because I can’t get one simple day off, it’s was a lot trying to find someone to take at least part of my shift, and a coworker with a rude attitude. At least, I can go on my trip! <3",1644171944.0

Ok, well, part of the reason is because working out with weights takes technique and occurs in a controlled environment.

If you're just lifting boxes all day what you are doing is ruining your lower back, destroying your elbows and knees, and the effort does nothing for your overall health.

Since I didn’t hear anything on the other two jobs I reached out to a recruiter about why I wasn’t considered, especially since one was entry level. The head recruiter set up a meeting. 

She asked why I was looking for other roles within the company, what my past experience has been, what my goals were, and what I really wanted to do in life, explicitly stating that I should do something “you love” and that “money isn’t everything”. 

I mentioned I was unable to pay bills at my current role, and I’m looking for any role within the company that pays more, especially one that has a normal schedule so I could work two jobs again. The upside is this company has amazing heath benefits and 401k (not that anyone can afford to put in enough to get the full match, but I can dream).

She again reiterated how “money isn’t everything” and that I can “work my way up” (taking 5-10 years to effectively make enough money to live in my current role) and to really focus on doing something that “you love”. 

I hate my current role. 

I told my direct boss I’m selling stuff to make ends meet every month and he laughed. Thought it was hilarious. 

Side note: I know other people have it worse. My partner and I have been able to make this work so far by her working (till the kid was born, can’t afford child care if she works), me working two jobs for a while (got promoted to this role and my schedule changed, couldn’t do both jobs anymore), random contest winnings / market research ($250 last year between three things), setting up sports betting apps (Bet $5, win $280, up $400 last month) and selling random stuff (family vehicle last year (bought a beater with 235k miles), flipped a vehicle, pawned coins, random baby stuff, clothes, yard tools, power tools, etc.). Also had savings for a bit last year. 

TL/DR: HR / Recruiter reiterates how “money isn’t everything” after I explain I literally can’t afford to work here in my current role.",1644169860.0

Then without warning my job site boss calls me and asks for me to come in as we had not enough workers show up and he needed people. I asked if this was mandatory, he didn't answer and only got angry and demanded I come in. Pissed and tired of his crap already I drive to work, only to discover that not only were there the maximum four workers there, that they were there for hours.

Today my boss is trying to do the same crap but with different words. He is calling me at eleven in the morning, and is asking I come in at two. When I asked if I'm actually needed or even mandatory, I just says and I quote ""Yes I need you now get here at two and call the main shop boss."" (that is another shops boss and not even mine technically.)

I work from 7 am to 3 pm on a normal Monday through Friday. And typically we only get called in for work on the weekend if it's snowing and the days always start at seven in the morning. And if its voluntary work its only four guys total. I don't know why but something is really fucking fishy. Or I am wayyy off base.

sm26ae,I feel so much relief after quitting,19,0.88,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sm26ae/i_feel_so_much_relief_after_quitting/,3,"Over the summer I got two jobs: one at a farmers market where I make and sell products for an older couple, and one at a popular retail store at a mall. I'd never worked anywhere before then due to Covid and not being able to drive, so I was pretty excited to have some money for myself and jumped in head first. And I finally realized how soul sucking it is to work for corporations. 8.25 is what I started off at at the retail store, but I was paid 25 dollars plus 10% of what I made for my farmers market job; the jobs were as different as could be for jobs both focused on selling things. One was paid by effort and one was paid by attendance. As the summer progressed I was working an average of 35 hours per week, about equal in time dedicated to the two, averaging about 200 per paycheck for my retail job, being paid every 2 weeks. If I did well, that's what I made in a week for my market job. It was hard, but I enjoyed the work. Then came the end of the summer.

As I was a senior now, I had to start worrying about college, so I quit volleyball in order to work, which my retail job was obviously glad about. As the school year started, they kept losing employees, including some long time ones who had moved on to places that made them happier. My market boss, however, was concerned that if this was what I actually wanted. She had raised many children and cared more about if I was happy.

 As the year progressed I became the sole employee at my retail job other than the managers able to work weekdays. They kept asking me to work more and more hours, and even gave me a raise, but due to company policy I was not allowed 10 dollars. Yeah.. [retail company] sure does care as much as their slogan says. I was pushing 40 hours every two weeks, and probably would have worked more if not for the fact I asked them not to schedule me on the days I had markets. Didn't stop them sometimes tho. By the time it was October I hadn't been able to go out with friends for months. But, as the retail company knew, I needed the money. 

Holiday season came and I was pushed to my limits as my family situation was becoming very stressful, but my retail job didn't care. I was the person keeping the store open. If I quit, they didn't have anyone else. They couldn't see how they weren't getting applications. They desperately needed people for the holidays. But since I was already being paid as much as the company allowed I had no bargaining power. All that kept me in the retail job was the promise of a promotion as soon as I turned 18. But my market job kept me sane. It was such a relief working there that I knew if I had to choose between the two I absolutely would never choose the retail job. Despite my managers trying to convince me to quit the job because they said it wasn't paging me enough. Ironic. 

I struggled through the holidays as another sport season had started for me so I had to balance practice on top of work  but made it to my 18th birthday, putting my two weeks in for my retail job. I was so relieved I could have cried. I was excitedly telling the managers my plans for new years, where I was driving two hours away to spend the night at my crushes house. It was one of the things I was looking forward to most during the holidays. My schedule was then posted after going home that day. I was scheduled the entire time the mall was open both new years eve and day. If I was still looking for a reason to quit that would have been my last straw. I managed to get through the two days but I was so exhausted I spent the whole next day in bed. But I was free from my retail job.

It's been a month since I haven't had to work there and I just can't stop thinking about how grateful I am to be gone from there. I've genuinely been able to enjoy myself and take the rest I've needed. I've been able to hang out with friends, some I haven't been able to have a sleep over or eat out after school since summer. My grades are improving, and I haven't been forced to skip practice to work. Small businesses will appreciate and treat you better than any corporation.",1644168369.0
sm26a1,The real reason the government doesn’t want to raise wages is inflation.,0,0.45,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sm26a1/the_real_reason_the_government_doesnt_want_to/,21,"It kind of just hit me but it seems like the major, big picture reason that wages are being capped or there’s pressure to keep them low is inflation. 

Typically, there’s a push and pull between prices and wages with each rising steadily, most commonly at 2% each year, which is considered safe. Prices come up, then wages, then prices, then wages. 

I believe that large institutions and government banks think that they can keep inflation “temporary” if wages never rise to meet it, or at least don’t come all the way up. They want to tamp down the risk of runaway inflation. If wages were to rise rapidly, and people could all of a sudden afford to buy things that are experiencing high prices right now like houses, cars and higher end foods, it would place even more demand on those systems thereby raising prices and creating more inflation. Also all the fixed income that the government doles out is raised based on inflation so even if they have to bring it up by 7% which is supposedly an artificially low number it would require more government spending thereby increasing inflation. 

Apologies if this is like a half-thought. I’m no expert, just an observer and I’d love to hear other thoughts or riffs on this. Also not saying it’s correct, just is what it is. Big government will always take care of big business and the worker will always be the one carrying the brunt of it all.",1644168369.0

(I've only gone in a couple hours to shadow and see what the environment's like, jobs not ""guaranteed"" but might as well be.)

The bummer is that I asked for full time, but am dreading the sudden change from unemployed -> 40 hrs. I haven't spent that much time at work for years. Totally my fault, but admittedly the pay was a huge motivator

Secondly, they'd be really early hours- I was expecting 6am, but was corrected that the department I was hoping for opens at 2. Again, everyone was nice, and all said ""It's a pretty big change, but we've all gotten used to it. It's an adjustment."" Plus, there's still positions available for 6am, though if I wanted to change my mind now is obviously the best time.

I kinda pressured myself into asking for and agreeing to a lot that I feel unprepared to handle. They were pretty up-front about their needs and seemed open to me changing my mind, but now I just don't wanna come across as flakey. I think I'm poisoned by everything I've learned about work ethic from elsewhere.

That's kinda it, I just wanted to see if there's anyone else who's been in similar situations.

Am I doing something wrong internally?

For context, I'm a truck driver. That immediately puts me in ""sits on their ass all day long, but doesn't do anything important"" category. (One person I've talked to legitimately believes that truckers drive massive vehicles for fun/to fuck up the environment/to be in the way of everyone else/for political reasons, and that there wasn't any reason for anyone to drive a semi. No lie, she thought everything moves through Amazon.)
I've had a series of bad months going back to September, where performance has been down pretty badly. Got sick twice (not covid, thank goodness), had my wife (rides along, basically a stay-at-home wife on the road) get sick twice, and had to care for her, and then there's been weather events that have been downgrading my performance. Wind and extreme winter weather can shut me down, and I've had to stop on several occasions due to those types of things.

The end result is that I haven't been making enough miles to pay bills, and I haven’t been making enough miles to justify the company's expenses (truck, insurance, permits, taxes, personnel insurance, personnel taxes, and personnel permits). The company has either lost money with me, or only just broken even.
The kicker on all of this is that I recently told my wife that I wouldn't hire me, due to my performance. A good day according to the metrics is 500miles per 11hr day. I'm making 240miles/day on a ""good"" day for me, and I'm at my wit's end.

I know, we are ""special"" right? No, we are just managed by companies, and they don't want people to celebrate workers' struggles. Others may get ideas, right? 

With some many stupid 'day of this' and 'week of that', there is nothing that celebrates what was done, and reminds people that more can be done.

Considering the level of engineered slavery we have in the US (low pay, a culture of indebtedness, healthcare linked to work, an overgrown and repressive internal security apparatus) it is time to celebrate what really matters, and remind people that change comes from working together, not from staring at your belly button, or Netflix.

Being 'independent' (from each other) is possible the most damaging thing to a Worker's movement. If each one is out the for him/herself, on the Bezos of the world win.",1644163506.0

slz50h,"Working at the Malta Collage of Arts, Science and Technology (Mcast)",4,0.71,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/slz50h/working_at_the_malta_collage_of_arts_science_and/,1," 

Working at Mcast.

Mcast is a collage where students of lower and higher level come to study.

From the Management’s point of view it is portrayed as a perfect heaven but what they don’t tell you is that it is quite the opposite.

As a person working at Mcast, I can tell you things are far from perfect. We have students who have units missing from their courses because no one was assigned to lecture them. Some courses have even up to 3 units and this has been happening from the beginning of the year. We have lecturers who are overloaded with work and who apart from the work load have to put up with lousy online systems for grading and uploading assignments that change each year. This is not only detrimental to the staff but also to students who have to navigate the new system as well each year. Who helps these students you might ask? There are mentors for students from MQF level 1-3 and Deputy Directors from MQF Level 4-6 with the occasional help of Support Service Coordinators.

What does Mcast decide to do with this help? The mentors were originally employed under an EU project with a deadline till the end of 2021. After their contract expired they were given only 7 months extension. Now that their contract is coming to an end, they are told that the collage will only employ 16 mentors for just a year. So, if they want to try to obtain a job for only an additional year they have to reapply with the rest of the public and sit for an interview. How come nothing is done by the government? The mentors are a group of 23 and each mentor looks after a significant number of students. Imagine this team being stretched out to only 16 mentors. They have helped so many students in each institute that they prove to be irreplaceable. I ask myself what will happen to the students when the mentors are gone? All these students will have to be aided by maybe the Deputy Directors who already have quite a lot to do or they end up on their own. This will surely result in a lot of drop outs in the lower levels. Therefore, what will happen with the Student Mentors? Action needs be taken for the Student Mentors to be incorporated with Mcast as permanent staff.

We can also lightly brush on the fact that the collage is not properly equipped. Computer labs with old computers and some that don’t work, salons with malfunctioning equipment and staff without laptops or computers. I know of a particular case of someone who asked for a laptop and was told that there is no other laptop available but they can share the 2 laptops that are available with the rest of the team. Please note that that team is made up of more than 5 people. Imagine having to share a laptop at work with another 2-3 people, so therefore they have to bring their own. This is unspeakable. There is also the ridiculous issue of HDMI cables not being available in classrooms. This results in lecturers having to scram to get them from admin before lessons so they can connect their laptops with the projectors or TVs.

Let us not forget about the Mcast Car Park. This car park which is built under one of the newest buildings has so much leakage in it that when it rains one might mistake it with a pond. There are whole areas which when it rains are closed off with tape so no one parks there due to the water leaking from the roof. Water comes down from a new building which has several issues mainly water coming down from windows and even the ceiling and electric sockets. Leaving the staff to collect water with towels and buckets to catch leaking water.

One may ask so who is responsible of all this? Some can turn to the Principal who you would think will be notified about these things and act on them given his €117,000 a year but that doesn’t happen (in Malta that is a very high salary). There is this sense of fear at Mcast that if you speak up the management will come after you. This was already highlighted in a case where a lecturer won a court case against unfair dismissal from the collage.

The Maltese authorities should really check this out!

This isn't anything new, and it doesn't appear to stop anytime soon, if at all. How come? No matter what improvements the workers see to their conditions, it doesn't take long for them to start fighting for better conditions once again. Or, seen from the other side: When the workers are dissatisfied, the employer might improve the conditions, which will satisfy the workers, but only temporarily. And I don't just mean traditional working class jobs, we see this trend of continually fighting for improved conditions in fields as different as nurses and sports stars.

In short: The workers are dissatisfied with their work, unless the conditions of the work sees continual improvements, which leads me to the conclusion: The workers are ultimately dissatisfied with their work, period. Why might that be?

There are in my opinion two possible explanations as to why: The first possible explanation is simply, that the workers are unreasonable when it comes to their demands. That either because of greed or ignorance, the workers simply refuse to acknowledge that their conditions are good and fair. That argument runs into a problem though: Why are their demands unreasonable? Why are their current conditions reasonable? At what point in history did the workers demands become unreasonable: When they demanded a 40-hour work week? The right to strike? To unionize? For equal pay? Because at the time, the employers and their sympathizers certainly seemed to think so. Were they right? Because we see exactly the same arguments today, why should those arguments be more valid today than before? What has changed?

I think there is a much simpler explanation: The workers aren't, were never, and will never be satisfied with their work, simply because work, as we know it under capitalism, is, by its nature, inherently unfair. If within the system, no matter how much you improve the conditions for the worker, they will never be satisfied, then for the worker, the obvious conclusion is that the problem lies not with the conditions of work, but with the system itself.

Now, regardless of what explanation you think is the most likely, one thing is for certain: That a system, where the workers will demand more and more forever, isn't sustainable. So what is the solution? The idea that telling the workers that they are unreasonable, that they should be grateful for what they have, that they need to accept the ""real world"" is going to solve anything is laughably naive. So to those that believe that the workers are being unreasonable: What do you propose we do? How do we solve this problem?

For those, myself included, that think that the problem in stead lies with the system itself, the only possible solution seems glaringly obvious: To abolish work entirely.  After all: Improving the system will never be satisfactory, so what other possibilities are there? This is why I believe that anybody interested in improving workers rights should be anti-work.",1644157555.0

So recently had been discussing with some friends the Opt-out of Sunday working law, and how it's so.... SO.... unheard of (I wonder why?)

The basic premise is every retail worker I've encountered, every contract & handbook I've ever seen/had has never once mentioned it, it's as simple as giving your notice and you no longer work Sundays once this ends (T&Cs are if it's your only working day ect); 

But how often have the brunt of the work force had to work those god-awful Sundays, whilst all the supervisors & Management enjoy their weekend like others?

slyde6,Got fired for catching COVID,8,0.84,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/slyde6/got_fired_for_catching_covid/,3,"So this all starts about 10 months ago, I was 18 and was looking for my first job and I found a local restaurant I hadn’t heard of before called burger boy, and honestly I loved it, I made some really good friends that I still talk to on a daily basis today, the crew was fun and so was the work.

At some point the GM left maybe 4 months after I started and in his place was the new GM, and he seemed like a nice enough guy, I personally had a decent relationship even before I got fired, but in his first month one of our employees cut open his hand, there was blood dripping everywhere, there was a risk of him passing out. His girlfriend was another one of my coworkers, she happened to be working that day too, when she saw what happened to my coworker, she obviously wanted to drive him to the hospital, the GM’s response to her asking him to do this was “I can’t have that many people leaving at once”.

That was the first straw.

Fast forward a few months and my family goes through a tough time, and I’ll describe  this with detail. 

In the middle of October, my grandfather died, much of my family huddled at the end of his death bed in wait for what we knew was coming, the moment he passed, I took a few minutes with my family, and I felt that I should call the owner of burger boy (the GM’s boss) to let him know I wouldn’t come in for a my two following shifts on Sunday and Tuesday, he completely understood but when I returned for my shift on Wednesday I was pulled into the office by my GM for a talk. The talk was solely about my attendance and the four shifts I had missed, first of which was the result of a bad reaction i had to a plasma donation, I asked the place for a written form of proof of what happened but they told me they didn’t write such notes, the second and third being the days I took off after my grandfather died, and the fourth being a cat crash I was in that totaled my car, he told me that all those absences counted on the point system we had for our attendance, the limit is seven and those 4 “incidents” put me way over the limit at like 13 or something. I told him I was sorry for missing those days but those were all valid reasons to call out, I pointed out that i had been working on my punctuality recently and that I need the hours because my family got put in a tough spot after my grandfathers death as he was a pillar in the family, so I had no reason to lie about why I was calling out. We wrapped up the conversation as I had to get to work but essentially what he said was that if I called in again I would be fired. I struggled with my mental health in the months after my grandfathers death especially the first couple months after so it was really hard fulfilling the 40 hours I would work a week, but I managed it. 

After that incident things were decent because I was able to hold up to all the shifts I was assigned, fast forward a few months and something else happens.

It was the end of January and omicron was starting its peak, so burger boys higher up’s decided to implement new protocol for COVID safety, part of this being stay home for five days after a positive COVID test.

Pretty quickly people started getting sick, an employee first, then two managers, then, I got sick.

At first I just had a sore throat and congestion, so I was okay to work, but with everything happening with my other employees I knew what it was, so I brought it up to my GM, he said okay get tested after your shift, being an employee I had to comply and get to work. 

The next day I had the same symptoms but a bit worse so I brought it up to him again and simply asked me about getting tested, I informed him that with the recent spike in cases it was difficult to get an accurate test quickly. He brushed it off and I had to just get back to working.

The next day I woke up with much worse symptoms including aches chills nausea shortness of breath all the common COVID symptoms. So obviously I called in, the day after I got a positive covid test these symptoms lasted a few days so I called in on that following Wednesday, and the following Thursday, when I called in on that Thursday I did it through text the way many of my coworkers do (I cleared this with a friend before doing it as to make sure I wasn’t going to get a negative reaction from my boss) he told me that I should be calling not texting contradicting what I heard from other employees. He proceeded to ask me my symptoms so I told him I still had the congestion and sore throat that this started with , he then told me that those were symptoms of allergies and that I needed to call the store, so I did and the manger in the kitchen answered even though the GM was there on site, he proceeded to tell me that if I was going to call in I needed to find coverage, I told him I’d try but with everyone sick it probably wasn’t going to work. He then told me that I should be coming in as he was one of the people that had been sick and he was working with symptoms so I could too. We went back and forth (passively) on the phone for a minute and I paused too say this “let me make sure I’m clear on what I’m hearing, you want me to come into work on a day that I got a positive COVID test just because I dont have a fever?”
 He said “ that is precisely what I’m asking you” and I told him no that is not happening, he said goodbye and wrapped up the phone call. It’s been two weeks since I’ve heard from them and they just never put me back on the schedule.

I remember getting my first “real” job. I was 16. I went into my local hardware store and asked if they were hiring. A very nice and genuine young woman assured me that they were and asked if I wanted fill out an application. I said yes and she walked me to the back room so I could sit down while I worked on my application. She sat me down and told me she would get the store manager for me. 

The application was very brief. Name, address, Telephone number, work history- which I didnt have. No survey, no data collecting for “tax purposes“. One page. It definitely was not online and it didn’t demand I use one particular browser or another as an excuse for the web developers shortcomings. 

Needless to say I was hired on the spot. I worked there all the way through high school and I loved it. I was treated fairly and paid a decent wage for the times. I wasn’t allowed to work past certain hours because I was a minor. No managers made ridiculous demands or threats...they were good people. They ran the same kind of high traffic, big box store with the same volume of money coming in and out…And they did it with only very basic computers… And no Internet. 

What happened? More often than not even applying for a basic retail job is an exercise in futility in many cases. We have all been there… Online…frustrated by the application process...no matter the industry. Days or weeks of waiting for, most likely, an email. Possibly an interview with an underwhelming, poorly trained and disinterested member of store management reading a script...Pre-employment drug tests for non safety sensitive jobs. ..blah blah

I've been working at a grocery store for about a month now after not being in retail (or working at all) for like two years because I'm a student. Honestly, this job might not even be worth it, i need the money but i don't need the bullshit.

First of all, the way the store is set up isn't familiar to the people in my country, this particular chain is international while the other common grocery stores are national chains so they are completely different. To keep up with all the sales and temporary stock we have to move shit around all the time so no one, including the staff, can find anything. And who gets shit from customers for that? Me!!! Even though i haven't even been stocking the shelves that day i have to take the heat at the register. 

Just the way we work is so inefficient as well. I know that most of the staff at grocery stores usually have a jack of all trades kinda role, but if we're goin to do tasks that are unrelated to each other, they should at least have some kind of flow to them. 90% of the time, I'm the main register and aside from restocking bags, the register fridges and you know, checking People out and greeting them, I'm also supposed to find time to label the discounted bread from the bakery and label and sort the plants by the entrance. None of those things are even close to my register. And, I'm also not supposed to be too far away from the register. But i also have to be because apparently that's my fucking job. Then i get reprimanded for not doing things quick enough when i KNOw no one else can do this either. I don't even have the little hand computer things i need to label all the things because the people by the fruit section, which is literally next to the flowers, need it first. Why can't they do the flower shit? Why can't todays baker label the fucking bread? 

It's not even like the degree I'm working towards will be that much better either, I'm gonna be a teacher, which had evolved (devolved?) into just another shitty service job.

The best offers are usually something like :""start working for yourself"". But that just means another way of hanging on to the world of individual achievement and social exclusion by private property.

I've been reading David Graeber's books Debt and now more recently the new one, The Dawn of Everything. I really enjoy how he basically (with Dave Wengrow in the new one) smash to pieces the common myths about the  coming of markets, moneyed economy and private property.

I'm not going into much depth here myself, but what realistic visions people have? One is undoubtedly to move outside of the big cities to where the land and property is cheap, and try to eke out some kind of partly self-supported life there.

Pay detail to how I'm not taking about ""self sufficiency"" because that is is another reflection of our individualistic culture, and a very self-defeating at that.

We humans are social beings, and born to support each other. In many past pre-money and debt societies tools, food etc were common and everyone worked together to make sure that everyone got what they needed. So this implies that we need community.

But I've been a hang around in the eco community movement for a few decades, and see it does not offer good solutions. The existing communities tend to attract ultra-individualists and people with problems who hope that the community can heal them. And in practice I think for anyone brought up in our world of private property and hierarchical violence, it is very hard to let go of that.

So where to look for solutions?",1644154172.0

A little back story on me. I worked for the same company for almost 14 years and while I had my ups and downs it wasn’t the worst place to be. I had a job that I liked, I was paid decently, and I enjoyed the work. 

Fast forward to 2020. I hid a deep secret from the world and myself for 30+ years and couldn’t do it anymore. My self worth was less than dirt, my depression and anxiety was ready to kill me. My secret was that I was gay and terrified how my friends/coworkers would respond. But I did it. I came out and was the best thing I ever did…so I thought. 

Shortly after coming out I would be called a queer by my coworkers and teased for it. I felt so low. That I made a huge mistake by just wanting to be happy and be me. When my managers failed to address the situation, I left. I felt the weight fall off my shoulders the minute I accepted a new job. 

Let’s fast forward again. I start the new job, super excited about how much I’m going to learn with a new company. It started well…but took a quick turn downhill. I had a very small picture of my partner and I on my desk. I finally felt comfortable enough to do this. Well, a few days later a coworker came up to me and said “oh so you don’t eat pussy”.  Once again I was back to feeling so small and worthless, just for being me. After this, the training stopped, the help stopped, and so did my motivation for wanting to do a good job. I even got an email from a coworker saying “I will end you”. I felt like the child who got bullied at school. I just wanted to disappear.

3 months later I left that job too. Some day soon I hope to find a company that’s accepting to the lgbt community. I can’t help who I am, and I’m damn sure not ashamed of it. I made a promise to myself to never let a company take away my pride of who I am, so the job search continues. In 2022 I was certainly hoping that society would be more accepting of individuals who are “different” from them. I guess I still have a lot to learn about the world.",1644152883.0

So let's be responsible, reasonable, and create party guidelines.

- Not just establishing minimum wages, but establishing laws that monitor wages and a branch of the DoL to enforce it. This should stimulate growth through the economy.

- Instead of taking a full salary while a politician, part of the salary would go to the constitution area/territory to set up social programs be it drug recovery, homeless shelters, public transportation, or community centers.

- Establishing a law that prevents a more then 10-1 ceo-employee pay structure (or something reasonable I'm just spitballing here). There will be ways around this, but it's a start.

- Nationwide salary reporting on job posts.

- Small business start up fund programs easier to access.

- Salary range reporting on corporate levels to prevent pay gapping.

Obviously there will have two ranges to the party because gun laws and abortion stances don't fit in to the party basis, and I don't want to start that debate here. Also tax stand point would fluctuate depending on the national need. There will be times where breaking tax's will be better for the working class but raising them will be good for national security or social programs.

They have also missed last month’s amendments to my wages too.

However, my biggest concern is the response I received. Granted my attitude wasn’t the best however, I’m surely well within my employee rights to act as such when my wages are incorrect. All I said was that; “my wages are incorrect for the hundredth time…” - “Can you please amend as soon as possible, please!” I feel that what wasn’t ‘abusive’ as they were implying on their responses. Their attitude was abysmal toward me, threatening me… 

Their responses were as follows;

“I have forwarded this to our payroll bureau.
It will be rectified as always. 

Please be very careful with the way that you speak to myself, my brother and the manager.

Neither your attitude nor such abusive emails will not be tolerated.

Best regards”.

The second was as follows;

“Though we appreciate your concerns and take all staff issues seriously, as well as hoping to rectify said issues efficiently and speedily, I will not take such crude disrespect as you have shown in this email as well as your behaviour when I see you. We have been nothing but good and caring as employers and if you do not appreciate it, you are welcome to seek employment where your lack of respect if much more appreciated”. 

To avoid confusion, there are 2 employers. And to add context to the matter. My father passed away before Christmas and their attitude was, “compassionate leave, we don’t do that here”. One of the employers has actively tried to avoid me when he’s in and also hasn’t spoken to me since. Hence the, “as well as your behaviour when I see you” remark. 

I was just wondering what would be the best way to proceed about the matter and who’s best to contact.

I have been watching this sub for a few days and it was really surprising the contrast between how the US markets itself as a land of incredible opportunity and wealth, and the actual reality for everyday average American.

America is truly unique, however not in a good way. Maybe just replace the word unique with (odd). You live in an odd nation my friends.

I live in a (what you consider) third world, relatively poor country. I make just around average income for our standards (about 880 USD/month).

I am 27 and have a BSC degree which cost me around (4500 USD/5 years). I could get MBA and PHD for another ~5000 USD. Married, with one child. My wife doesn’t work (she doesn’t need to, we are both happy with her taking care of our home and child). I drive a good old Toyota Corolla (nobody need a huge money pit gas guzzler SUV that’s expensive to own and maintain, trust me). Never paid a cent on healthcare or medicine. 

I can retire at 45 and get 50% of the latest salary, or at 55 and get 60%, or at 65 and get 70% (it scales up every month, you get the idea). And if I die my wife takes my salary so I will die not worrying about her. 

We have unemployment and some poverty, but absolutely zero homelessness. Every city has a government hospital where a citizen simply walks in with his ID and he gets treated by government employed doctors. Everything is covered except unnecessary operations like (beauty surgeries, etc..)

This is not extraordinary, this is how the rest of the world works. This is how every nation works or tries to work. In here nobody gives a fuck about politics, we never debate this or that. I was always bewildered how Americans in debt (negative net worth) keep saying things like (at least we have freedom and liberty), nobody really cares or thinks about these things, only Americans do. We care about our families, we spend time with our friends, attend weddings, etc… We love our country, but we don’t hang huge flags on our mortgage homes, or keep reminding ourselves how lucky we are to be born here. It’s irrelevant in 99.99% of the time. Our politics revolve around us, the population. 

My friends you need to wake up, you have a beautiful country, fix it. Your politicians care so much about China and Russia and the Middle East that they have forgotten completely about you. 

I really respect America and the American people, I met a few and I believe you have inherent genuine goodness as a population, always helpful and always positive attitude. Fix your country people. 🎩",1644147194.0

My performance was evaluated by my parents when I was young, then all throughout school. I thought once I'd work with adults all that sh\*t is gone. Nope... It's worse than ever.

I asked her why? She responded ""I'm sure you can understand that it is not sustainable to have everyone working penalty rates. If I need more assistance on weekends you will be called in.

So basically my regular pay has dropped by around $200 per week. Same hours. Out of nowhere and with not alot of reasoning.

sltb03,Possible unlawful termination?,11,0.75,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sltb03/possible_unlawful_termination/,9,"
 
Needed a place to vent. My story is a little unique. I moved to a new city at the end of 2020 for a sales position with a large medical device company. I immediately noticed I was the only African American sales representative in the region. There was an employee that was set to retire at the end of 2021 and I was being brought in to take over his position and inherit his existing business once retired. My first 6 months were great and I received exceeding expectations on my performance review. 8 months into my employment our division was restructured and I got a new manager.

During my first meeting with my new manager I let her know of the plans that my previous manager had set forward, however my new manager belittled me and said I would not be inheriting any accounts and that I would be solely responsible for creating any and all business from scratch. My manager then started to add extra work load on me ""to see how much I could handle"" and to started sending frequent requests to me. The disparate treatment continued over the next couple of months but I stayed strong. I questioned my Caucasian teammates if they were receiving similar requests and they said they were not. It seemed like my manager was trying to force formal disciplinary action upon me such as PEL or PIP to terminate me but was unable to because I abided by all requests. 

My manager then showed extreme favoritism and allowed a young Caucasian member on the team to inherit every account from the retiring teammate. They then hired another Caucasian person to take over my duties and without warning laid me off, in a single person RIF citing “reduction in force due cost reduction measures due to legitimate business needs."" I was the only person to be laid off and the only African American sales rep in the district and region. I filed a claim with the eeoc for racial discrimination and the company responded and said I had a lot of performance issues.

 I never received any warnings or had been on a performance plan and my unemployment was approved. I had exceeding expectations on my performance review so I don’t understand why these issues only came up after I filed a claim. Didn’t seem very legitimate especially that they continued to hire more people. Any thoughts?",1644141777.0

The conditions aren't awful but certainly far from great either. On my first day I asked to be paid more than the minimum wage offered, which was agreed but then he told me not to discuss the pay with the others. Naturally any employer alluding to their staff not discussing wages is a red flag.

One of my biggest gripes as a delivery driver is the payment per delivery of £1 which is showed off as a big incentive but in actuality its only 30/40p or so when you take into account your costs. 

I am a firm believer of collective barging bring the best method to improve workers conditions and I am personally part of a union already. However, I believe a union that covers all the employees, in the branch at least,  is in a much better position.

I also have some reservations. I have never attempted anything like this before and I can imagine it being a seriously dragged out process, though an essential one nonetheless. I am fortunate enough that I don't have many expenses so to lose my job over something like this wouldn't phase me it, the crushing feeling of losing to big business I worry will. 

Secondly, some of the employees are from the same country as management, they speak in their own language, a little of which I understand, and I'm concerned their friendly relationship with management may cloud their judgement in this decision which is obviously frustrating as ultimately it will benefit them more than myself as I will most certainly be leaving after my studies.

Any and all advice on this would be much appreciated, maybe from those who have undertaken a similar task.

Because I might've had Covid the day after I started training, my training has been weirdly chopped up and I'm assuming is messing with my schedule, because I'm not on the schedule at all, I just come in when I'm asked to. All my hours are still tracked and I have receipts with my hours. 

I've been working there for 2 weeks now and haven't gotten paid. I was warned the first paycheck would PROBABLY be in a check and not direct deposit, so I came in once I clean for Covid, no check. Because I'm overnight the manager couldn't do anything because it was out of the hours they could. I was given a number to call about it, I did but no one picked up and I never got called back. After a day I got $50 unlabeled, figured it was my pay and let it go. 
It was my check from my last paycheck at my old job, I only noticed this a day ago because that's when I saw it was labeled.

I'm supposed to be paid on Fridays, I've now worked about 25 hours (again, everything was chopped up because of my possible Covid) and there's nothing. It's now about $400 I'm missing.

TLDR; Have been working 2 weeks, haven't been paid for even though it's supposed to pay weekly.

My issues why I haven't done anything because: 
1. One of the managers (overnight, doesn't manage the pay from what I know, so I don't know how right she is) said I might have to wait until I've worked a week in hours 
2. I don't know what to do. The line I'm supposed to call won't pick up and that's the line the managers would call anyways. Who would I contact about this outside of the HR who don't pick up?

There are two main ways of making this money:

1) Get a Job(which you hate since you're here)
2) Take risks, start a business, invest in stocks/crypto/other businesses/real estate, etc. all the rich man bullshit

Now here is where the dilemma starts.

If you hate work you probably hate how unethical it tends to be.
You can choose to stay and hate your life or quit and take the risks mentioned above and enjoy your life
However, most of the things mentioned above is unethical

If you start a business, you become the boss you hated so much
If you invest in crypto currency, well... you are harming the enviroment
If you invest in stocks, you are profiting off of others success, it is basically strategic gambling
If you invest in real estate, you usually won't live in it, which means you are taking away someones home for the sake of profit

If you don't do these unethical things, then you are likely to lose money, and you'll be back to where you started.",1644137063.0

I texted my friend who also worked at the same place and asked if she could cover, and she said yes. Texted my boss and told her I had to go to urgent care and that I had someone coming in to cover for me. 

She told me no, and that they needed me.

Keep in mind I did work at a restaurant and was calling out on a Friday, which is usually the busiest day— but also keep in mind that I did have someone that was going to cover for me. 

I was so shocked that she outright told me I couldn’t go to urgent care. I sat there for a couple minutes staring at the text, unsure of what to do, and then finally came to my senses and got super upset about it. Then and there I told this woman that I would not be working for her anymore and that I would not be comfortable coming back. I had some other choice words I wanted to say, but wanted to stay professional considering I was already quitting without any previous notice. 

So I didn’t go to work and left it up to my boss to figure stuff out, because I was DONE at this point. Management of this place was crappy as it was before this night. 

Later on in the night, about an hour or so after the restaurant closed, I got a text from my boss where she specifically told me that she had to cover for me(even though I told her my coworker said she would cover for me) and that by doing so, she couldn’t pay her utility bills. She continued with a whole paragraph of things that are not appropriate to be talking to an (ex)employee about. It was incredibly unprofessional. She is also maybe 30 or 35 years older than me which I thought made her reaction even more inappropriate. 


I didn’t like working for other people before this- its just never been something I enjoyed in any field. In fact, every job I’ve had I ended up quitting because I just hated having to work underneath someone. I don’t like desk work, I don’t like maintenance work, I don’t like customer service, restaurant environments… I’ve tried a lot, and this really made me realize that it’s not the job, it’s the management. And every single time it was bad management. 

So… let’s just say, I will be working for myself from now on! Lol. Good thing I already had a pretty stable side hustle going on, otherwise I would be completely screwed after rage quitting. 

To anyone who’s made it to the end of this… do NOT stand for employers walking over you. They don’t have any right. If they didn’t have us employees, they’d have nothing. End of story, close the book.

The executives, directors, managers…bloated middle management that offer zero effort in terms of actual manufacturing…absolutely take the lions share of that average. Probably more than half of the new employees they plan on hiring will be at a poverty wage. While the semiconductor industry is the fastest growing sector of our economy, once again the people who make this all work get left in the dust. We HAVE to realize our power.

I’m sure I’ll be downvoted to the center of the Earth because I dare complaining from a privileged position, BUT I’ve been a scientist for over 15 years and worked in several research institutions;  reading this sub made me realize how bad the work conditions are for academics (and I’m not talking about American scientists in particular, this applies to all of us).
We are almost always forced (verbally by the boss and morally by the fear of losing funding) to work insane hours running experiments and publish our results on high-impact journals - the “publish or perish” grind. 
Only a few of us land a permanent position, the other 99% is funded by short-term fellowships or contracts, but in most (if not all) countries there’s a limit to the years one can receive these (in my country it’s 6 years). After that we either win a research grant (salary + research money) or we’re out of business.
We are chronically underpaid and the reason is that we have no unions. Nobody cares to even create one because of how fast we turnover.
