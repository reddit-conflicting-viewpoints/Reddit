sog7bu,Story Game Recommendations?,1,0.6,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sog7bu/story_game_recommendations/,25,"So currently, I don't really have jack shit to play. Everything I have I've either beaten, quit due to toxicity (cough R6 cough) or the ending got spoiled (what are the fucking chances someone is still posting the ending to Fallout 4 and Dying Light in 2022). I just don't have anything to play rn, and it makes me sad cause I do really fucking enjoy video games, but I have no drive to play them rn. 

 My favorite games so far are both Portals, Detroit Become Human, and Titanfall 2 (the campaign, as soon as I bought the game the servers went down, so I got like 2 or 3 online matches in before it broke. fun as hell while it lasted). 

My main and pretty much only issue with all 3 of those games is how little time they took. I beat both portals in 2 days, beat the Titanfall 2 campaign in like 5 hours, and finished Detroit in 2. I've played all 3 of these in the past year, and each one actually made me excited to get home from school and hop on the same way they did as a kid. Just trying to find that again.

So I'm looking for story games that will last me longer than a day. I know I mentioned Dying Light and Fallout 4, and again fucking TikTok spoiled both game's endings, so I'm not really as into playing them anymore. Probably still gonna finish Fallout tho since it's fucking great so far. But I want a game that I can feel attached to the characters, something where I'm genuinely into it. I don't really care about graphics or age, recommend as far back as you like cause I probably haven't played it (strict parents are fun). Idk if this is too much to ask or not, but any and all help is welcome. Also, any game in general too I guess, doesn't have to be a story game, I've just had the best experience with story games so far. Thanks!",1644420416.0

I mean like features that let you immerse better into the world and simply take in the ambiance. Where your character can just build a zone to relax, sit down, sleep, eat, drink and just taking the time in that world before heading out to more adventures and fights. Most games are rushing from one point to the next or the one that do offer similar features are simply lowered down like they let your character rest but you are stuck in some sort of menu to do other things like watching over your character's skill and so on which is of course nice but once you done it you done it and then you wanna leave that menu but can't chill around. This is why I appreciate walking feature so much in games where the character is usually on the run to remind you to relax from time to time.

They got the actors behind Pablo, Kelly, Shelly, Scott, to lend their voices to their movie and show roles 


There will be no story mode for the game, Tim Wilitis who worked with ID for many years on the Quake Franchise, Doom, Rage and now runs Saber interactive has stated in an interview that there will be a few single player missions, and offline multiplayer being playable with A.I. bots but the main focus of the game is asymmetrical multiplayer with PVP/PVE gameplay. 


The S-Mart, Army Of Darkness Medievel Armor Ash, and Evil Dead 1 Ash skins are locked behind preorder dlc and not unlockable in the main game. 


The ""Collectors edition"" which comes with a replica Necromicon Ex Mortis, Vinyl Soundtrack, hardcover art book, dlc codes for a Savini designed ash skin, army of darkness knight outfit, Evil dead 1 ash skin, s-Mart uniform skin, has already been sold out due to scalpers getting their hands on the preorders too. 


It's a PVP/PVE focused experience where 4 players will work together to stop the Deadites from causing chaos in the multiplayer maps available, with each character a different class, while one player gets to play as a Kandarian demon using the environment, deadites, and eventually be able to possess players. 


The car is somewhat useable in cutscenes and traveling to certain areas of the map when needed. 


It will be on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X, PS5 and Nintendo switch. 


I can expect people to be trolls as any asymmetrical multiplayer experience by spawn killing, team killing, cheating with hacked bots, ruining the game for all of the people that play it. 


Bruce says this is the definitive evil dead experience in the interview with Geoff Keighly, and Tim Wilitis but I don't think it is to be honest. I don't think a lot of the Evil Dead fanbase was asking for a multiplayer PvP and PVE style experience from the franchise.",1644412898.0

My brother and i was wondering if there was a game for PS4 that is a little similar to World of Warcraft, not an MMO, but just for playing him and i online, as we just moved away from our parents, ans would like an online game, but not a game that require us to be online at specific times and not monthly payments, as we both are studying and don't have the time to play as often.
Just an online role playing game we can play together.

Heard about diablo III and Divinity original sin II, but are there others? And what would you recommend of the two?

No real objective at all, do what you want and no need to have a map with 800 side missions that have no meaning at all. SotC is a bit more linear but it doesn't feel that way due to the vast open world map it has. 

Lately there has been a tendency with open-world games where there's a minimap and 200 side quests that you don't need to do but are ""forced"" on the screen. Far Cry 3 was the first game in this category that I played and I enjoyed it, but I also think it's the last one of its kind I've finished. I tried playing The Witcher 3 and I ended up quitting because the amount of things that were happening on the map gave me anxiety and the experience ended up being frustrating instead of enjoyable.

The games in the Dragon Quest series (well, VIII and XI, the ones I've played) also do this very well IMO. There are side quests but they are much less in quantity and really feel ""optional"". They aren't forced to the player.

I dunno, it's just something about the idea of mankind messing around with their own biology that appeals to me. Those that I know of that go deep into this are Space Marines from Warhammer 40k and Spartans from Halo. Technically, the details of those are in the books, but since they're also in videogame format and there are a lot of super soldiers that I'm not aware of in videogames, I thought this might be an appropriate place to ask.

There are some details on Cyberware from the Shadowrun franchise, but they don't go in-depth with that. The Starcraft books talk about the difference between Ghosts and Spectres, but those are mostly differences in training and the latter having exposure to Terrazine. No details on whether or not these individuals have undergone any body mods. And I don't know if there are any comics out there that talk about what exactly the Super Soldier Serum in Marvel does outside of ""This sauce makes you awesome"".

XCOM EW has the Gene and Mech Troopers, but they don't go deep enough to tickle my fancy. The Mass Effect games have lore pertaining to biotics and implants, but iirc it's only really limited to biotics.

It looks good, it feels good, and the overall quality of the game is pretty high. Sure, you can see where some of the element's kind of remind you of a gacha style game, but it's not pushing anything on you, and I've certainly not run into anything that would make me feel like I need to purchase anything beyond the base game that I've already paid for. Though I have to say, the game does sort of make you feel like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, especially considering the limited success, and circumstances of New World. Its like, ""okay, this is a good game and all and I'm having fun, but where's the big nasty reveal,"" but so far, that hasn't happened. My only concerns thus far are these:

Currently, all of the content I've cleared has been fairly easy, and nothing has been particularly challenging, even solo dungeoning stuff. So I am worried/interested to see how they handle that in more of the end game content.

Second, there are a lot of currencies in this game, between rapport and silver and gold and everything else, so that becoming a heavy focus for cash grab, and being a potential avenue for abuse is a concern. But obviously that's a ""take it as it comes"" kind of situation.

Overall though...its not bad. The style of game is not for everyone, and the combat system is not as...sticky? as maybe I'd like it to be. It's pretty easy to lose target focus on enemies when there's lots of trash mobs, so that can be a bit frustrating. And obviously having a lot of your abilities being directionally controlled by cursor takes some getting used to. But honestly, those are minor complaints.

All in all, time will tell if this game will live up to expectations in the long run. But as of right now, it seems to be what was promised. Which, I have to say, given the way games have been being released for the last several years now, is fucking refreshing.",1644389615.0

On to the post.

Everyone's favorite video to complain about in Halo Infinite:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof\_desync\_is\_the\_games\_fault\_less\_than\_10\_ping/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/skgvwj/proof_desync_is_the_games_fault_less_than_10_ping/)

Do you guys realize how many of those shots missed? It's not as obvious that it's a desync issue as it seems. Some shots hit the shoulder, some go over the shoulder, one of those bursts to the head at the end miss to the left. Intuitively, it looks despicably bad, but it's not as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

I think it may be a negative halo effect (no pun intended) of hearing about it, then when people who aren't as familiar with the gameplay mechanics play the game, it's automatically blamed on desync. Some of the videos I've seen clearly have nothing to do with desync, which I can only assume is blamed on that for the lack of understanding of how the game works, plus the primer of assuming desync is such an issue. For example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo\_infinites\_desync\_issue\_in\_a\_nutshell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/haloinfinite/comments/rpl0ax/halo_infinites_desync_issue_in_a_nutshell/)

Or this one, which is lag, not desync:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my\_worst\_desync\_so\_far/](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/s1xqof/my_worst_desync_so_far/)

I've personally never noticed anything out of the ordinary in Halo Infinite. In every game from COD to Halo, you sometimes wonder how tf you didn't get that kill. There's a lot of adrenaline and sometimes you just feel like it should've been a kill, but 95/100 times it's explainable outside of desync.

And that's all I've got to say about that. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

In honor of those that aren't just jumping to conclusions, here are some videos I found that *are* actually desync:

Are gamers expecting too much? 

Gaming back in the 2000s felt great; games like call of duty, guild wars, battlefield etc were great places to meet like-minded gamers, catch up with friends & just kill some free time. 

Jumping forward to 2017 onwards, gaming has become more of an obsession, with many gamers even threatening developers over social media. Games like Cyberpunk, Battlefield 2042, and now the recently released Dying Light 2 have all undergone intense feedback. 

Something that I see on a daily basis is the ""I want a refund"" threads started in every sub-category of gaming across reddit. As someone who has a normal career path (engineer), I find it hard to believe that people are upset over spending £60.00 on a game they didn't like, its just £60.00. Many spend more than this on cosmetics, clothes, or even takeaways in a single week. 

So my main question is, are gamers no longer gaming for fun? 

Is gaming addiction a much bigger problem than we thought?

Is the gaming community just insanely hard to please?

Is £60 supposedly wasted a big deal? After all, games play no meaningful role in reality or society.",1644366463.0

I've never heard of this problem and genuinely don't know who to talk to about it.

I come from a very competitive fighting scene, me and my friends started in dragonball xenoverse, before moving to games like fighter Z, blazblue, guilty gear, tekken etc.

We were very present in the dragonball scene. We were normal weebs just having fun until they released the esl online ""tournaments"". Then everything changed.

We turned our lives into ""Work, Eat, Train, Repeat"" for a very long time. It became more than a game to us. We probably took it more seriously than we should have. 

We spent a very long time fighting eachother and naturally wanted to expand our skillsets, seeking random players to fight, often calling on multiple players to fight us individually.

Winning these 1v2/1v3 fights is the singlehanded, most intense power trip i have ever experienced. The only time i've come close to this feeling is in dark souls, successfully defending against multiple invaders simultaneously. 

Most of us have moved on to more casual things. I didn't. Every game i play seems to revolve around this desire to feel unimaginable power. And i find myself bored if i can't satisfy the feeling in me. 

I constantly feel like i have to practice to be better than my friends, it feels almost toxic when they want to have a good time and i simply can't help but obliterate them. I can't laugh, i can't say anything or give them advice because it feels so toxic, to the point where i don't want to play with my friends in fear of going overboard or ruining what could have been a good time.

I hate it because i genuinely enjoy casual games and playing with my friends, but simply can't play them anymore for this reason. Its almost addictive. I loved heavy rain, indigo prophecy and the life is strange games. But for the life of me i could not play detroit become human, despite loving the story, characters and world to death. 

Is this just a me thing? Should i stop playing games all together? Should i talk to a psychologist?",1644357610.0

The only thing that bugs me is the total lack of realism, like I can sometimes use console to kill the HUD, but sometimes the enemies are total bullet sponges and still fight hard after taking 3 headshots on highest difficulty. I used to play some hardcore multiplayer and enjoy it, but most of those games are pretty much dead, especially when it comes to hardcore mode (I know people play BF4 still, but it's multi and it's non-hardcore).

Are there any **SINGLE-PLAYER** games where I could enjoy a fair bit of realism and follow the story? **I'm talking about historical/modern setting, I don't like horror games like STALKER or METRO.**

All I could find is PUBG and some modern shooters, but I'm pretty picky about the multiplayer thing and I'd rather replay some CoD: Black Ops campaing. I also tried TARKOV, but this is absolutely not my style (save for firefights) - I play like 2-3 hours max per week and anything that requires more than 20 minutes is absolute no-no to me. I just seek casual relax (like CoD quick deathmatch), not grinding.

-The battle system was boring. Nothing to sneeze about.

-The game was pretty. I love Toriyama's art style.

Please don't hate me for this okay if your game is not included. I might have just forgotten it (for example I just edited and added Fallout 2).

&#x200B;

Take in mind this is someone who's over 30 years of age, have little patience to playing game with exact same gameplay throughout the game like Bubble Bobble for NES and doesn't really like ""NES hard"" games that are just brutally difficult mostly because of lack of vision, poor controls or how your character is limited with a certain type of move set.

This is not necessarily 1 game per franchise if there's enough good reasons to include more than 1 game, especially with Mario/Zelda franchise there's been a lot of great titles with each unique style story and gameplay.

&#x200B;

Just for an example, I didn't include Zelda 1 which for me is not really worth revisiting when you got games like Oracles of Ages/Seasons for Gameboy Color, which have more story, better action, more puzzle elements, overall more interesting mechanics. I know Zelda 1 is the first of the franchise and it does play historically important role.

Also the game on the list **has to have great gameplay**, not game like Disco Elysium (which I've played to completion) where your character is very stiff and most actions are RNG based.

&#x200B;

Due to games in NES receiving sequels and remakes for SNES, and/or SNES games get remakes for GBA, and so on, you'll find that some games you think belong in lets say Mario 3 for NES, that's actually shifted to GBA section.

&#x200B;

So here's my qualifications (doesn't necessarily have to meet all qualifications):

* Great gameplay where you feel having direct and precise control of your character, characters or troops
* Great soundtrack
* Has a progress throughout the game with new mechanics
* Hard but fair (at least most of the game, looking at you Mike Tyson)
* Has an interesting story and characters
* Really a pioneer of it's time

Reasons to not include:

* Driving games, sports games (just my personal taste, I've played plenty of Mario Kart and F-Zero for example, still own the GBA versions of those games, just don't think they are worth revisit)
* Tycoon/Sims games (yeah I've played TTD and SimCity 2000 and Theme Hospital, Sims and all that... there's got to be something to do other than just generate money on the game)
* Mostly story based game like **Star Trek 25th Anniversary edition**, where you spend 95% of the lime listening dialogue... again just my personal distaste. If I want to watch a series, I'd rather watch series.

# Special mentions

* Minit (indie)

Really fun and original idea. The execution falls a little bit short but it's cool little fun to be had.

&#x200B;

* Ori and the Blind forest / Will of the Wisp (indie)

Just incredible artwork and atmosphere. Especially in sequel you got so much late game abilities and completing that 100% of all health and orbs is great fun when breezing through the fields in fluid animation.

&#x200B;

* Mark of the Ninja (indie)

Really **love** this stealth game but it's a little dry on music. Each execution is really tasty but could use a little spicing up in the gameplay. The different suits don't offer too much variety due to the nature of the game.

&#x200B;

* Terraria (indie)

Great game which offers a ton of hours of mining minerals and crafting gear, building houses for your NPC's to visit. Epic boss battles and items you get as loot provide enough variety. And each zone has their own music to play. If the suits offered slightly more variety and game didn't rely so much on late game magic to be interesting, it'd be probably up there with others. Most random combat encounters need also spicing up, reputation systems... ahh... it's just not there yet... but when it has more things to do and customize... oh man.

&#x200B;

* Tales of Symphonia (GameCube)

I really loved this game when I played it first time. It has one of the best music of the 4 tales games I've played to completion. Its just the character animation outside of the combat is really terribly acted, and puzzles are just annoying and take far too long to solve.

&#x200B;

* Lion King / Aladdin (dos)

What can I say, they are just good old classics. Never managed to beat Lion King when I was kid. Aladdin was also similar where I got only once to the final stage to fight Jafar in his human form. Really  great levels but slightly too punishing due to lack of vision in the lava stages and the amount of maximum stretched jumps required in the lamp stage was just too much for my nerves.

So, few years ago (2010 to 2014)  I used to have a PC and play lots of games. My dad used to set it up for me,  so I had nothing to worry about. But life kicked in and I said goodbye to gaming for some years. 

Fast forward to 2022, I can finally buy my own PC! But I'm not sure about putting the parts together. Don't want to bother my dad, specially because he doesn't do this kind of stuff since 2014 (maybe he won't know how to anymore?). But the company is charging like 200 bucks to put it together. I remember, from my teenager years, that my dad would take like 40 minutes top to do it, and he was extremely cautions and perfectionist at it.

I'm not trying to belittle the company's job, I'm sure they are very good at this... But I really don't know if it is too much and if I should seek other professionals (or maybe try it on my own).

snpojw,What are your favorite boss arenas in the Soulsblood series?,1,0.6,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/snpojw/what_are_your_favorite_boss_arenas_in_the/,2,"1. Maneater from Demon's Souls - The fight is definitely flawed but the narrow arena makes the boss interesting more than anything else. 

2. Gravelord Nito from Dark Souls - I love the pacing this encourages with the center piece causing a divide between small and large skeletons. Any unaware players can mistakenly trigger the large skeletons for a more intense battle but a knowledgeable player can properly keep distance. However the entrance is a bit cheap especially if you don't use spells for the drop damage. 

3. Dragonrider from Dark Souls 2 - The boss may be very exploitable but it's an arena that rewards exploration that benefits the player with more platforming. I love the idea but it needs to be more punishing in my opinion. 

4. Micolash, Host of the Nightmare from Bloodborne - I've learned to appreciate this boss more over the years and it's arena definitely stands out. It works like a fun house and oddly has variety for a puzzle fight which the arena design greatly accommodates. 

5. Ancient Wyvern from Dark Souls 3 - Not a great boss but definitely a well designed obstacle course. I even had players compete to see who could go through it the fastest and it was an absolute blast. 

6. True Corrupted Monk from Sekiro - Sekiro doesn't have many unique arenas in terms of hostile design but I found that this boss arena had the most going for it with optional stealth by hiding in the trees and the narrow bridge forcing the player to get close to the boss.",1644341320.0

I’m playing GTAO for years now and I’m recently moved to another country due work. 

My problem now with GTAO is that every session I join now has these very annoying Chinese chat spammers and modders. I think it’s due to network localization because of where I live now. (Istanbul). 

I moved from Europe to Turkey for work and also am going to live there for a while. It’s nice and great but the servers of GTAO is just so awful now.

I can’t connect with my friends because for some reason the connection drops (VPN). And if I don’t use VPN and my friends join me, the Chinese spammers and modders appears and ruins our gameplay. 

So I often join them instead they join me but the problem is that they sometimes the annoying people still join our session. 

So now I do not know if I can name the VPN application here but I use one paid VPN for several reasons and I tried to play GTAO with it but the connection is so poor. 

I kindly want to know if some other GTAO players also uses VPN and how their experiences are. 

I also would love to know which VPN is the best for gaming. Or just for GTAO.

But some games stand up to the test of time far better than others. Chances are even if you've never played Chrono Trigger you've heard of it and know a little about it. Likewise we all know about Super Mario RPG despite it not being released on any console in over a decade don't we? And even if you'll never play Fallout New Vegas you know the fans are like missionaries trying to convert you to a new religion because of what it does with characters, quest design, and dialogue.

It was me who was garbage, three other teammates who were also garbage, and Ark vs. the sweatiest team of SnD players I've ever seen. Every round went almost exactly the same. We would rush a site while Ark lurked with a .50, get almost immediately domed by three enemies with awps, and maybe chunk one or two. Then Ark was in a 1v4-5, where he started popping heads. In vr. With a gun that has no sights. Every round he had about 3 of us buying him the .50 so he could get body armor or whatever it was. The other team would get progressively more irritated at Ark's godhood to the point 3 of them would typically break off to intercept his usual route. Despite all that hard carrying and how hard the other team was stomping us and our general incompetence, nobody was being a huge asshole on the mic or constantly calling us garbage and everybody had a great time.

So these are the two I enjoyed while stoned, and the why:

1. Control. The game's already a confusing mindfuck, I feel like it was designed to be played stoned. Nothing is what is seems, the hallways move, objects teleport, the walls drip blood (but only sometimes)... you know just a total mindfuck.
2. Disco Elysium. A game that simulates the mechanics of a table top RPG. You're a cop in a fictional word whose abused drugs and alcohol so heavily that you have amnesia. Solve a murder investigation with the help of your partner before shit goes pear shaped. You can fail a skill check so hard while doing an autopsy that you shoot the corpse, the whole game is just as absurd.

In terms of the more inhuman characters of Bioshock, del Toro's work in The Shape of Water or even Pan's Labrynth should be evidence enough that he could bring something like Big Daddy to life on the silver screen. Also anyone who watches Nightmare Alley would have a hard time arguing that Cate Blanchett wouldn't be an amazing Dr Tenenbaum.

Here is what I remember:

The game is like a futuristic type game that takes place in a sky/cloud type setting with large buildings coming out of the clouds. The characters are walking towards each other on a bridge type thing and then end up fighting over a briefcase like object. The characters keep like knocking it away from each other and shooting guns and rockets, and then like smirking at people. 

There's some other details which I'm a little fuzzy on, that may or may not be part of it, such as one of the guys having a robotic arm and there being like a female character with dreadlocks. and there is some sort of aerial combat, like jetpacks, rocket jumps, or wind currents or something like that.

By realism I mean bullets actually appear to hurt people, and show blood pools and splatters. Nice euphoria ragdolls would be nice too.

I think I've given it enough honestly , the game is simply not fun at all , after the intro to the game they were already shoving down the Batmobile through my throat , it was unbearable how many puzzles you have to complete with the Batmobile alone , In those 2-3 hours I played I felt like they used the Batmobile too much 

 combat was so fast that I couldnt even see wtf Batman was even doing half of the time , it was almost as if he was flying enemy to enemy just to kick their teeth in 

I felt like the flying was just underwhelming , it was smooth but imo I felt like he was dropping to fast and the camera was always facing down while flying which was so sad to me because I really just wanted to fly and look at the city but the camera didnt let me

Something else about the camera was that in combat it was so shitty , I had it on auto focus on enemies ot something like that and it was bad since it would jump everywhere and then I tienes it off and the camera would follow batman but since he was always fighting and moving around it would just start spinning...

Is it just me that didnt enjoy Batman Arkham... does it get better later on gameplay and story wise?? Should I redownload if I didnt like the first 2 hours of it?",1644290211.0

In order to do this, I’ll list my past favorite games/genres for context, then list what elements I like in games as a whole, and finally I’ll leave it up to you to make some suggestions that you have in mind, considering (or not at all considering) the info I list here.

Past Favorite Genres/Games:
- Looter Shooters (I.e. Destiny, Destiny 2)
- Action RPGs/Soulslikes (All dark souls games, bloodborne, Remnant.
- Competitive/Esports games (Rainbow 6, CSGO, any and every fighting game lol, League of Legends)

I’ve spent hours and hours playing competitive games (and specifically fighting games), but really haven’t found true enjoyment from them. I really enjoy the multiplayer aspect of these games, but at the end of the day I’ve come to realize that they aren’t truly fun for me. Fighting games prove to be somewhat of an exception here, as I find them to be fun, but it’s also true that with these games I get easily burnt out on trying to get good (something I usually fail to accomplish anyway). Outside of this general context, I’ll next list some of the general things I like in games.

Game Aspects I like:
- Multiplayer/social aspect
- some form of skill acquisition/progression 
- fast paced gameplay
- enjoyable combat
- easily runnable on most systems (not necessary)
- actually interesting single player content 
- weapon variety // varied weapon/armor customization options 

At the end of the day, I feel that it may be a good idea to explore/try some other game genres, because maybe I’ll end up finding something new that I like. So, to conclude this, what are your suggestions?

sn6yla,Must Play CRPGs,1,0.6,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sn6yla/must_play_crpgs/,12,"Ok, so I remember looking at games like Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight, Ori, Super Meat Boy, Cuphead... and thought, alright this is definitely for kids, even though I was a kid myself lol. but now someone recommended some newer games like Hades, Disco Elysium, Inscryption and Nobody Saves The World and said you have to play them, and after I did I was like holy \*\*\*\* these games are amazing and so much fun especially Disco Elysium which was even more than amazing.

After that I found the CRPG genre and there were so many games with many different opinions. Also as a mostly AAA gamer (CoD, Far Cry...), I know next to nothing about these games so when someone says ""Pillars of Divinity is absolutely great, the story, the characters, everything"" and another guy comes and says ""pillars is completely forgettable and you're better off playing the superior old CRPGs."" I'm not sure who to believe lol.

So here I am looking for the Must Plays, and for some reason my brain can't handle the fact of playing something newer like Baldur's Gate 3 before playing 1 or 2, so from old to new would be appreciated. I've also heard some great things about Planescape Torment which seems to be pretty old, so if you think a game is worth playing even today because of the gameplay, story or both, again the recommendation would be appreciated.",1644283159.0

sn63sg,Playstation's refund policy is borderline a scam.. it's going to drive consumers away and they couldn't care less..,0,0.27,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sn63sg/playstations_refund_policy_is_borderline_a_scam/,30,"I'm just gonna say it cuz it's true. Every other platform allows you to download a paid product, usually has a 2 hour time-frame for you to try the game, see if it's broken or has issues until you are locked out of a refund.. that's fair and reasonable and seems to work well because it's also usually supported by automated systems.

&nbsp;

Not Sony.. Hell no.

&nbsp;

Sony is supposed to uphold a marketplace for consumers where publishers and their ""finished and playable"" products make it there to be bought by consumers.. If you buy a game, download it and it's a broken mess that keeps crashing or corrupting your saves, hell i've had Black Ops games hard crash my system corrupting my entire system software forcing me to redownload the system software onto a USB stick and formatting my entire drive losing everything.. but guess what? they will still deny you a refund, why? because their policy states that the moment you download the product or have any kind of game progression, your refund is ineligible. yeah..

&nbsp;

The most asinine part of this policy is that you have to put blind faith in Sony and the publisher that their product is not broken (which is hardly the case with most games today unfortunately), but in order to even determine if a game is broken to begin with, you'd have to download the game and play it to start experiencing the above.. 

&nbsp;

Their policy is literally a scam.. they know a product is broken or they simply don't screen the products they host on their marketplace, they take consumers money, and deny them a refund after they download to find out the product is faulty then get refused their money back. idk about you guys.. but that's a god damn scam.

&nbsp;

I talked to a Sony rep about this on the phone earlier, and they literally are just robots, they don't have any human emotion or sensibility in their responses, they literally just read from transcripts based upon these policies, but that's not really a gripe because they're just people doing their jobs and making a living with what they can.. so i get it, but still.. Sony is clearly anti-consumer, all they care about is your money and greed, they don't give a shit if you never buy from them again and move to Xbox or Steam or whatever platform else, Sony is just content with their ways and don't care to change while everyone else is evolving to be better.

&nbsp;

I've supported Sony for so many years.. but enough is enough, I can't continue to support such an anti-consumer company anymore that borderline scam's their customers and doesn't blink twice about it either.",1644280844.0

I always hated the idea of top-down RPGs. But I loved Fallout and its setting.

When I come across Wasteland 3 I was full of doubts, But a post-apocalyptic world set in winter would be hard to resist. Little did I know, this game was more than that!

I took the leap of faith and bought this game.

Tbh, character creation is kinda meh. I made my characters and started the game and boom! The game throws game-changing decisions right from the start. I was like: ""Ok, now we're talking!""

The story is awesome. The game is all American, and I love it. (Am not an American though)

Let me talk about the decision-making aspect of the game a little more. See, most RPGs work like this: You want this or that? It's either path A or path B. Not in Wasteland 3. You have full freedom over your choices. The developers understood and implemented the butterfly effect at its finest. Also, the fame system allows you to actually have a process and the living world. If you made a bad decision that screwed your relationship with a certain faction, you have the opportunity to fix it.

The game is ruthless and I fucking love it. It's not afraid to swear, roast players, and break the fourth wall. I liked this constant communication between developer and player. You feel like you MATTER! The game is full of blood, craziness (I'm watching you Vic), and outlaws! Sometimes the game made you look like a badass. I was role-playing even irl (Saying dialogues and talking to my crew lol).

The voice acting is the best I've seen in a while; 10/10.

The soundtrack. Oh my god, the soundtrack! It's playing in my house all the time. The one great idea that was crazy was playing folk/rock/country music while fighting bad guys. It was genius! It made fights so epic, and I didn't want fights to end.

People said it was a buggy game, but I had a smooth experience. One or two bugs here and there, and it wasn't even game-breaking.

Spoilers ahead ...

I ended the game like this: >!As soon as I saw Patriarch, I knew I had to overthrow this guy. I don't know why, but I didn't like him. So I partnered with Angela and Cordite while obeying the orders of the Patriarch. I saved Steeltown from falling apart. I wiped out Gippers from existence and killed Valor. I arrested Vic just to avoid suspicions of Patriarch. Then killed Liberty and Patriarch. I continued sending supplies to Arizona and stayed in Colorado.!<

This game made me fall in love with CRPGs and now I bought Pillars of Eternity and Pathfinder.

Give this bad boy a try. It's so badass and an awesome game.

  Qte is so fun and adds to the adrenaline of a game because you feel like you have to hurry up or their are consequences. Detroit Become Human Uses it as a fear mechanism when you are saving someone from their father it does it to slow you down adding more fear in not making it in time. The game does other QTE in the game adding more adrenaline.  

 Until dawn also has QTE and can be amazing at making you think fast and get worried about failing to your death or get killed by something.  What if their was no QTE?  In my opinion QTE are best implemented in story based games, horror and adventure the reason being its meant to slow you down making you think fast and adds more worry and fear and rises your emotions deeper in the games.  

   Where is QTE'S bad? Well sometimes multiplayer games qte is preference but one genre that can't do qte are fighting as people get hyped about fighting bosses or using weapons to kill them all for it to be a qte scene and you don't get to fight them is just awful.

sn1cf0,Why you SHOULDN'T get a steam deck,0,0.24,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sn1cf0/why_you_shouldnt_get_a_steam_deck/,68,"(Note I was doing this earlier but my computer decided to freeze)

So some people got the Steam Deck, Valves prized child for their gamble in the console race early. It will officially release February 25th, 2022. Now I don't think I have seen a SINGLE piece of negative feedback on the Steam Deck, but doing my research, here is WHY you shouldn't get it

**Battery Life**

It's **ABYSMIAL**. It only lasts for 2-5 hours when playing. Heck, the original Switch had better battery life (2.5-6.5 hours) and the newer versions are **SO** beating it in the life department. Battery life has proven keen that it matters. The only handheld Sega did sold 11m in 7 years from 1990 to 1997 sold poorly partly do to the fact that it took SIX DOUBLE A BATTERIES because it offered color and only lasted for 4 hours, when the Gameboy took 4 and lasted 10. If you use your computer for Steam, you can play for as long as you please since it doesn't use charge

**Games**

Well for starters, it won't have every Steam Game. Now that wouldn't be a problem, if it's game weren't ALREADY ON CONSOLES FOR AWHILE NOW. Games like Cuphead, Dead by Daylight, FNAF Security Breach, NBA/FIFA, Doom, Fallout and more have already been on consoles, and this makes not having every steam game worse, because it means it might not have many exclusives, which can make or break a consoles chance of succeeding.

**Nintendo**

Yeah I don't think I have much to say. Switch is out and has the portable market secured, and with the Switch out and still kicking, it will have some heavy competition. And with a chip shortage, it will be hit harder than it could be if Nintendo's grip on handhelds wasn't a problem.

**Price**

So if you want a Steam Deck, you will fork over 400 dollars for the base model. There are two other more EXPENSIVE models, but just wait a bit for my comment on that. I don't think any portable has been that expensive, and again, poor battery life will suck. You can buy the Switch OLED Model for 350$ (not including Metroid Dread)  for a 7 inch screen, amazing colors and 64 gigabytes. Speaking of gigabytes

**Storage**

This is why I saved the other two models for now. So the base set model has 64 gigabytes. Now this wouldn't be a problem, if this was your average console, because its digital only (correct me if I am wrong). So you will be FORCED to buy those other models. How much will you get? Well you get 256 gigs for the 2nd version and 512 for the most expensive of its kind. That's great, until you get to their **STUPID HIGH PRICES. 530$ FOR THE 256 AND 650$ FOR THE 512. IN WHAT WORLD DOES A CONSOLE THAT ISN'T BEING SCALPPED COST 650 DOLLARS?? THE PS5 COSTS LESS THAN THE 256/512 AND THIS IS A DIGITAL ONLY CONSOLE, WHICH ARE LESS EXPENSIVE** (for the console itself, they will take up a lot of storage period) **WITH THE PS5 DIGITAL COSTING THE SAME AMOUNT AS THE HANDHELD STEAM DECK AT 400$, AND SERIES S COSTING LESS THAN ALL MODELS PERIOD.** Sorry for the loud rant, but WHY does a portable digital only console cost SIMILAR or more than NON PORTABLE consoles that can give more storage for less. Also they take forever to download on digital.

**Monopoly**

Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft hold a monopoly over the console part of the industry. Google, Android and others had the money, but poor presentation made their consoles flop. When EVERYONE tried to make a console during the PS1 times, they got obliterated. Sega was forced out and now only do games. In other words, the Steam Deck has heavy competition

**Size**

Another reason for why the Sega handheld failed was because of size. While it doesn't matter as much now, ITS HUNKING BIG. People make this a good thing, but it has taken a lot from the Switch and made it MUCH BIGGER. The screen may be the same size as an OLED (7 inch screen), but the console itself its HUGE. But bigger isn't always better. If you wanted to put the Switch in your pocket and it was too big because of the joy cons (well actually why would you? Put it in a bag or something so it's safer), you can take them out. The Switch OLED is similar and in general the Lite is Smaller than the Switch, so it could fit if you wanted to. BUT THE STEAM DECK IS TOO BIG. WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE THIS BIG? Remember the original Xbox controller? It was referred to as the Duke and people pointed out how it was too big. So now Valve could go down a similar path, which they CAN'T afford for this to flop as while Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft can and has shown they can afford flops, Valve is only worth 10b, which means if this flops, it's gonna hurt

**Conclusion**

Just don't buy the Steam Deck. If you want to play steam games then do it on you're computer. If you want to play their games handheld, then go for it, but why play it handheld when you can get a laptop to play their games on the go and do much more if you are bored. It's expensive, digital only (correct me if I am wrong once again), long downloads will come and its big. So therefore save money and buy an Xbox, Switch or Playstation 4 or 5 if the games you want to play are on console and use Steam on you're computer if the games you want to play are not on console, and again, not all games will be on the Deck, so if you buy it for a few games and none are on it, I am sorry for you. Anyway, hope if anyone see's this finds it informative on the Steam Deck

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Bloody ell is the button placement and parts of the design? (you can see the thing on Project KillSwitch, and people calling Nintendo fanboys salty). The D Pad, circle pads and the buttons in general are at the very top. I remember people didn't like a controller for the buttons being at top, the main person being Scott the Woz (was it a Wii 3rd party controller or a Wii U controller?) And WHAT are two big squares doing where the Y,B,A,X buttons and D Pad doing there? Are they to take out the heat from the system? Plus there are 4 L and R Buttons (remember when games that didn't need more than 10 buttons on old consoles got more than 10 buttons). And the kickstand just doesn't do it for me. The og Switch one is too skinny for me, but this is wide small high up.

Edit 2: I see people that don't see the fact that its digital only as a console as a problem. Me and Scott the Woz (Scott Wozniak) disagree.  [Digital Only Consoles - Scott The Woz - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZKU9Ader3I) ",1644268946.0

This may sound silly, but I like games like this. I remember as a teenager I would mod my favourite RPGs to make my character invincible.

I said i believe I'm entitled to a refund under the Consumer Protection Act of Ontario section 14(2)3.

It says that you are entitled to a refund if the product was misrepresented. Specifically that the goods or services are represented as being of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model but they are actually not. 

I told them that Battlefield 2042 satisfies that in two ways. It was sold as a fully functional game, where it is actually a broken buggy mess. As evidenced by the developer publicly apologizing for their failure to meet expectations. 

It was also sold as a live service, those features have just been delayed by at least six months. I also added that the live service features have already been delayed 4 months so if they manage to stick to that timeline it's still almost a year late. 

Product is not as described. This is not the AAA experience i paid for. I did not buy this as an early access title. 

The first CSA i dealt with told me it does not meet EA's eligibility for refund, and ignored the law stuff i asked about. I told her it is under Canadian law. She repeated it was not eligible and hung up on me.

Keep in mind I've played this game about three times. Probably still under ten hours. 

Not to be deterred, i started another chat with a new CSA and made the same points. He kept insisting there were ""no options available"", refused to escalate me to a supervisor, and also hung up on me. 

EA, your game is broken. Give me my god damned money.

Well, yes.  But, it also got me wondering - why don't we have more VR games for sports?  Basketball, where you could drive the lane and see a 7'2"" giant come at you to block the shot.  Football, where you're the quarterback and you're trying to look over the lineman to throw the open pass.  Hockey or soccer, where you're the goalie and can see the opposing player break open and launch a shot at you.

I've got my space fighting sim that I can nerd out over, but why (skipping over it's EA) isn't Madden or FIFA being released in VR also?

Edit for clarity:  I don't need the VR motion controls, I'd prefer using the standard controllers to play. Besides, my tired butt can't waive my arms around for two hours.",1644262696.0

So here's the thing, i've been playing Genshin for 1 year now, and as much as i love the game, i'm already at lvl 56 and appart from the monthly updates, I kind of miss discovering a new game and getting completely fixated on it. I mean, I'm not a ^(huge) gamer, but i have played here and there, mostly feel good games that have a nice story behind them and a nice gameplay. I'm not a big fan of shooting games (because i'm also not good at them) and what i've played so far was: mc (like it but it does get boring after a while), genshin, it takes two (loved it. amazing game but i can't play anymore because no more relationship), bayonetta (love it but it doesnt really get me hooked), warframe (i like it but it's very confusing at first), osu, little nightmares(another perfect game) and fnaf. As i said, i'm not a huge gamer, i only started playing 2 years ago because i never had a computer that allowed me to play (anything really). I don't know what i'm looking for but i'd love some good recomendations! I hope anyone can help me with what i've said i like, and even if it's a diferent genre but you like it, i'd be happy to take a look!

Before you say it is a health problem (I am actually checking on it this Wednesday), are there any useful options I should know about concerning brightness? I have already adjusted the brightness on gaming mode but I cannot see backlight options anywhere.

I turned down some of the contrasts and it helped a bit. The screen still seems to be too bright for me. I will try to buy some additional led lights for my room, maybe that will help, because most of my lights are of warm color so maybe that's the issue.

However, before I try these solutions out do you have any useful tips ? I've been searching through the internet for a long time and nothing seems to help me, still blurry sight after watching.

From the research I've done there's usually a dead end statement that's too personal to matter. Sometimes there's a new card to play for both side however it always comes down to the same subjective conclusion. 

The accessibility side of the argument basically ends with someone having no issues with how other people play their games offline however the article vision side of the argument doesn't like seeing beauty of difficulty compromised by accommodations. This eventually leads to someone's personal feelings that doesn't go anywhere so the argument dies basically.

Personally I'm on the artistic vision side of the argument I highly appreciate games that are purposefully built to overcome challenges and share experiences with the same conflicts in mind which is something you can't get from games with difficulty settings. These days even Hard modes are starting to get Easy modes within the settings which personally doesn't make sense to me. 

I don't care how others experience their games but don't mess with games built around overcoming challenging scenarios because I cherish sharing these moments with other dedicated gamers and when easier options are available then it's a community that doesn't appreciate the core gameplay in my opinion which is why I love games the Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro.",1644249494.0

There’s a whole spot devoted to the monsters you find out in the wild when playing the game, giving full lore and pictures of them. I absolutely love when games do this! I think it’s more rare than it should be as it really adds to the experience of the game. 

Aside from the Witcher, my other favorite series of games is Dark Souls and Bloodborne - those games do a phenomenal job of item description & that’s how we figure out the lore in those games. But can you imagine if they had a full bestiary as well to read through?? 

Maybe I’m weird, but I wanted to see if anyone else was as into these as I am 🤷‍♂️

I'm not into game pass, I'm more wait for a sale( most aaa games are broke at release anyway) shouldn't I be given a chance too buy a 'complete game' in a one off purchase, rather than be shoved in with the game pass possee.

1. Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart
2. Guardians of the Galaxy

I've reinstalled drivers (the right ones yes), put my laptop into what AMD calls ""Turbo"" But in the previously mentioned games my frames can rarely be considered smooth. The games also freeze then unfreeze every now and then. And another thing to mention is my temperatures are still in a good range while in game (around 80-90 at most).

Lately I’ve been really struggling to get into games, any games, it doesn’t matter what the genre or how much I actually *want*  to play it, I can never seem to last more than half an hour before  turning It off and mindlessly scrolling through Gamepass/my Steam  library again looking for something else, nothing can hook me anymore  and I hate it because I feel like I’m losing my passion for gaming even  though I don’t want to. I still love talking about video games and discussing them with people, but I just can't seem to sit down and *play* them anymore.

I’ll spend  the entire day at work (when I’m actually in the office because I still  work from home most of the time) thinking of a game to play and I’ll  get really excited to get home and play it, but by the time I’ve gotten  home and got myself relaxed, I just don’t feel like it anymore, I’ll  always get sidetracked by chores or the TV or something else and I can’t  seem to allow myself to ‘get in the zone’. I think working from  home is partly responsible, it was a great novelty at first but now it’s  starting to blur the line between what’s work and what’s not because my  gaming desk is now also my work desk, and my PC setup is also my work  setup and it feels like there’s no disconnection between them, and  unfortunately we don’t really have the room to spare for a second setup  somewhere else in the house. Our company is also looking to make working  from home a permanent thing and only requiring us to go into the office  a few times per month.

Has anyone  else felt like this? How did you get over it? Was there one game that  managed to suck you back in or did it require a total change in mindset?  Or is it just a product of getting older?",1644238458.0

Data was acquired through various sources, VGChartz provided a good portion of the sales data, revenue data was straight up googled by me, and market cap is public information.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: There is no single source of truth for most of this information, companies do not even need to make most of it public, as such a lot of this information (especially game sales data) is estimated or guessed, some pre-release titles are even predictions. So please do not take this as absolute fact, stats could be off from their true value but I've done my best to provide as probable an estimate as I could. If you do notice anything that is obviously totally wrong please let me know but this was only intended as a guideline.

Second Disclaimer: Companies being 'owned' by another company does not always mean here that they are an actual subsidiary, sometimes they will just have an exclusive/strong partnership I have denoted most of these cases with an asterisk (apart form Nintendo who pretty much exclusively works alongside other companies)

Third disclaimer: I know that I mix up developers/publishers a fair bit, but either can have rights to the IP of the product so I've done my best to guess who actually owns what, or if a publisher uses a different studio for each of it's games I've just used the publisher instead to minimise chart views that have just one item in them (because that's boring)

Fourth disclaimer: Some of the statistics may appear misleading, for example Microsoft's 2.2T market cap dominates Sony's, however this takes into account all of Microsoft's products like Windows/Azure etc so some comparisons may not be accurately indicative of their performance in the video game space, but it's hard to calculate how much of a stock's value is due to a specific domain so we're stuck with it for now.

Fifth disclaimer: If I forgot your favourite game I'm very sorry, this was intended to see what studios are up for grabs in this acquisition war we're seeing, and some notable titles are owned by a random independent studio who make only one game so wouldn't really add much to this graph - but if there is something somewhat major that I've forgotten to include - feel free to let me know I'll try to add it.",1644238066.0
