soxke7,Creed 3: Brother vs Brother,2,1.0,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/soxke7/creed_3_brother_vs_brother/,5,"I’m a big fan of the Creed franchise and am highly anticipating the upcoming Creed 3 directed by its star Michael B. Jordan. 

MBJ has talked a little about the story of Creed 3, saying it’s a very personal story and it’s something close to his heart. 

My speculation is Creed 3 will take some influence from the fantastic MMA film Warrior (2011) and have Adonis Creed fight is “brother”, Jonathan Majors’ character. 

Majors’ would be playing another illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, but unlike Adonis he wasn’t adopted by Mary Anne and grew up poor.

Majors’ would have a lot of jealousy and perhaps hatred for Adonis, and would be on a similar path Adonis was on in Creed 2.

This is just a theory of mine and I have no evidence for it whatsoever!

sotez4,Montgomery Clift: why is he forgotten?,8,0.69,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sotez4/montgomery_clift_why_is_he_forgotten/,10,"During his lifetime Montgomery Clift was considered the equal of his method acting contemporaries Marlon Brando and James Dean and yet both have completely eclipsed him in terms of fame. They are still well known and iconic today whereas Clift is mostly forgotten by the general public. It's ironic because Clift was actually the first of the method actors to make his film debut (before Brando and Dean) and he blew audiences away with his performance in The Search.
It was a performance that felt real and believable and it was like nothing audiences had seen before. People actually thought Clift was a real soldier and they would go up to the director afterwards asking where he found a soldier who could act so good. Clift was one of only 6 actors in film history to receive a Best Actor academy award nomination for his screen debut.

He would continue to give excellent performances in A Place in the Sun and From Here to Eternity and in the 1950's was considered among the greatest film actors of his generation. Sadly Clift had personal problems and after surviving a terrible car accident those problems only got worse. He would continue to act, but by the 1960's his career wasn't going well and he died prematurely at 45 suffering a heart attack most likely brought on by years of drug and alcohol abuse. 

It's sad that he died prematurely because I feel had he lived he would have had a comeback similar to the one Marlon Brando had in the 1970's. Brando had a string of failures in the 1960's and had to audition and get studio approval to appear in The Godfather. His salary for it was only $250,000 a far cry from the one million he received ten years earlier when he did Mutiny on the Bounty. After The Godfather Brando was so popular and iconic that he would be paid millions just for small supporting roles in films.

I bring this up with Brando because I feel had Clift lived he would have thrived in the 1970's, too and been just as popular and iconic as Brando. Most of the directors that were becoming popular in the 1970's were also huge fans of Clift. 
Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese have cited Clift as one of their favorite actors and if the character was written to be older I think he would have made a great Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. I have little doubt Clift would have taken on controversial roles and not played it safe with his acting roles and since he hated the censorship of the studio era (which ended only 2 years after his death) he would have likely felt more free and liberated with his acting roles. So much for what might have been.",1644455574.0

This is incredibly random, but I got a ""Facebook memory"" notification today about a post I made 11 years ago. My post read...  
""Ah yes... The illuminati. A bunch of kids who play Dungeons and Dragons in a basement, and plan out attacks on stuff that wind up happening in the real world! No wonder they're accused of every bad thing that has ever happened in the world!"" 

A friend had commented, ""was just watching that show."" (next part is... corrected for readability) ""Did you see where the guy's like 'you know this is how schizophrenic people see the world? How everything in the world is connected!'""   


This sounds SO familiar but I can't think of what it was. I know the Bohemian Grove video came out that year, but that was late 2011, not early February.

If it helps, I later that day made a post ""Think of it like ""Fight Club"" for rich people. Rule number one, don't talk about it. (This is in reference to the Bohemian Grove)""

somtml,MARRY ME - Webcomic to Movie,0,0.42,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/somtml/marry_me_webcomic_to_movie/,0,"
MARRY ME comes out on Valentines day starring who's it,  what's her face, and Sarah Silverman. I was an avid reader of the webcomic back in the 2010's so here is the whole plot/story as I remember if you want to compare the original to the movie;


Superstar Girl [forgot her name so she is now Superstar] is getting ready for her next big performance with the help of her *very*  pregnant sister - father of unborn baby is out of the picture.


Pregnant sister tells Superstar if she is mentally well - during the awards show two years ago Superstar proclaimed she would cure cancer within three to four years. Superstar snaps back saying she still has a few years left, and she is fine.


Meanwhile, a guy named Guy has been dragged along to Supestars concert by his BFF Parker. Parker is in love with Superstar and is hoping Superstar will sign her poster MARRY ME written on with bright red ink. Guy is indifferent. 


The concert starts and Superstar does her best but starts to fumble her words through some of her own songs. Pregnant sister brings up her concerns during the intermission but Superstar brushes it off saying it's nothing.


Out in the crowd, Parker realizes she hasnt gone to the bathroom in three days due to her excitement for Superstar. Shoves the poster into Guys hand, making him promise he would try to get Superstars signature when the time comes and runs off to pee.


Parker finds a spot in the bushes and begins her relief. Midway stream, Parker looks at the jumbotron and sees Guy getting  on stage with Superstar? And theres a priest? WTF! Parker is so distraught she stands up . . . And wets her pants. Whoops.


Guy is in Superstars dressing room, trying to comprehend what just happened while Pregnant Sister is freaking out over Superstar. To Superstars defense, she took the MARRY ME sign quite literal and accepted 'Guys proposal' . And who was that priest? Turns out one of fans is a priest and was at the show, so when Superstar asks if anyone could marry them the priest didnt hesitate to come up on stage. Also she just learns guys name is Guy and is like 'really? That's your name?'


Guy and Superstar hear a commotion outside to see Parker arguing with the bouncer how she is Guys BFF and that was *her sign*. Bouncer says 'you smell like piss.' Guy tells Superstar and bouncer Parker is with him and allow her to come back stage. Not after sticking her tongue out at the bouncer for doing his job.


Superstar gives Parker a pair of her own pants which makes Parkers life. Pregnant sister tells Superstar to get a hold of her lawyers to see if she is actually legally married to Guy before showing Superstar how people are talking about her stunt. People started to believe it was planned - the guys name is Guy for heavens sake! Superstar agrees to get a hold of her lawyers but needed to get away from it all - including her manager (over 100 missed calls within 20 minutes of the fiasco)


Superstar, Pregnant sister, Guy, and Parker all load up into her touring bus and head off to the airport to hop into her private jet to Africa - just in time to avoid her manager . .  .who is her DAD! Dun dun dun. 


Dad tracks his daughter's down to the airport and harasses the bus driver to let him know where his daughter's went. The bus driver lies and says Antarctica or the Artic. Some place cold. Dad takes the bait and heads off on his own private jet.


Time passes and the arrive in Africa - a village Superstar donates a bunch of her money towards. The villagers greet Superstar happily when pregnant sister goes hard core into labour, despite it being a few weeks early. Guy steps in, saying he delivered two babies before and even carries around the news paper article.  Superstar reads how he delivered his older sisters baby, twice. On a ferris wheel each time. 


That was the moment Superstar realizes Guy is a good guy, perhaps what she really needs in life.


Baby comes out and they get no longer pregnant sister to a hospital Superstar built with her money. The newborn boy is named Parker after Parker.


Dad finally tracks his daughter's down to Africa and rampages to the hospital to give Superstar a piece of his mind, and they legalities surrounding the marriage. He is also pissed off his first grandsons name is Parker.


The lawyers assemble and tell Superstar the facts. And the fact is her and Guy . . . .are not legally married! Superstars face drops. Deep down she wishes she did legally married Guy.


The six (Superstar, Guy, no longer pregnant sister, Parker, boy Parker, and Dad) fly back to America where Superstar and Guy start a new relationship together.


END.

It had some pretty spectacular setpieces and long takes but that only represents a pretty small portion of the movie.

Like this isnt even a very long movie and it really really genuinely felt like it could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.

Pretty weak characterization and lots of cheesy dialogue. Like the dialogue was unintentionally funny and made me laugh out loud numerous times. And theres one part where one of the main guys grabs some barbed wire and cuts his hand. But there was no good reason for him to grab the wire, and it was just a stupid way of injecting some conflict/drama into the story. At least thats how I recall that scene.

The first adapted translation from the French edition of 1885 was published in Moscow in 1886, in the printing house of the brothers E. and M. Verner, as an appendix to the magazine «Around the World». The translation by O. A. Grigorieva, published in 1904, was considered the most popular before the revolution. In the USSR, the most accessible was a good translation by N. K. Chukovsky, made in the first half of the 1930s, almost simultaneously with a less accurate translation by M. A. Zenkevich. And even now Chukovsky's translation is the most popular, despite the presence of other translations. Naturally, such a popular children's novel could not escape the attention of Soviet directors, and 3 films (there is also a funny cartoon from 1988, but it's not about it here) based on this novel were shot in the USSR at different times, and they were all different in spirit. All the films were called the same as the novel.

1. The 1937 film directed by Vladimir Vajnshtok, music by Nikita Bogoslovsky. In accordance with the party line, the motive of the national liberation movement was introduced into the film. The positive heroes seek to get treasures not out of simple human greed, but to buy weapons for the Irish freedom fighters, and the rich man Trelawney becomes a pawnbroker, a traitor and just a bad person here, because capitalists cannot be good people (in fairness, image Trelawney is also often denigrated in Western adaptations). The guy Jim was replaced by a girl Jenny, in love with Dr. Livesey, who disguised herself as a boy in the plot, and John Silver has both legs, but one has shrunk and is shorter than the second, and Ben Gunn dies here. Also, here the names of some characters are transmitted incorrectly. The film was restored twice (in 1960 and 1983): edited and re-recorded. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A](https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A)
2. The 1971 film directed by Evgeny Fridman. Music by Alexey Rybnikov. In the role of Silver — Boris Andreev, in the role of Jim — Aare Laanemets. Another film adaptation, this time with the involvement of Baltic actors. An almost perfect film adaptation — for some miserable hour and twenty-two minutes, the novel was transmitted almost verbatim! There are, however, minimal changes: navigator Billy Bones, instead of boozing like hell, led a healthy lifestyle and didn't die of a heart attack, but under the bullets of former comrades, alone defending the «Admiral Benbow» tavern; there is no Black Dog; there is no scene when Ben Gunn trolled pirates, shouting the catchphrases of Captain Flint. In all other respects, the film follows the novel as closely as possible, and the short timing does not interfere with this at all. Probably, the reason for this is the filigree, verified work of the director: not a single extra frame. There are also eight songs in the film and there is a very sinister Blind Pew. For this film, the fishing sailing-diesel schooner «Klim Voroshilov» was rebuilt into the brigantine «Hispaniola». The vessel was later used in the films «Mermaid Shoals» and «The Life and Amazing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe» (1972, directed by Stanislav Govorukhin). The ship is installed on the Yalta embankment as a restaurant, now it is one of the symbols of the resort. Disputes about which version is better — this one or Vorobyov's mini-series, which will be discussed below — break out every now and then on Russian forums of movie lovers. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI](https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI)
3. 3-serial TV movie of 1982 directed by Vladimir Vorobyov. In the role of Silver — Oleg Borisov, in the role of Jim — Fedya Stukov, previously famous for the role of Tom Sawyer in 1981 film. There are 3 versions of the film — 220 minutes, 194 minutes and 183 minutes. The initial version was 4 episodes of 55 minutes each. In the 1980s, the film was censored twice and became a three-part series. Scenes of violence, gambling, images of dead bodies, especially scary moments were removed from it, taking into account the children's audience of the film. After the first edition, the scenes disappeared: a close-up of the face of Blind Pew with a cork instead of an eye (""and now, boy, take me to the captain!""); Dr. Livesey makes bloodletting to Billy Bones, Jim holds a basin into which blood begins to drip, the doctor's conversation with Billy Bones (see in the book); Dr. Livesey talks about the personalities of the pioneer pirates (Squire's estate); squire's comment on the identity of the pirate killed by Redruth and fell off a cliff in the scene of relocation to the fort. After the second edition, the scenes disappeared: Billy Bones tells a scary story, at this time an owl flies through the room and scares the guests; Jim Hawkins' dream, where John Silver appears for the first time; a drunk Billy Bones descends the stairs and expels two guests from the table; Billy Bones sees Flint in the corner and begs Jim for rum; Blind Pugh's pursuit of Jim along the coast, Jim falls, entangled in a net, Blind Pew pulls his hands to him; Billy Bones' death (falls from the stairs, grabbing a fishing net); Jim searches Bones' body for a key, a hamster crawls along Bones' neck; Hands and O'Brien play cards ""on knives"" (Squire's arrival in Bristol); Hands and O'Brien play cards in the cabin of the ship (Squire: ""I was shut down!""); Squire Trelawny in the cabin of the Hispaniola makes a toast to Jim's health; Hunter found a skeleton under a blanket in the fort (""Dr. Livesey's reconnaissance""); Hunter's corpse torn by a bomb after storming the fort; carpenter Abraham Gray gives Jim a gun; the beginning of a card game on the Hispaniola between Israel Hands and O'Brien, when each of them holds a card in his mouth; Jim brings a bottle of brandy to Hands: ""Thank you. Cheers, Captain!""; Silver in the fort sips from a bottle: ""Do you want a drink? I'll take a sip. And then there is still so much trouble ahead""; Silver examines the black mark and asks about who gave the paper for it: ""Who gave his Bible for such blasphemy?""; Silver ask about the cut-up bible of Dick Pastor: ""Maybe it is still suitable for communion?"" — ""The Bible?"" With a torn page?"". The most famous is the last, shortest version of the film, which is why many perceive this film as a musical children's film, although, as you can see, the film was originally quite creepy, with notes of black comedy. In the late 90s, the company ""Крупный план"" released a videotape with a little-affected second version. The original version of the film is currently unavailable. Also, the film has noticeably deviated from the original source: Fedya is too small for the role of Jim, and plays some kind of tomboy pioneer instead and the involvement of a nine-year-old boy in the main role contradicts the main motive of the novel — the formation of a teenager's personality (although Jim's age is not specified in the novel, but his psychology corresponds to a boy aged 12-13 years, or in extreme cases 14-15); Silver turned from a tall, exceptionally strong man into a dry, pale, nondescript old man, similar to a physics teacher from high school (however, there is an alternative opinion that this is a brilliant non-canon: he seems homely, but in fuct he a sinister gray cardinal, taking coolness and intelligence. He boasts that Flint himself was afraid of him, in the voice of a Soviet engineer proud of being awarded a prize… But he manages to grab a pistol faster than others, and crushing the spine of a hefty sailor with a blow of a crutch is easy for him. According to the actor, such an image is an evil satire on domestic elderly experienced ""thieves in law"" who feel like the rulers of fate); Ben Gunn armed himself with a blowpipe with nerve poison and killed Silver, allegedly by accident; Billy Bones, performed by Leonid Markov, is rather an anti-villain, sincerely tired of the bloody pirate freedom and looking for a quiet and peaceful place to live, even his catchphrase about whether to leave witnesses alive (""The dead don't bite""), handed over to Captain Flint; also, the prologue (before arriving in Bristol) is stretched out for the whole 45 minutes due to the hamsters, owls and shells, quotes from other works of Stevenson and theatrically slow dialogues.

Their costs, while very moderate for a film company, (5 million and 9 million), is actually really huge for a single person. M Night had to refinance his house or some shit to pay for The Visit.

Now those films are box office hits. They grossed 100 mil and 280 mil respectively, but as I know it, he had to find a buyer for the film, find distribution, and no doubt paramount pictures or walt disney or whatever probably took a huge chunk of the profits.

My question is, on a very, very, rough estimate, how much money would you say M Night made from The Visit and Split, given that he had to finance it all himself?

For reference:

Split- costs: 9 million, box office: 280 million
The Visit- costs: 5 million, box office: 100 million.",1644411158.0
socunz,"Iconic moments, props, costumes, scenes etc. in recent movies?",0,0.4,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/socunz/iconic_moments_props_costumes_scenes_etc_in/,25,"Can anyone think of anything from recent movies (let's say the last 10 years) that are original and yet also have that iconic feel of something like the look of Indianna Jones, or the Delorean from *Back to the Future*, or the Xenomorph from *Alien* and the Predator from *Predator*? Or even scenes, like the shower scene in *Psycho*, the opening scene of *Jaws*, or Darth Vader's famous line in *Empire Strikes Back*?

I don't really think superheroes can count as being iconic in and of themselves, because they were arguably iconic *before* their respective franchises, etc.  But I will concede something like the shot of all the Avengers together in New York at the end of *The Avengers* probably fits the bill, because it's something that was born entirely out of the film and is recognisable and therefore somewhat iconic for most people at this point.

I'm struggling to think of anything.

EDIT - I guess I didn't explain my logic with regards to the MCU/superheroes too well, because people keep arguing with me about them. I'm not saying those things aren't iconic, quite the opposite. But they're a given, in the same *Star Wars* is a given, or Bond is a given, etc. These things are massive existing franchises that became iconic long over 10 years ago, and as such are building upon a huge pre-existing audience or off of previously established ideas within the franchise itself.

Also, this isn't meant to be a slight on the quality or merit of these franchises, just that if we didn't rule them out the whole thread would just be people saying ""The Infinity Gaunlet"" or ""Lightsabres"" or whatever. I hope that clarifies. Sorry I wasn't clearer to begin with.",1644411109.0

I thoroughly enjoy the movie and think it's very well done, but I struggle with my enjoyment of the source material (which I equally, if not more, enjoy) and this telling on the focus of evidence vs motive. I struggle because the message is different, when focused on evidence it is merely a mystery, however when focused on the people it is a story played out that can be experienced, no reader thinks themselves Poirot, but they find a different character among the suspects.

so2zrc,My Idea For A Scifi Trilogy,0,0.35,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so2zrc/my_idea_for_a_scifi_trilogy/,8,"I dream of becoming a filmmaker and focus on practical effects, and Star Wars is a huge inspiration for me to want to make films. If I made my own space opera film, it would be a small group of space mercenaries flying around in a Millennium Falcon inspired freighter. They would be known as The Marauders. This franchise would also have a big toyline featured many action figures, vehicles, and a few playsets. The titles of these films would be:

The Marauders 

The Mauraders: Shadows of Warfare 

The Marauders: Unifying Force

The Maruaders members would consist of a flame thrower specialist named Kyle Savo, a talented teenage engineer and medic named Emily Veronis, an elite sniper named Bryce Kiness, a heavy weapons expert named Amadeus Xizor.

Kyle Savo worked for the evil Zeta Empire and was a flame trooper that went rogue (kinda like Finn from the sequels). He steals an experimental suit of advanced armor with a built in heat beam canon. He is a psychopath that loves jazz, much like Io Flemming from Gundam Thunderbolt.

Emily Veronis was an orphaned child who had her planet conquered and she was tortured and experimented on by the Zeta Empire. They eventually tampered with her genetic make up with a highly intelligent alien species, which caused her mutate and gain some physical characteristics of that species as well as some new abilities, most notably super intelligence. She used this to her advantage to escape and stop the mutation from spreading. With her intelligence she crafts many advanced and complex technologies and is immensely knowledgeable with medicine and machinery. She is agile, however she is physically weak. She also struggles with self acceptance after what she has experienced. 

Bryce Kiness is the leader of the group and captain of the the freighter. He is doesn't like to go guns and blazes when he isn't  flying his ship, and has a calm and humble personality. He is a former bounty hunter for the Republic but quit after realizing after all fo the horrible atrocities they have committed.

Amadeus Xizor worked with Bryce as a bounty hunter and copilot. He is a trigger happy individual and gets angry very easily. However deep inside he really cares for his allies.

As for the politics, the galaxy's core government is a republic similiar to Star Wars. Decades before the events of the Maruaders Trilogy, the Zeta Empire waged war in hopes of conquering the entire galaxy. The empire was defeated, but they were given a decent amount of the galaxy to rule for themselves. A few years before the events of the first Mauraders movie the Republic gets more and more paranoid of the empire that they start committing violent atrocities to their planets in order to maintain control.

Meanwhile, the Empire has been preparing for another war in their area and started to rely on Red Abyss, a criminal organization with the most advanced technology in the galaxy, lead by the crim lord Kannos Zenith. Seeing how the galaxy's republic is in turmoil they use this chance to strike with sheer force, capturing some planets in the process. There are no good guys or bad guys in the story, just two horribly corrupt governments. The Maruaders are hired for the Republic but as they go through and adventures, they see that both sides are corrupt, they realize war is a gray area. 

Towards the end of the trilogy, The Marauders find out that Red Abyss is giving supplies to the Republic as well, and at this point Red Abyss becomes so powerful that they betray both the Zeta Empire and the Republic with their incredible weapons and technology far more advanced than the Zeta Empire or the Republic. The two governments make the difficult decision to join forces and take out this greater evil in a final battle on the Red Abyss's home planet, with The Maruader leading the operation. As the fleets of the Zeta Empire, Republic, and Red Abyss rip each other to shreds, The Mauraiders raid the Red Abyss headquarters and have an intense final battle with the Kannos who is armed to the teeth to take on the heroes.

After the battle, the war comes to a close, and the Zeta Empire and Republic merge into a Galactic Federation in order to maintain peace. The Maruaders decide to live together aboard their freighter, and together they become ambassadors of the Federation.

I saw movies which are racist or sexist or homophobic - but I think this is the first time that a film manages to be excellent in all of these categories.

Seriously, this movie tries it's very best to show a world with as many ways to put people into  categories as possible. ""Fag"" and ""faggot"" are common language, there are supposed-to-be-funny rants about a chinese exchange student who is ALWAYS introduced with a loud gong sound when shown (like wtf). Stupid Molly Ringwald is all whining about not getting laid but at the same is right on a bitch to a guy who wants the same, and we are supposed to identify with her? Sure, 16 years olds mostly just want to get laid but this movie cherishes this superficial way of thinking instead of saying like ""Look how stupid we were as teens"". Hell, it even ends with a passed out girl who is traded by his boyfriend against a pair of underwear so the horny ""geek"" can sleep-creep (aka rape) her - that's seriously how it is!

I can't even believe I'm writing a rant post - especially after Ringwald herself spoke out against the film ([https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink)).

Being the first sequel (or requel) in 10 years I figured something was going to tie from the original and cap it off. 

That something was Stu from the first film and boy did Scream 5 set that up only to not do it. Stu returning fits with the original scrapped sequel idea of him having new killers under him while jailed and it fits with what a long returning sequel or end film would do. Instead it looks like we are just getting Scream 6.

5 did so much stuff you would do in a last film except having the last final big moment. Meta statement on original returning, Billy's daughter and the hallucinations, Stu's house being the last location, the death of a legacy character, and Gales refusal to write anymore about the crimes. Dewey dieing to Stu or atleast because of Stu is way better and Gale possibly stopping future killers with not sensationalizing it is a great way to put an end on the series and yet its not the end.

All we needed was Stu to be mentoring the two psychos, face off with Sydney, and die with others not being written about. Great ending! And I really thought he was gonna pop out until the very end.

If six is our end (which it basically has to be) I feel like they wasted so much good end game stuff. 

The only avenue I see left is to dive into the idea of a series getting old and no one caring anymore, which could act as an end. But it of course needs old Sydney and Stu.

Even describing the plot is just absolutely insane. Mrs Robinson seduces a college graduate, has an affair with him, restricts him from seeing her daughter, arranges a marriage to stop Ben from seeing her daughter, and in the end gets locked inside a church while her daughter and Ben do whatever they want for the year and a half before they get divorced.

I watched the first half (up to the stripper date) last night and watched the second half today. And they are basically two completely different films. The first half is Ben and Mrs. Robinson’s story, and the second is Elaine and Ben’s story. And another thing I loved is how the characters completely changed within these two halves. Mrs. Robinson reveals her true self by forcing Elaine into a marriage and accusing Ben of being a rapist. Ben shows how awful he can be, by tormenting a girl on her first date and stalking her.

There is no protagonist. If you forced me to pick one, probably Elaine, but that’s because she ends up looking the best. Ben and especially Mrs. Robinson have shown how despicable they are, and it’s great that this movie tries to tackle this for a movie that was made 55 years ago.

Loved the first fifteen minutes due to how fast-paced it was. Loved Ben breaking into the Robinson housefor how fast-paced it was.

However, this movie does have some criticism from me, and that’s mainly due to the soundtrack. They play the same two songs THREE TIMES EACH. And they played the fair song like five minutes apart from each other, that’s just not enough room to breathe.

so0wc6,Analyzing Allison's Transformation in The Breakfast Club,36,0.72,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so0wc6/analyzing_allisons_transformation_in_the/,22,"First, a little disclaimer. I do not frequent this subreddit, but I wanted to make a post about this and I thought this would be the best place for it (if it isn't, please let me know). This is going to be a long post, with some discussion of (relevant) personal experiences so buckle up. The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies, Allison is my favorite character, and I relate to her a lot so I have a lot of thoughts about this topic. This also might be all over the place, so I apologize in advance for that. 

Now let's get into the actual topic. I've seen debates about [Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club](https://youtu.be/rprB-_jyLjU?t=60), with comments about how her makeover was out of character, made her look worse, and is just another example of a girl changing herself to get a guy. I understand the frustration and where these comments are coming from, but I think that is a very surface-level analysis of this scene and a disservice to Allison's character development in the movie. 

First of all, I think the makeover serves as a physical manifestation of her growth throughout the movie. At the beginning of the movie, she appears dressed in all dark colors, is fully covered, her hair covering her eyes, and her body language is very closed off. Her character is introverted, painfully shy, quiet, a little weird, and it is implied that she has little to no friends. 

But as she gets to know the rest of the group, as she forms relationships with them and starts to be able to show who she truly is, she begins to open up to them. She tells them about her personal struggles, about how she gets no attention at home and is a compulsive liar (which are important to her character but I'm not going to get into that in this post). She also becomes louder and brighter, inserts herself into conversations, and starts to take up space. 

Considering that, the makeover makes so much sense in her journey into learning who she is and how to form healthy relationships. She trades in her black long-sleeved jacket and shirt for a white, collared, short-sleeved blouse, puts makeup on, and lifts her hair out of her eyes with a white headband. She also carries herself with new confidence, she's still hesitant right after the makeover, but if you compare her first scene to her last scene, she no longer closes off herself from others and has more open body language.

Now if you think the makeover makes her look worse, that's a personal opinion but I honestly don't think it's relevant to this discussion. The makeover is about her growth and development, she's trying new things and she's getting more in touch with her feminity. As someone who has had a similar journey as Allison's, growing up I thought using makeup and wearing ""girly"" clothes was too much like ""other girls"". I too would wear baggy and dark clothes, simultaneously trying to distance myself from other girls while also trying to blend in with the wall and take up as little space as I could. As I have become more comfortable with my femininity, I've started wearing more makeup and dresses and skirts, but I also keep parts of my old wardrobe. Just like Allison, I still enjoy parts of my old style (""Hey I like that black shit""), but I also no longer demonize anything related to femininity. Teenagehood is the best time to try new styles and figure out who you are, so Allison's makeover is just an extension of her experimentation and her willingness to try something new and stand out to others. Her style at the beginning of the movie was expertly crafted to make her unnoticeable yet different from other girls, which goes hand in hand with her initial characterization and background, and her makeover is a natural progression of her development and what she learned throughout the movie. 

Finally, the makeover also shows her relationship with the other characters in the movie. I think the dialogue between Claire and Allison in this scene especially shows Allison's growth. Allison asks Claire, ""Why are you being so nice to me?"" and Claire responds with ""Because you're letting me."" Now, this is more of my personal analysis, but this shows how Allison is learning to form relationships with others. This dialogue shows how Allison thought that others (especially the popular kids) wouldn't be nice to her, and that stopped her from forming relationships. But here Allison learns that Claire and the popular kids would show her kindness if she let herself get to know them and bond with them (at least as Claire says). I know this feeling, there's a voice in your head that is telling you that no one would ever want to be friends with you so don't even try it, which I think is probably what Allison experienced as well. 

As for Allison's relationship with Andy, I don't think she ever changed herself for him. As I've said the makeover was to display her character growth, and Andy showed interest in her long before this scene. Additionally, his reaction is not the only important one. Yes, she is obviously most nervous to show him her transformation, but she also puts weight into Claire's and Brian's reactions as well and gets confidence from their positive responses. I see the reactions of the people around her more as support and acceptance of her trying new things and becoming brighter, rather than the reason for her transformation. 

TLDR: Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club is a representation of her character growth throughout the movie, and how she learned to take up space, form close relationships, and that performing femininity isn't a curse. I adore her as a character and I think those who say this scene ruined her characterization are misguided.

Okay, I did deliver on the long post. Overall, I think the makeover is a very misunderstood scene, and Allison as a character is also very misunderstood. I'm sorry if I didn't make any sense, I just wanted to share my opinion about this. Thank you so much for reading this post, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this scene if you've made it this far!",1644370227.0

Ropes snapping and slicing through flesh, barrels splashing and sliding over decks and rigs, dynamite and gas cylinders, close attention to the inner workings of trains and boats and mines and oil rigs. In ""Jaws"" this ""mechanical"" horror is often more effective than the ""biological"" horror of the shark, IMO. 

I'm not sure if I'm making sense but this depiction of raw, senseless, dehumanising physical forces across the two films was really cool to compare. Things like the beach scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are similar but, y'know, that's explicitly a war film where brutality is expected. Both ""TWBB"" and ""Jaws"" are of course brutal, but in quite a different way from violent war films. Likewise, intentional ""mechanical horror"" like ""Tetsuo: Iron Man"" is tasteless by comparison.

I think that they should give a digital copy (or a big discount for the physical/digital) when it's out of the ""billboard""  for everyone who has watched on the cinema. It won't affect the physicial media revenue as it's a different business focused on collectors and so on.

FYI: the common rice of single movie on the cinema in any normal theatre (not IMAX) is 9€. Only some cinemas give  Monday to thursday  40% discount.

P.d: Not IMAX but releated, the movie Licorice pizza it's only on selected cinemas so they ask 11.50€ for a ticket.

I think this is an almost great B-Movie, I think the 3D part was gilding the lilly, wholly unnecessary if not distracting, the flick stands alone without it.

The stand-out here is William Fichtner, he just nails it as the Accountant. The rest of the cast is fine, Nic Cage is Nic Cage. Amber Heard doesn't add much (Rosie O'Donnell would of been more interesting), and Charlotte Ross has a hilarious set piece (where is she these days?). The writing overall is excellent, but Fichtner's performance is the stand-out here, makes the movie.

I can't deny how much I like this movie and I praise it for Whannell's directing style especially with his use of colors and darkness in Invisible Man. I know Whannell is probably known better for horror movies such as Insidious and Saw, but I was surprised to learn that Upgrade was getting a TV series and that he was directing a reboot for Escape from New York. I'm currently wondering when is Upgrade's TV show gonna air because I'm curious to see what direction Whannell goes in for this.

As a Whannell fan, I've been wondering if he would do some more action movies like James Wan. I would love to see him work with franchises such as Jump Street, Jason Bourne, Fast and Furious. Although I wonder if this could limit his creativity in contrast to Wan's considering the fact Wan not only worked and co created Insidious and Saw with him, but also helmed Furious 7 and Aquaman. Regardless of franchise or independent work, I was just wondering how do most of you feel about Whannell as an action director especially concerning Upgrade? I personally see Upgrade as an underrated movie that should have opened more doors for Whannell and even liked it more than Deadpool 2 despite the post being about Whannell as an action filmmaker.",1644364474.0

The experience of watching this film and my feelings on it since are really unlike most any other film I’ve seen the more I think about it.

I pretty much saw it cold, going in. I knew Frances Mcdormand was in it ( who I love) but that was about it.

Throughout watching the film, I’d be lying if I said I was enjoying it, yet was still completely engrossed. I think mainly not knowing the premise or anything about the film and filmmaker it left me openly worried about where the film was heading. Frances’ character felt like at any moment the hammer was going to drop and something horrific was going to happen to her. The suspense of her safety was constantly in play, and I was expecting robbery or even murder at any given moment.

However once the film played out we are given the films overall thesis, the fact that out of all of this strife and hardship that ultimately this was all Frances choice. She chooses this lifestyle and that was a little bit of a sigh of relief knowing she wants this life and not being simply submitted to it out of hardship.

What stuck with me after watching this film was how intellectually honest it managed to be. The film never felt like it was trying to manipulate me into a specific POV, nor did it stoop to cliches or tropes it so easily could have ( nice stranger who turns out to be evil, accosting teenagers and the like) the film was simply confident in its narrative and just sort of goes with it, it doesn’t force anything narratively or any message down our throats. It just IS. 

For that reason that reason the film really stuck with me. I find it so interesting and unique that I almost didn’t enjoy the film while watching it but enjoyed it so much more after the fact.",1644364138.0

Why?

First off, why wouldn't he say, ""She is alive"" if he is implying that Eloise will see her, or that ""She the one who killed"", based on the fact that he views that house as ""hell"", which I'm assuming has to do with the possibility that he investigated the murders/disappearance of the men.

More importantly, why would he imply Alex killed Sandy? Eloise can see ghosts, but I felt like it's such a stretch to include the ghost of Sandy, who is a metaphor for the countless ""deaths"" she endured, let alone that the detective (who the only show them speaking once), also understands the metaphorical deaths of Sandy?

The entire movie is based on th facts that she can see/become ghost/travel in time (I actually don't know) and the ghost she sees, isn't actually dead (also, why the false vision when everything else was real?).

Personally, I would have had it so the viewer thought they were seeing the ghost of Sandys life up until her ""death"", where Eloise would wake up and be to afraid to sleep in the house to see the end of the murder. Eventually she would return, which would then reveal that Sandy was alive and was actually seeing through the eyes of Jack, who wants revenge for his murder.

 Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called ""Wayne's World"" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of ""Wayne's World""—and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast—as well as the wild pop-culture references—make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie.

This peaked my curiosity as the same site claimed the film is from Ukraine and Cyprus, two countries I don't often associate with Disney pictures.

So I started looking into it. ""The team"" meaning the producers? No. The writers? No. Neither the director or none of the actors had anything to do with the films either. So I started going through the list of the crew, it turns out this is the first project of almost everyone involved and there certainly isn't a team of people who had been the creative forces alongside Disney legends Clements and Musker to create Moana.

Except for one person that is, animation director [Tony Bonilla](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2254101/) who previously had worked as an animator on those films and some other big ones.

His casting felt a little off to me? Like the character was written as a more ""smooth, charismatic figure"" yet he was still doing his abrasive shtick? Like he sounded less like he was genuinely excited about all the marketing opportunities the fake war could bring and more like he was pretending to be excited but was about to strangle DeNiro and Hoffman?

I don't know, it felt more like a character Robert Downey Jr. or Eddie Murphy should be playing than Denis Leary.

It didn't really matter, though, because everyone else was cast well, especially Willie Nelson in the same scene. And Leary did play a macho news producer in a similar political satire, The Second Civil War, the same year. And he was great in that and it was also a more fitting character for him in my opinion.",1644356399.0

snvcoq,What is/are your favorite cinematography scene(s)?,20,0.71,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snvcoq/what_isare_your_favorite_cinematography_scenes/,32,"For me it has to be the following moments:

- The [match cut in Lawrence of Arabia](https://youtu.be/0ccB1KTzr9o).

This match cut in the beginning is one of the most impactful cuts i’ve seen in a film. The cut went from a close-up shot of something (T.E. lawrence and the match), to a wide-shot of nothing (the sun and open desert). This creates a composition contrast, but remains interlinked through the absence of a color contrast, because we went from the orange match to the orange desert.

In the first shot we see that T.E. Lawrence has power and control over the heat, because he blows out the match. In the next shot we see that the heat has the power and control, because we see a rising sun over an endless desert. This creates an emotional and physical contrast between T.E. Lawrence and his admiration for the desert.

- The [composition shots in Eyes Wide Shut](https://youtu.be/MIdNBBTBuqM)

These shots are really powerful to me and I can’t get these images out of my head. The shots visualize multiple strong emotions, while maintaining a static image. The camera doesn’t move, the people don’t move and the masks don’t have movement in the facial expressions.

This results in a minimalistic image, which causes the focus to go to the compositions of the characters and the emotions on the masks.


- The [match cut in 2001: A Space Odyssey](https://youtu.be/xkNV_wALoYc)

This match cut is also one of the best I’ve seen in a film. This cut visualizes a jump of 3 million years in just a couple seconds. In the first shot we see a bone that the man-apes used as a weapon to kill eachother. In the next shot we see a nuclear weapon in space that humans could use to kill eachother.

The motion, rotation and location between the bone and nuclear weapon don’t exactly allign during the match cut, causing it to not change smoothly. I interpret this as a visualization to show that evolution within the 3 million years isn’t a smooth process as well.",1644355636.0

The cinematography from Claudia Becerril Bulos is especially amazing; with lots of landscape photography and an amazing use of depth of field. As the movie progresses, the cinematography and general presentation gets more surreal.

The story primarily deals with the horror that the cartel has been inflicting on Mexico with a focus on the violence in the borderlands.

But you know, you don't watch musicals for tight plotlines and credible characters.

Still, we started thinking of all the musicals we know, and we couldn't find a single one that had a credible, sound, and interesting plot, despite most of them being pretty enjoyable.

Grease has an incredibly dumb story, Moulin Rouge was heartbreaking when I was a teenager, now it's cringey and stupid. Rocky Horror, well, that movie kinda strives on the absurdity of the story, so... And I love all three of those musicals, mind you.

I was very surprised by the low scores the movie received on Rotten Tomatoes and Audience scores. (56% and 78% respectively)  I love satire.  It’s one of my favorite types of movies and books , and I love when juxtaposition is utilized.    Some writers say: “wow them in the end” and this movie really hit home in its last line: “We Had Everything”.    Which is so true of today: we have smart phone (well smart everything). Families can be who they want.  We have freedom to choose our paths in life.  And the movie taught us to look at the smaller thing we take for granted— Albeit an old lesson but it’s one we tend to forget and need reminders for.  And this movie did just that.  “We had coffee” .  It was kinda a perfect way to end that scene and the movie overall. .  It was warm and heartfelt; the line was delivered perfectly by our lead.  Which is why I’m dumbfounded by the low scores.    Why do you think the movie wasn’t received well by critics and the general population.      


I do have a theory about the critics:   Critics hate to be preached to.  And maybe the movie did a bit too much preaching.   But this simple lesson of appreciating what we have is always a good lesson to preach about.",1644337621.0

Personally, I don't think award shows are worth the time as most of the films nominated are based more on popularity than overall quality.  With todays nominees for best animated, Mamoru Hosoda's 'Belle' didn't get a nomination. Most of noms for that catagory are Disney/Pixar.

Below is the original post with updates in **bold** (except for the headings) Here was the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/r6pcv0/last_january_my_friends_and_i_picked_the_best/) just so you can see we didn't cheat ;)


We love movies and thought it would be fun to look back on our picks once the official noms come out. Stumbled upon the word doc last week and wanted to see how our predictions were holding up so far and I thought this community might enjoy it. 

We *only* looked at the name of the film, the cast/director attached at the time, the studio, and one to two sentences about the plot. It's interesting seeing how off we were on some and how we actually weren't too wrong on some others. I also included some data from the last 27 years of Best Picture winners: RT critic score, RT audience score, and the average of those two numbers to compare to how the films are looking compared to past winners.

For those interested in the historical info from Forrest Gump to Nomadland:

The average RT critic score over the past 27 films has been **88.2%**, the audience score **86.3%**, with the average of those two numbers being **87.3%**. I used those numbers as a loose talking point when discussing how I think a movie might do in the Best Picture nom race. 

Just for shits and gigs, the lowest rated critic scored film to win Best Picture in the last 27 years was *Forrest Gump* with a rough 71% critic score. But it made up for it with a resounding 95% audience score to average out to 83%. Still decently below the average of all Best Picture winners, but still higher than some other winners (Braveheart 82%, Gladiator 82%, Crash 81%, and the Shape of Water 82%).

The lowest rated audience scored film to win Best Picture in the same time frame was *Titanic* with 69% audience score, *nice*. It landed at 89% with critics to put it at an average of 79% (if you trust the RT numbers on slightly dated films). If you believe the numbers, this is the ""worst"" Best Picture winner in the last 27 years.


# Ok now on to the post


We divided our picks into 3 categories:

* **Surely to get consideration**

* **Might get some strong looks**

* **Dark Horses**

# Surely to get consideration

* *Cantebury Glass* (New Regency) delayed to 2022: We didn't even know the plot to this one, but it had Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Robert De Niro, Timothy Olyphant, Rami Malek, and even the great Mike Myers signed on with Oscar winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Birdman, Children of Men, the Revenant, Gravity). Sounded like a Best Picture recipe to us. Unfortunately, the film has been pushed back to a 2022 release so we'll have to wait a bit to see if this one delivers.

* *The French Dispatch* (Searchlight Pictures) 74% critic, 76% audience, 75% average: Looking back on our list, we were really hot on Searchlight for some reason as this is the first of four films from the studio we would list. A Wes Anderson film with Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, and Timothee Chalamet. Seemed like it could be one to sneak in with some solid reviews and snag a nom. Unfortunately it underperformed and doesn't seem like it's in the running for a nom. I think we got a little too excited with the cast and thought Anderson may pull out the Isle of Dogs (90% critics, 87% audience) and Grand Budapest Hotel (92% critic, 86% audience) magic, but sadly it was not the case.

+ *House of Gucci* (UA) 62% critic, 83% audience, 72.5% average: lol. We got baited so hard by this one. Good director, great cast, interesting plot/setting. This film had crazy potential on paper. It would be the lowest rated critic and average score to win Best Picture if it somehow did, but I don't think it will get a nom at this point.

+ *Nightmare Alley* **Ayyy got one right!** (Searchlight) releasing in theaters 12/17: One guy in our group was a big del Toro fan and the cast was surprisingly heavy. Plot sounded just ""OK"" but it was early and there wasn't much detail out there. This one has a shot at nom, but what worries me is that we are a couple weeks out from release and have yet to see any reviews from advanced screenings. Macbeth is even further out and we are already getting glowing reviews coming in from early screenings. This film not being shown off early is a little concerning to me honestly, and I won't be shocked if it has a mild release and misses a nom.

+ *The Tragedy of Macbeth* **This one seems like the closest thing to a snub this season** (A24) 98% critic, releasing 12/25: Speaking of Macbeth, this was a no brainer back at the start of the year. Joel Coen, Denzel Washington (darling), Frances McDormand (darling), with an epic story. This was one of the easiest ones to add to the list and there as pretty much no debate among our group at all. Early reviews are crushing it. If the audience reviews are even remotely decent (82%+ range) I think this one is a lock for a Best Picture nom.

+ *West Side Story* **We got lucky and picked the right musical this year** (20th Century) releasing 12/10: Spielberg remaking an all-time classic musical in a time when musicals are the hottest they've been in several decades. Wasn't much more to say. A little worried that official reviews aren't out yet on a movie that releases in 9 days, but we'll see. There are some tweets from an early showing that are being thrown around, but early tweets are almost always promotional gumbly goo. If it lands on solid footing, it may have to compete with *In the Heights*, which had a very strong showing (but more on that later), for a Best Picture nom. At the start of the year we were confident it would be this one, but we may have it reversed.

+ *C'mon, C'mon* (A24) 95% critic, 83% audience, 89% average: We initially picked this one based on the Joaquin and A24 pairing combined with, what we thought, was an Oscar-baiting premise. Turns out we might have been right. Movie is crushing it with critics and doing solid with audiences too. It's falling in close to that ""winner"" range of scores that we've seen in the past, so I'm still expecting a nom for this one.

+ *Dune* **Not too shabby** (Warner Bros) 83% critic, 90% audience, 86.5% average: Our group had a pretty decent love of sci-fi and fantasy so we were really hoping this one lived up to the hype. It was kind of a roll of the dice when we were discussing this. It was back early in the year so there wasn't even a full trailer yet, just lots and lots of hype. We thought it would either bust or blow it wide open. Turns out it kind of landed in the middle. The audience score is really strong and is higher than that of many past winners, might not be enough though in a year with some solid candidates. It still might get a Best Picture nom (it will surely get them in other categories), but I'm not too optimistic on that. If the second one delivers on all the payoff that the first film has setup, it's possible we see a Lord of the Rings situation where the sequel ends up catching all the praise for the whole series and Dune 2 could walk away big.

+ *The Last duel* **I think the bad press and the release timing screwed this one** (20th Century) 85% critic, 81% audience, 83% average: At first glance this seemed like a no-brainer. Great cast, director, and premise. For whatever reason it just didn't pan out and now it's sitting with below average scores for a Best Picture winner and lots of bad press due to comments from the Director. I can still see it snagging a nom just because of the cast and director, but I would be utterly disappointed if it won.

# Might get some strong looks

These were our presumed 2nd tier contenders. Probably weren't going to snag a nom unless some films in the top tier goofed up (and they did). It's also the category we were off the most on.

+ *Annette* (Amazon) 71% critic, 76% audience, 73.5% average: We thought Amazon might return to their Sound of Metal and Manchester by the Sea glory, and hell if Casey Affleck could lead them to nom than surely Adam Driver could. That was the basis of our discussion. at least. We missed the mark on this one big. No nom in sight for this one sadly.

+ *Blonde* (Netflix) Delayed to 2022: A Marilyn Monroe biopic with Ana de Armas and Adrien Brody. Had *potential* on paper and it felt just like the kind of movie Netflix could release that get some real critical praise. Add in being produced by Brad Pitt and we thought we would have a winner. Sadly we won't get to know until next year as it has been delayed. 

+ *The Eyes of Tammy Faye* (Searchlight) 66% critic, 87% audience, 76.5% average: Great cast with a really interesting premise that seemed like was a perfect storm to snag a nom. Unfortunately it just didn't pan out. Audiences liked it fine, but with reviews from critics like those it's unlikely to sniff a Best Picture nom.

+ *In the Heights* **Took a gamble on West Side Story over this one** (Warner Bros) 94% critic, 94% audience, 94% average: Believe it or not this one was actually hard to place for us. On one hand Lin-Manuel Miranda is super hot right now, and on the other hand it's a musical and we thought that people might have Hamilton fatigue and not give this one its due. We were way off. Destroying critic and audience reviews, this one should have been in the highest tier and it seems maybe only West Wide Story could keep it from snagging a Best Picture nom (solely because I don't see two musicals occupying Best Picture slots in the same year).

+ *Next Goal Wins* (Searchlight) Delayed to 2022: A comedy by Taika Waititi with Michael Fassbender, Rachel House, and Armie Hammer about the American Samoa futbol team suffering the worst loss ever (31-0). Seemed like it might slip into the Jojo Rabbit niche of films and snag a nom if the cards fell just right. Now that it's delayed and with all the Armie Hammer stuff out there it might not happen (and obv not this year).

+ *Stillwater* (Focus) 74% critic, 72% audience, 73% average: Matt Damon working with Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) on a unique story seemed like the type of film to sneak in a Best Picture nom. It just didn't hit all the right boxes with fans and critics alike and likely won't be getting a nom even though there's a little room at the top.

# The Dark Horses

These were films that we thought may surprise in a big way and make a run. Actually ended up being one of our stronger categories as it stands now.

+ *The Courier* (Lionsgate) 85% critic, 95% audience, 90% average: Benedict has been everywhere, and while we didn't have it pegged as a sure thing this film is looking like it's in a really strong place for a Best Picture nom. Respectable 85% from critics and a mega missile of an 95% audience score. If there's room at the top, pencil this one in as your Dark Horse. Might be too crowded to find room, but I think Courier has better odds than others on the list.

+ *King Richard* **Always feels good when a dark horse pops off** (Warner Bros) 91% critic, 98% audience, 94.5% average: I'm a huge tennis fan and was really the only one making a case for this film early on. Couldn't justify putting it any higher at the time; we just felt the Will Smith star power wasn't quite there anymore and were hesitant on people being interested in the Williams' story with wanning interest in Serena and Venus. But man this one landed fast and hard. Smith killed it, and this one is absolutely on track for a Best Picture nom. Can't even consider this one a Dark Horse anymore.

+ *Red, White, and Water* (A24) delayed to 2022: We threw this one in as a dark horse based on Jennifer Lawrence and the plot. A US soldier suffers a traumatic brain injury while fighting in Afghanistan and struggles to adjust to life back home. Probably going to be a bust....but just maybe co- nah, in hindsight this was probably a bad pick, but at least I can't say we were wrong since it's getting delayed until 2022 >:]

+ *Respect* (UA) 67% critic, 95% audience, 81% average: This was the kind of movie that, on paper, had potential to make a run if the cards fell right. The story of Aretha Franklin starring Jennifer Hudson and Forest Whitaker. Films about music icons are big right now, so it had a path to a nom. Things just didn't pan out, and though audiences loved it, it's likely not getting a Best Picture nom.

+ *Soggy Bottom* aka *Licorice Pizza*  **Two from this category, not too shabby** (UA) 92% critic, 98% audience, 95% audience: Undergoing a name change just a couple months ago, this film hit the ground running and is now a sure bet for a Best Picture nom. Paul Thomas Anderson with a coming of age film set in the 70's. It was enough to bait me into labeling it a dark horse back in January and it seems the bet paid off. 


# Films we absolutely missed 

+ *The Power of the Dog*  **Great film, probably our biggest miss** (Netflix) 95% critic, 77% audience, 86% average: Not sure why this wasn't on our radar. Maybe it wasn't on the list we looked at or maybe the name just led us astray and kept us from looking further into it because we thought it was dog or children's movie. Regardless, this film is making waves and I won't be surprised if it gets a best picture nom.

+ *Belfast*  **Another big miss** (Focus) 87% critic, 92% audience, 89.5% average: We weren't too hyped on this one when we saw it come up at the start of the year honestly. It didn't seem that exciting but it seems like it pulled a reverse Mank (which was enjoyed by critics but loathed by audiences with a 83% critic score and 59% audience score) and is getting solid praise across the board. Probably going to snag a Best Picture nom.

+ *Coda* **Wasn't on our radar, but truly an awesome movie** (Apple) 96% critic, 93% audience, 94.5% average: Holy smokes this one came out of nowhere to us. A relatively unknown cast and a director mostly known for her writing, Coda is getting incredible reviews from all sides and is likely snagging Apple a Best Picture nom.

+ *Tick, Tick... BOOM!* **Kind of falling in snub range to me now** (Netflix) 88% critic, 95% audience, 91.5% average: This one also caught us by surprise. Andrew Garfield taking the screen by storm. Directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the third possible musical that could snag a Best Picture nom. It's a tough year to be a musical competing for Oscars. Could Netflix end up with two of the Best Picture noms?


+ **Don't Look Up - Honestly not sure this deserves a nom, but here it is. Think some other films on the list were more deserving like Macbeth and Tick, Tick, Boom!**
+ **Drive My Car - Haven't seen nor heard much about it, so not surprising we missed on it. Will check it out soon though**


+ **Honestly it's kind of funny. We guessed (in some capacity) 5 of the 10 noms a year out based solely on the names attached to the projects. Not a terrible outcome if you're a gambler. Although a 50% is a failure pretty much everywhere you go. What do you guys think?**

So yeah we missed the mark on a couple and missed several completely but overall it was fun seeing how things shaped out based on the little info we had at the start of the year. Anything catch you guys by surprise? You have big whiff like we did?",1644331990.0

snllqd,I loved The treasure of the sierra madre,24,0.8,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snllqd/i_loved_the_treasure_of_the_sierra_madre/,10,"I was looking for a movie to watch, and landed on the 1948 classic the treasure of the sierra madre, directed by John Huston. the movie follows Fred C Dobbs, as played by Humphrey Bogart, and his search for gold in the Mexican mountains. He is accompanied by his friend  Curtin who he made while living rough in the streets of Mexico, and they are led in the expedition by the wise old adventurer Howard, played beautifully by the Director's father, Walter Huston. The movie is only on the surface about gold, and is more a study of what wealth and greed can drive a man to do. Despite the movie having being made more than seventy years ago, it still captured my attention with the wonderful acting and clever plot. just when you feel a plotline is dragging too long they change direction and keep you intrigued with an unexpected twist.  Fred Dobbs' character, brilliantly played by Humphrey Bogart, who bragged that gold would not change him, is probably how any of us would behave if we had the great fortune of winning the lottery, and it is the other two of the team who show their true colors. All in all, a tremendous film which I heard inspired Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood. Can anyone recommend similar old movies that capture your attention like this one did?",1644330653.0

What a Rollercoaster of a film. I feel like this movie isn't getting the love on Reddit it deserves.

Obviously the writing is on point, but for me there was an ""aha"" moment about halfway through the film that ties back into the title of the movie (I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but think of ""Moonfall"" as two words instead of one). Really smart stuff there, I enjoy when a director trusts his audience to connect the dots on their own.

I loved the symbolism in the film as well. It's subtle, but you can really see how Roland wanted to create an allegory for our modern times when our heroes are dodging asteroids in their Mercedes SUV (Who among us hasn't been there these last two years)

Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are in top form here with their back and forth banter. Just top notch banter. Can't say enough good things about their banter. I know its early in the year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar nod for one or both of them.

Anyways just wanted to post my thoughts on what's currently my MOTY. I'm looking forward to the 'accolades' trailer and eventual Criterion release.

I also remember and have seen the scene on YouTube and it only ever shows Ennis imagining that Jack was actually murdered by Homophobes during the phone call with jacks wife, and not the alternate scene that I'm remembering, which showed both horrific death scenarios. 
I've tried searching everywhere for this scene the way I remember it but can't find anything even remotely close to it, let alone a singular video of anyone dying this way. 
Did I make this scene up in my head? Is it a Mandala Effect?? Does anyone else specifically remember seeing him die both ways? 
My partner thinks I dreamt it up and the dream was realistic enough to make me think it actually happened in the movie, which isn't that far-fetched, but I don't think I would have been so traumatised by it had it just been a dream..

When you're dressing up those actors after the characters they play are dead, throw some white makeup on their faces so that they have that pale look.

I had 3 CD which had scenes like this:-

* Dennis nedry is getting killed by baby dinosaur (Jurassic park)

* Neo fighting against Smith clones (matrix reloaded)..... Tom & Jerry one

* Neo vs Mr Smith final (matrix revolutions)

I remember liking Neo vs smith clone fight scene a lot.... ( I was like 7/8)

I assumed those two neo fights were from the matrix 1999 .... and didn't know matrix had sequels

Neo was like superman/Goku to me back then

It seems there are many actors who were considered great and highly acclaimed at one time, but for whatever reason aren't as well remembered as some of their contemporaries. Two actors that come to mind are Paul Muni and Robert Donat. Both actors were similar to Daniel Day-Lewis due to the fact that both were academy award winning actors known for disappearing into their roles and considered the greatest actors from their time period. Both did not have a large filmography. Muni only did 23 films and Donat did only 20 films. 

Another example from later on was Montgomery Clift a great actor (with only 17 films) who seems to have suffered a similar fate since both Marlon Brando and James Dean (despite only starring in 3 films) appear more well known today than him. Clift was also considered the first true method actor to appear in films so it's kind of sad that actors who followed in his footsteps have eclipsed him.

 Both Muni and Donat are rarely mentioned or talked about even among classic film fans especially compared to their contemporaries like James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney. One would think their reputation and carefulness with selecting film roles would have been enough to keep their legacies thriving, but that didn't seem to be the case.

However, I am unable to find if there was directorial intention with using the Lambda Lambda Lambda Fraternity (a mostly Black American fraternity) as the segue in which the Nerds would eventually rise to stand up against their persecution.


We can even see in Gilbert and Lewis’s speech at the end of the film parallels being made between the hardships of Black Americans during the Civil Rights Movement and now the Nerds nearly 20 years later, and the African Americans are there to defend the Nerds because they are very much aware of the actual difficulty of persecution.


To summarize, I want to know if you think that this was an intentional directorial consideration to acknowledge real systemic issues in America, or if this just happens to be a compelling coincidence. It would be impressive if it was an intentional move, especially in an otherwise raunchy comedy classic.


Note: This post is not meant to compare to or minimize the hardships experienced by those in the Civil Rights Movement and those who still experience racial injustice today.

The “twist” was incredibly predictable and hardly even felt like a plot twist. It was more just new information we found out as the movie went on, there was no real build up or drama involved with it. 

The acting was pretty bad in my opinion. It was cheesy and awkward. I didn’t care about the characters and I really wasn’t interested to see how it ended up. The best way to describe the movie is bland and tired and I really wanted to like it.

PIXAR films are all usually juggernauts at the box office. They've also been around long enough to create huge nostalgia for older properties and are family affairs regardless if it's a sequel or not. Now how do you combine all these fantastical worlds together ala Endgame style? 

The Incredibles is the perfect lynch pin. It's a fantastical world with extraordinary heroes and ofcourse villains. It could easily span land, sea, and space. It could easily involve adults and children characters. It could bring in elements both big as a dinosaur to as small as an ant or the world of toys. Would it be outside of the realm of possibility to see them travel through not only time (past and future), but also alternate realities where Cars inhabit the earth? 

Creating a situation where all of these worlds need to be involved would be easy. The only question is who to choose from each franchise to be involved and how.

This film would be an absolutely huge epic. Every person on Earth would feel the need to see how this all plays out and they'd seek it on the biggest screen possible on opening weekend. I honestly think it would beat Endgame's opening weekend record out of the water. It would probably take up every single screen at a 30 screen multiplex to accommodate demand. It could make double what Avatar made. We're talking every man, woman, grandparent and child wanting to see this film. A child seeing Endgame, Avatar or Force Awakens could be debatable, but nothing would stop the tantrums they have if they're not taken to see the biggest kid's movie ever made.

Do they have to use EVERY Pixar movie? I could personally live without A Good Dinosaur or Brave, but I could easily see Merida joining the action. But otherwise, we're talking new sequels to some of the biggest franchises ever like Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, and Cars. And first-time sequels to movies like A Bug's Life, Up, Coco, Inside Out, Ratatouille, and Wall-E.

This would be the single biggest movie event in the history of film.",1644277790.0

Best Actor: I'd love if Rex, Phoenix, Cage, and Dinklage made it but none are happening now.

Best Actress: where to begin here? was Praying Stewart, Haim, and Reineve would all make it but only one likely will, in a very awesome world we'd see Comer, Rousseau, and Thompson all contending as well as Cruz.

Best Supporting Actor: hoping Cooper, Faist, Affleck, Leto, and Pacino much more over Hinds are five but most likely the last two might be our alone contenders, in a perfect awesome world would love to maybe have a Lindon nomination.

sn4at1,The Dead (2010) - Really well done & unique zombie movie,3,0.57,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sn4at1/the_dead_2010_really_well_done_unique_zombie_movie/,6,"“The Dead"" was really quite a surprise. And it is also a zombie movie way out of the ordinary; it is set in Africa, something you don't see every day. But if you have read David Wellington's ""Monster"" trilogy, then you will love this movie.

Let me say that the African setting was really a nice breath of fresh air in the zombie genre. It worked so well, because it was miles after miles of savanna and badlands. No big skyscrapers here, no high-tech underground facilities, no narrow and winding dark alleys. A couple of villages though, so it was cool.

However, one thing that puzzled me in ""The Dead"" was the amount of zombies that were shambling about in the savanna. I would have assumed that there wouldn't be that many walking around in the middle of nowhere. Near the villages, yes, but in the middle of the savanna, no! And oddly enough every time the two main characters in the movie stopped somewhere, there were suddenly (and always!) a group of zombies shambling in to attack them. That was so stupid. But I guess it was the simplest way to work in a heap of zombies into the story.

Basically the story revolves around two people only. But it works out well enough, despite the movie moving ahead at a fairly slow speed. But that was not a bad thing, because the movie was far from boring. Just don't expect speed, action and lots of adrenalin, though.

The cast in ""The Dead"" was nice and they did good jobs with their roles. And the two lead roles were well cast.

One thing that could have improved the movie for me, was if the zombies had glazed over milky eyes instead of those weird white eyes; it just didn't really make them have that classic zombie/dead person look. But hey, it was a minor thing. It is just me that pays attention to the small details.

All in all, ""The Dead"" was really a great movie and it was really nice to see this type of approach to the zombie genre. So thumbs up for the movie makers. And if you are a zombie aficionado like me, then you definitely want to check out ""The Dead"".",1644276111.0

I finally went and watched House of Gucci yesterday with a couple of friends.

Full background: I’m Italian, born and raised in northern Italy in the late 80s, then moved to Germany 10 years ago.

I don’t know if it was nostalgia but I LOVED the movie. From the very beginning when the waiter drops 5000 Lire of change to the accents and the constant switching between Italian and English.

The language: it doesn’t make any sense, I get it. But it’s so entertaining. Someone said that the accent is not correct. What do they mean? It’s a complete fantasy, of course no Italian would speak like that. Because they’d speak Italian! But it’s immensely entertaining. Especially coming from older great starts like Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons. Even Jared Leto, I loved every instant where he’s on screen.

Adam driver and lady Gaga are so good at what they’re doing that I completely fell into the love story and forgot that >!shes gonna kill him!<.

In the end Ridley Scott is a 84 years old director that makes movies like no other. And I deeply enjoy them (I loved The Last Duel as well)

The way most characters in The Hateful Eight refer to Marquis Warren is closer to how it would have been in real life back then, than how Ned Logan is treated in Unforgiven. Granted, he is whipped to death which was a fate more often suffered by blacks than any other group (which is why I suspect Peoples' original script may have been more realistic) but aside from that, not a single N-word, not a single objection from the prostitutes to giving him a ""free one"" and not a single indication that he is considered in any way differently to William Munny. He could have been played by Robert Duvall or Richard Crenna or Sean Connery and not a single line of dialogue would have had to change. This is not realistic. 

Eastwood has a history of giving very biased accounts of past events and characters, e.g. his deliberately miscast J. Edgar biopic where the director seems to hate Martin Luther King almost as much as Hoover did.

I'm not defending a kneejerk woke revision of history (there's nothing woke about Hateful Eight for instance) but Unforgiven was supposed to be particularly naturalistic and it consistently fails to be on a number of counts. It rings dishonest and shallow in a very quintaessentially Eastwoodian way.",1644268012.0

smzztd,(Spoilers) When Harry Met Sally Soundtrack on Prime,7,0.65,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smzztd/spoilers_when_harry_met_sally_soundtrack_on_prime/,4,"Hi guys. Has anyone had the opportunity to watch When Harry Met Sally on Amazon Prime? If you haven't, I really wouldn't bother. 

That's not a mark against When Harry Met Sally, either. This is truly one of the best films of all time. But for whatever reason, most probably licencing, the soundtrack to this film is altered on Amazon Prime. This may be the case on other streaming services, too. 

The most egregious case of this is the absence of Frank Sinatra's 'It Had To Be You' at the film's most pivotal moment between Harry and Sally. In its place is a jazz number, which might be enjoyable were it not for its terrible misuse here. This, please beware of spoilers here, is the famous scene of Harry confessing his love for Sally. 

I am totally struck by how much of an effect this change has when viewing with the knowledge of the original song. I'd be interested to see a person's emotional reaction to the scene whose first time seeing it is via Amazon, yet so far when recommending to friends I've been sure to steer them clear of the Amazon version. 

Why this change has been made, I do not know. Licencing seems the obvious answer, yet this confuses more; with the greatest of respect, the music of Frank Sinatra is widely heard in films ranging from the fantastic to the mediocre, high budget to low budget. Why one of the greatest films of all time, which arguably has the greatest use of Sinatra's music in all of cinema, would have to change its soundtrack in this way is beyond me. More baffling still is the completely uninspiring replacement. After looking it up I've seen very little commentary on this change, and certainly none from director Rob Reiner himself. I imagine, and have to believe, Reiner had no input on this decision. 

Anyways, has anyone else noticed this? Furthermore, does anyone know of any similar examples of soundtrack changes which completely alter the emotional impact of a scene/film?",1644265672.0

And it had some really hilarious scenes: for me, my favorites were: the opening funeral scene, the chimney scene, the auction, the restaurant scene, the scene with the cat and any scene with Christopher Walken had me in tears laughing, so funny. 

The scene >!where Ernie's in the chimney, Lars lights the match & it causes an explosion because the mouse took the plug out, the explosion sends Lars back in the drawer & sends Ernie halfway across the pond, then later when he gets out, they start communicating without saying any words, that entire scene never fails to make me laugh.

While my approach has been generally unhistorical since it is a made up fantasy world with its own society and customs, much of the **visual and societal influence on it has come from England and France circa 1300 and it is a dark fantasy interpretation of the black death and inquisition combined**. It is still a bit of a kitchen sink setting regardless.

There's been major influence going back and forward in time as some factions in the story do count with plate armour and longswords while others don't and I'm aware that that kind of equipment came later, more around the 15th to 16th century .

**What I'm looking for is inspiration both narrative and cultural, apart from set and costume design.**

I don't mind watching things that are a few hundred years off since it can still provide ideas for apparel design and architecture. The XIV cen. focus is only for getting an idea of what the culture was like.

Right now my list of what I intend to watch to take screenshots of and study includes

The Man in the Iron Mask (both 1998 and 1977, late 1600s France, still going to check it out for the castles and dungeons)

A Knight's Tale (2001, I know, still going to watch it)

Black Death (2010)

Excalibur (1981, this one likely is far in the past of the time period I'm interested in, if I'm not mistaken, though, but a quick glance through showed that it has plate armour even though the legend of Arthur places him around cen. VI? It's based on a XVI century play so maybe that's why) 

Henry V (1944 and 1989, also a bit modern in setting)

Joan of Arc (1948, The Trial of 1962, The Messenger 1999, the other 1999 one, The Passion of 1928, Joan the Maid 1 & 2 1994)

Kingdom of Heaven (director's cut 2005)

I believe it is a foreign movie, possibly Chinese or Japanese. It is about a teenager (I think a boy with short black hair and dark clothes. He may have had a sword across his back though not 100% sure) who lives in a village surrounded by a huge (I think red) wall that blocks them from the forest. The kid is warned not to go into the forest because there are monsters there. I remember a scene of him sitting on the slanted roof of a house staring at the woods over the top of the wall. Oddly enough, I don’t think there were any other children in the movie. One day, he sneaks out (I think through the gate in the wall) into the woods. He finds the monster, which I only really remember being a blur of darkness in a dark forest. 

Edit: it was animated, in a very painted, artsy, whimsical style though I don’t know how to name those styles so I couldn’t put a name to it

I went in with much lower expectations this time. I’ve been having a “crappy blockbuster” stint lately (Jurassic world films, pirates films) so it’s sort of my genre at the moment. Like everybody else I expected another LOTR and was sorely disappointed at the cinema three times over.

With reduced expectations I could see it for what it is - a crowd pleasing, beautiful, action packed journey that only really teeters off in the last film of the trilogy, punctuated with beautiful landscapes, a suitably epic soundtrack and more monsters than you can shake a wizard’s staff at.

By the time the battle of the five armies starts there is just way too much to tie up, and the result is it feels like a group of 8 year olds were asked “then what happens? Then what happens?” - it’s not confusing, it’s just a bit of hash. So much deus ex machina.

There’s a lot of characters, scenes move back and forth in time and while there’s some exposition it’s limited. If you’re not paying attention it’s easy to get lost. It’s not a flashy film, it reveals itself slowly over time. It’s funny to think that technically this and a Bond movie would be both considered spy films, because it’s so far from the theatrics of those films. No gadgets, no campy villain, no countdown timer to a bomb about to explode. It feels like what real spy craft would be like. Slow, methodical and low key. 

All of the above is also why it gets better with multiple viewings. The direction is really well considered and confident. The connections between the characters get clearer with multiple viewings. Of course the performances are sublime which is no surprise given the cast.

So I was shocked to see it didn’t get a best picture nomination. Even in a year which had the longer nomination list. This is absolutely an Oscar worthy film IMO and I hope it continues to gain more regard over time.

smrobk,Who was more mentally disturbed Edward Norton in Fight Club or Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind?,0,0.33,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smrobk/who_was_more_mentally_disturbed_edward_norton_in/,16,"After watching “A Beautiful Mind”, I couldn’t help but compare this to my other blog “How Unreliability Transcends Not Only Books, Short Stories, or Texts But Also to Movies”. In that blog I analyzed how the movie “Fight Club” is a perfect example of how a movie contains unreliable narration and connected it to “The Yellow Wallpaper”, likewise in this blog I will be doing the same except connecting “Fight Club” to “A Beautiful Mind”. 

“A Beautiful Mind” is a biographical drama which introduces us to the life of gifted mathematician John Nash through his days at Princeton University to his struggle and diagnosis with paranoid schizophrenia and his attempts to overcome the disease at the end of the movie. The movie for inexperienced first time watchers is very good at deceiving those who aren’t familiar with the character that he is in fact unreliable instead of reliable due to his schizophrenia. 

Through the use of objective and subjective perspectives, and the way the director switches between the two of them, we the viewers often miss the shift between the neutral perspective back to John’s perspective. Thus making it difficult to identify between real events and what’s simply a illusion conjured up in the mind of Nash. An example that showcases this is presented when John wakes up in the psychiatric ward after being drugged by Dr. Rosen and his men, where John notices Charles and screams at him for help, but is ignored by a saddened look of disappointment by him. 

The camera then shifts to the subjective view of Dr. Rosen who simply claims, “who are you yelling to”? This is the first real indication that John is unreliable as how does Dr. Rosen not notice that there is another person in the room who John is screaming at for help. Taking this into account, one can infer then, that from the beginning, Charles was simply a hallucination conjured up by his sick mind, which shows that he was already beginning to display signs and characteristics of unreliability due to his schizophrenia. 

This being said an interesting character that backs this claim when examining John is Charles young niece Marcee. As shown throughout the film, John realizes that he must be hallucinating all of it as Marcee never aged during the three years that he met her at the university. This unreliability is also showcased through a scene where Marcee runs through a flock of pigeons on the ground in the park. One would expect the pigeons to scatter and fly away, but as we watch the flock doesn’t fly but rather goes about their own business as if no one was there in the first place.

This connects to “Fight Club” as one would expect, both narrators have some form of mental condition that impedes their ability to accurately portray events to us the viewers. In the case of the unnamed narrator in “Fight Club” we are informed that he is suffering from insomnia, which ultimately causes him to create the ulter ego Tyler Durden, Vs. “A Beautiful Mind” where we soon find out as mentioned before, John Nash is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which causes him to hallucinate the characters Charles, Marcee, and William Parcher. One can infer then from comparing the two of these films side by side is how the 6 types of unreliability can be seen in both movies. In the case of “Fight Club” the narrator’s split personalities impede the narrator from having an accurate understanding of his reality, or rather causes him to have two separate interpretations from two different perspectives. 

He is thus extremely prone to misreport, misread, and misregard everything he experiences. This is in comparison to “A Beautiful Mind” where John’s mind is the sole reason that impedes his accurate understanding of his reality, or rather prevents him from distinguishing what is real and what is not. 

This is what makes the two films such a joy to watch, as both films when you first watch give you the impression that the narrators are reliable, only to have a curveball thrown at you and for them to turn out to be unreliable in the end, or about halfway through.",1644244501.0

smqfky,The Lord of the Rings trilogy spoiled us with its rich dialogue. No other recent blockbuster has come close,3767,0.85,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smqfky/the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy_spoiled_us_with_its/,789,"We all know that the Lord of the Rings trilogy changed blockbuster cinema: In terms of production, special effects and spectacle, it set the standard that blockbusters have followed since. Big armies lining up for battle, huge sets and fantastical vistas, and all manner of CGI monsters and creatures. 

In my opinion, however, no other blockbuster since has even approached having the same sort of elevated, beautiful dialogue we see in LOTR. Mostly taken from Tolkien, but occasionally created whole cloth by Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, the trilogy is littered with beautiful soliloquies, monologues, speeches and diatribes that go well beyond the average Hollywood film and into the realm of high art. 

No other blockbuster since has even attempted to have such elevated, poetic and descriptive prose make up it's dialogue, and that's honestly really tragic. Many of the best scripted moments in the trilogy sound like they could have come straight from a Shakespearean tragedy, and this sort of writing shows you can combine big spectacle with literate prose and still find success with the audience. 

Some examples of my favourite lines from the films:

**The Two Towers**

Gandalf: ""*The veiling shadow that glowers in the East takes shape.  Sauron will suffer no rival! From the summit of Barad-Dur his eye watches ceaslessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; Doubt ever gnaws at him. Rumour has reached him; the heir of Numenor still lives.*""

Gandalf"" *Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth! I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!*""  

Théoden: ""*What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread! If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!*""

**The Return of the King**

Saruman: ""*You have fought many wars and slain many men, Theoden King, and made peace afterwards. Can we not take council as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace?*""

Theoden: ""*We shall have peace... We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they died against the gates of the Hornberg are avenged! When you hang from a gibbit for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace.*”

Denethor: ""*You think you are wise, Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me!*"" 

Gandalf: ""*All has turned to vain ambition! He would even use his grief as a cloak!*""

Theoden: ""*Arise, arise, riders of Théoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world’s ending! Death! Death! Death! Forth Èorlingas!*""

The depth of this movie has flooded my mind.

Its a story of Evil ( Crowe ) and Good ( Bale ) journey together to earn redemption. 

They both have sons. Evils son is Prince ( Foster ) and Goods son is a young boy. 

Both sons are chasing their fathers through out the movie. Following their foot steps. 

Both have different views of their father. Prince loves Evil and doesn’t question his guidance. The young boy thinks of his father as a loser but is devoted. 

Prince starts the film in this pure white outfit and by the end its bloody and filthy. Being murdered by his leader Evil. Showing his white clothes turn dark is an awesome way to explain blind devotion leads to corrupting of purity. While the young boy who questioned his fathers ways witnesses his father die a hero and redeems his view of him. 

Good and Evil form a bond as well. Good learns from Evil there is no right or wrong only success or failure. Evil leans from Good hope exists and by helping Good complete his mission Evil can redeem himself. Both are seeking inner peace through redemption.

If the history of the art of filming itself had started the same but with the framerate roles reversed (HFR for movies and 24fps for TV stuff), would we be making these types of critiques in reverse, or is there a legit physical/psychological reason as to why we distinguish these framerates to these types of mediums (lower fps for fantasy and HFR for reality)?",1644222185.0

Having the focus of the movie be on the sports manager was really fascinating to me and I loved exploring the business side of the sports industry. That’s one of the reasons I loved Moneyball so much. The story is perfectly done, a story about love and redemption, finding where your heart truly lies in with a great message about treating the people you work with better. It’z amazing how quotable this film is. From “It’s not show friends, it’s show business, to “Show me the money!”. To iconic scenes like the “You complete me” moment. Every character is very memorable and perfectly casted. They don’t do romantic comedies like these nowadays. It’s kinda disappointing having rom coms going from this to whatever Netflix romantic comedy they’re spewing out.

At the climax of the movie, Watari suggest to Yusuke that maybe there wasn’t mystery to his wife he needed to understand. That she just loved him deeply and also cheated on him. She had good and bad to her. At the same time, the climax revolved around the need for us to talk about the terrible things in our past and how acknowledging them can help us move on and live life with our grief. Yusuke cries as he talks about wishing he could talk to his wife one more time so he could berate her for cheating on him and to apologize for being distant and not seeing her after their daughter died. 

Yasuke’s realization comes as he is forced to take on a role in a multilingual production of a play in Hiroshima revolving around regret and coming to terms with one’s misery. The play and movie end with a Korean actress signing to him as Uncle Varna in the play that although life is filled with misery we’ll one day look back at that same misery and be glad we lived. All we can do is move on. 

Am I just connecting dots that don’t exist or is there something to the thought that, in addition to the more literal plot lines of the movie revolving around Yasuke’s struggles with his own grief, the movie is also about Japan being willing to discuss its own checkered past to be able to effectively move forward? Am I making too much of it being in Hiroshima and revolving around a play with Chinese, Korean and Filipino actors? I mean the movie and play ends with a silent Korean woman, an ancestor of the victims of Japanese imperialism from the sex that arguably felt it more acutely, comforting a Japanese man acknowledging his regrets about his past and telling him that there is some value in recognizing and discussing the misery of life.",1644195706.0

It got me thinking about trailers I'd seen for real movies that failed to get released. There's been countless titles like this over the years, but the one that immediately came to mind was *Blue Planet* by Rainbow Studios (no, not the BBC doc).

Flash back to the late 90s: 3D animation is the new hotness. Pixar is the reigning champ of CG, still riding high on *Toy Story* and *A Bug's Life.* Sony has announced they're in development of a Final Fantasy movie, but we won't see it in this millennium. Between these two heavy hitters, monetarily speaking, what could possibly compare to what they're giving us?

Enter Rainbow Studios. 

The Internet is still in its infancy, and about 7-8 years before YouTube, so videos were shared on forums through download links (believe it or not, 4Chan was one of the best for this). One day, a bunch of people start hyping up a new movie trailer for a CG film called *Blue Planet*. And it was totally worth tying up your phone line for half a day.

Originally titled *Deadly Tide,* it's about a flooded Earth fighting an invasion of aquatic aliens (think a mashup of *The Abyss* and *Independence Day*). The trailer had everything a young adult could want. Aliens. Explosions. Space battles and dogfights, but underwater. Giant sea monsters. More explosions. All while rocking out to White Zombie's 'More Human Than Human'. All of this was preceded by a cheeky stab at Pixar for being family-friendly, plus a South Park joke for good measure. This was THE CG movie that would kick ass and take names.

[Judge for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHlwzVqFNCA), but do keep in mind this was *really good* CG at the time.

So, what happened? Short answer: Production Hell. Rainbow Studios kept pushing back the release date, then came *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within* with the final nail in the coffin. For as bad as the script was, the visuals were spectacular and instantly made *Blue Planet* look extremely dated. Some time in the early Aughts, Rainbow Studios abandoned the IP and no one picked it up.

There's been way better adult-audience CG movies since then, but for me, *Blue Planet* will always be the champion that never was.",1644192963.0

smbnet,(Encanto) Bruno misinterpreted Maribel’s future.,11,0.59,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smbnet/encanto_bruno_misinterpreted_maribels_future/,25,"Yes another encanto theory but hear me out. 

Maribel’s tablet is shown to go from the casita being cracked to fixed when you move the tablet. This doesn’t mean that her future is uncertain as Bruno says. It IS certain. It’s certain that the house will crack and Maribel is the one to fix it. That’s what the tablet is depicting. That’s why it shifts from cracked to normal when you move the tablet with Maribel in front of it. This casita is destined to fall and Maribel will make a new one. 

Which plays into Maribel’s gift. Only her and abuela can talk to the casita. Maribel did not receive her door or her gift because she was chosen to be the new caretaker and leader of casita and the family madrigal. 

Everyone that has a gift has all the expectations of them from abela and she puts an immense amount of pressure on them and their gifts. This is causing their family to break down which breaks down the encanto. Only Maribel can fix it because not having a gift shielded her from these expectations and allowed her to grow as a person and not rely on the gift to be her identity and sense of worth. It’s this unique perspective that she has that allows her to help the family mend. Luisa felt worthless without her gift, Bruno was cast out because of his, Isabella was living a lie under expectations and marrying a man she didn’t love because of hers and Brunos prophesy. The family is slowly tearing apart from the inside and destroying the ecnanto. 

Maribel did have a gift though. But it’s not one that can manifest physically. It’s inside in who she is. And that’s a message to the audience that you don’t need super powers to be special, what you have inside of you can make you special too. Every one of us has a gift. We just don’t know it yet. Like Maribel. 

Maribel’s door did not glow and open because the casita is basically her room as the new head of the house. She doesn’t need a special room. Abuleas didn’t have a special one. And abuelas casita is broken. It had to fall and Maribel had to put her door knob on the new casita for her gift to be realized. The new casita is Maribel’s. She created the new encanto. And she brought The family back together under it, establishing herself as the true heir of the responsibility and family center. 

This is further supported by the flashback where abuela first is gifted the encanto. Her three triplets had received gifts, but not her. She has to take Care of the casita. Maribel not receiving her “gift” is a sign that she is the next in line to care for the casita. And the next child in a generation or two that comes up to their door and it fades, it will be met with rejoice instead of dread, because the casita has chosen their next caretaker.

I was watching Rocketman and it is a good movie. Except sometimes you don't understand the motives and the reactions. I noticed that his relationship with his parents was not that good but still there is something that I did not understand in scenes with his parents. 

My question is: Why was Elton sad after visiting his father? And why did he get upset when his father asked to sign his album for him?

Thanks",1644187081.0
sm9k6d,La La Land was a great film!,0,0.44,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sm9k6d/la_la_land_was_a_great_film/,12,"La La Land was a great movie. I love romantic comedy movies and La La Land had been on my list for quite some time. The only thing holding me back was the musical aspect. Finally yesterday, I thought why not give this a watch.


#Spoilers below if you haven’t seen it!


The opening sequence song was cool, but it wasn’t my favorite. However, the one I really liked was the one with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling singing under the lamppost at night called “A Lovely Night”. It was really well choreographed, not sure if it was a one shot but it sure looked like it. 

After this scene I started to like the movie more and more. The other song I enjoyed was when they are visiting Griffith Observatory, titled “Planetarium”.

Also I have to talk about the ending, it was just different than what I’ve seen in the past. It showed what must be sacrificed for dreams to come true. It was a sad ending, but it was magical and realistic. I knew that “Mia and Sebastian’s theme” would be played when Sebastian says “Welcome to Seb’s”.  However I didn’t expect the movie to show what could have been. At the end of the song, they are brought back to reality. But what was special was that during this song they both let go of each other whilst remembering their moments and how they could have stayed together.

Not only was the movie about romance between two people, but it also showed the struggles of two people trying to make it. Both have their own ambitions and I think it truly resonates with the audience about what it’s like starting out.

Thanks for reading everyone, hopefully you guys can recommend me some more movies. After watching La La Land, I’m definitely going to check out some of the older films in Hollywood’s history that are musicals.",1644186539.0

I watch it every so often because Robert Loggia’s performance is so good he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1985. He plays a crusty investigator to Glenn Close’s lawyer and his foul mouth often provides the snickers needed to a serious murder mystery. Example: Close asks him, “Did your mother ever wash your mouth out with soap and water?” Loggia, “Yeah - it didn’t fuckin’ work.” This is a good thriller, but it’s worth watching just for Loggia’s performance.",1644182136.0

◇ good cinematography, makeup effects and props
◇ some character development 
◇a good storyline 
◇at least one smart person :') ( i know irl we all make dumb decisions and I think that I'll probably be the first to die in a zombie apocalypse •_•, but it's frustrating to see characters not doing simple things that could've probably saved their lives)
◇i would also love to see life within a large group of people, a camp for example, where each person has a certain job ( this could also be after the zombies are dead and how they rebuild society)

I will explain latter. Independence Day movies is Dean/Roland work, Geostorm is Dean's movie and Moonfall is Roland's movie.

Geostorm movie was supposed to be released couple months before Independence Day sequel but it is pushed one year latter. Both movies was green lighted around same time (Geostorm in 2014 and IDR in 2015). I highly believe Roland would not make a third Independence Day movie even if he had financial backing because ID: Resurgence flopped. So there is never supposed to be whole ""bringing war to them"" and we would not be able to see Sphere's refugee planet. And that planet is interesting, i thing it is cameo of Earth from Geostorm. How? Because both planets had protective shield around the globe :D

Moonfall explanation- >!As Independence Day: Resurgence had Sphere (AI which comes from species which switched from biological body to mechanical) as a our allies in battle versus enemy, the Moonfall had same thing but Roland tweaked idea and now the AI is our enemy and our ancestors trying to help us.!<

>!I highly believe to aliens in Independence Day: Resurgence sequel would had Dyson Sphere as their home world and every independent queen is supposed to drill into every celestial planets core in order to keep her hive/mothership alive, humans would travel to Sphere's home world via ESD wormhole travel machine and Sphere's machine would download human consciousness into machines/drones and with that they could destroy aliens Dyson Sphere which would kill all queens/aliens. But it would be suicidal mission because explosion of Dyson Sphere could be almost like supernova but it will be fine because only drones were killed. So for the first ever time the suicidal mission in Independence Day movie doesn't require sacrifice. After humans/Sphere won the Universe would celebrate Independence Day.!<",1644178463.0

Did anyone else notice this?

Also, I read the charcater Mirabel was supposed to be 15 years old. If I had watched the film with the sound off, I would have guess ten or 11 years old based on appearance.

Who do you consider to be the greatest film characters of all time. There are countless lovable and iconic movie characters but for this discussion I am focusing on the most complex and psychologically fascinating characters in cinema history. For example characters like The Man with No Name and Indiana Jones are like the epitome of cool but they don't really have a lot of depth. The characters I've chosen are endlessly fascinating and mysterious to me. Also the entire movies are devoted to studying their characters. I have chosen five. Who do you think are the greatest movie characters and what about them is so interesting?

Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver)- He is a man that is so lonely and out of touch with society that he begins to live in a violent fantasy. A ""walking contradiction"" who looks at humanity with disgust forcing himself to act in ways that feed his hatred. He tries again and again to make a connection and fails repeatedly so he acts out his fantasies as a way to be seen.

Jake LaMotta (Raging Bull)- A man who uses his intense rage to succeed in the ring while it utterly destroys his life outside. He truly is an ""animal"" who can't control his destructive paranoia, anger, and bad habits even while he sees it ruining everything he has. He acts out his life problems in the ring, and punishes himself for hurting others by taking brutal beatings.

Laura Palmer (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me)- A high school prom queen who is being victimized and abused. She appears to have a perfect suburban life on the surface but is suffering inside. She resorts to drug use, prostitution, and manipulating others to burn away all of her innocence while maintaining some control over her life and power over her abuser. In the end she makes the heroic choice to refuse to continue a cycle of evil.

Ethan Edwards (The Searchers)- A man filled with hatred and racism but also heroism and bravery. He hates the Native American race so much that he learns their customs in order to violated them, and is willing to kill his own niece after she becomes ""tainted"" by them. He is a true outsider who is destined to be alone and must walk away from family and domesticity for the country to progress.

Daniel Plainview- Another deeply emotional man who can't balance the love for his adopted son with his out of control greed and ambition. He learns to view everyone around him as either a target to be manipulated or a competitor to be bested. He clearly has a deep seated desire for family but his hatred becomes too consuming to the point that he ends up alone with wealth but nothing else.",1644168132.0

I just read all the comments on all the posts I could find about it, and only two or three of them accurately summed up the third part. It seems like the actual story didn’t click for most people. They all kinda went with this:
    
“It’s the end of the world but she’s trying to collect money and fix up the house still until she realized her friends are more important”
   
“I was glad it had a happy ending and that she gave up on staying to find somewhere new to live with her friends”
   
“She gave life another chance, it reminded me of Pixar’s Up”
   
Rosa is in purgatory. They’re all dead. Jen and Elias stayed behind because she wasn’t able to move on.
  
Rosa comments that Jen has paid her with obsidian 10 times already, obsidian represents finding truth in a spiritual sense. 
  
Cosmos is a Jesus/Buddha figure who comes to give Rosa the final push she needs because she’s running out of time. Jen describes him as “a wonder, a celestial force truly” and as a spirit partner who she’s been communing with since they “met” at a Tibetan throat music workshop, which is mainly used as a spiritual exercise by Buddhist monks. When he agrees to help fix Rosa’s house, he immediately says he wants to do some carpentry. He uses the wood to build a boat instead. 
   
Rosa and Cosmos have this exchange as Elias leaves:
  
“There’s nothing better out there, anyway”. 
  
“For those who decide not to find it, there can be nothing”. 
   
Elias, a spelling variation of the biblical name Elijah, means “Yahweh is my god”. He “pays” Rosa with the fish he catches. Fish are an extremely important symbol in Christianity. 
   
She’s been spending all her time trying to get rent money from the two people who stayed behind to help her pass on, and acting like they’re nuisances while pointlessly trying to repair this house in purgatory. She was unable to let go of her worldly attachments. Jen finally opens a door and says “don’t be scared” as a white light becomes mist that sweeps her away. It’s during this trippy sequence that she realizes/remembers what’s happening. 
   
It does have a happy ending. And I’m definitely not bashing anyone, but I thought that part of the movie was an amazing representation of a horrifying concept and executed extremely well. It didn’t click for me until the white light with an angelic choir accompanying it. I’m just flabbergasted that of all the people talking about part 3, only a handful even mentioned the religious connotations that were the main focus of the story. 
   
I’m not even Christian, but I just wanted to put this here in hopes of someone who didn’t catch any of this realizing how dark and deep part 3 is.",1644165039.0

Today I learned about the movie **""Chaos Walking"" (2021)**. It's a dystopian action film by **Doug Liman** about a planet with an exclusively male population that has been afflicted with a disease-like phenomenon called The Noise that makes everyone's thoughts hearable at all times. One day a spaceship with a female pilot crashes on the planet which obviously causes trouble.

Now here's the thing: the two leads are **Daisy Ridley** and **Tom Holland** and Mads Mikkelsen and Nick Jonas are supporting actors. It was produced by Lionsgate and had a budget of over **100 Million** Dollars.

Production has been going on for a while (roughly since 2011), with multiple changes in screenwriters, directors etc. Apparently, early screenings were so bad some parts had to be reshot entirely... It had a theatrical release in the USA on March 5 2021 with an additional IMAX release. A month later it was released on POVD and later streamed on Hulu. It made ca. 27 Million Dollars at the Box Office.

It's been the first time that I learned about a movie that I feel like I should‘ve known based on the actors prominence, budget and studio but didn’t because it flopped so hard. Anyone with similar experiences?",1644162445.0

And the other conclusion is probably these are performed after getting practiced by stuntwoman for 1000s of times, and then only 1 comes out to be right, but in the time of practice, I wonder what are the permanent injuries they could have received. Does anyone know how the pencil heels and actions in the movie industry gets executed !

EDIT: for some of those who are saying its achievable,  I have seen ramp walk models trip on those heels a number of times, and they were just trying to walk, high kicks/flying kicks and landing back on those heels are out of the question. If anyone is going to practice those stunts on those heels, a permeant damage to tendon or broken ligament is definite .

Take ***Terminator: Dark Fate***. There's a flashback that features Sarah, John, and the Terminator. Arnie and Linda are the stars of the film, so it makes sense to use body doubles and CGI faces for the flashback. We don't see Edward Furlong as an adult later in the movie, so why do the CGI face? Why not just have a new kid play the character? I get that they were trying to tie into T2, but this was just unnecessary.

Or am I seeing things and are similarities just coincidental.

Here's what I've noticed.

- Both movies are set in the 80s. 

- Both have a style that is characterized by dark lightening. 

- Both are chase movies with an unstoppable killer as antagonist. 

- Both have scenes where the killer enters a police station and murders cops. 

- Both have scenes where the killer retreats to a motel room and performs gory surgery on themselves.

- Both have iconic scenes where the killer confronts an unusuming store clerk behind their counter. 

- Both have climaxes where the protagonist is chased down to the rundown motel where they're staying, from whence a chase follows.

Not a critique, I love No Country. I think it's one of the great suspense movies of all time. Just can't get over the idea that it was somehow modeled on The Terminator.",1644160678.0

What are some sequels that are clearly inferior, but still have an advantage over the original in at least one area? 

**Robocop 2:** The production values are much slicker, the animatronic work is better and the stop motion animated scenes are smoother. The Robocop suit arguably looks better as well with the chrome finish they added

**A Nightmare on Elm Street 2:** Freddy's makeup is better than the original and arguably the best in the entire series

**Game of Death II:** Ok, ""Bruce Lee's"" Game of Death wasn't a very high bar to clear and yet, this is an even less cohesive film that feels ridiculously stitched together...but the fight choreography is fire and that's thanks to the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping

**Superman III:** Christopher Reeve looks his best as Superman in this film. He's a bit more mature looking, since he was now in his 30's, and slightly bulkier. He was probably in his best shape for the role here.

Without spoiling too much, Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine work well together and the movie is quite enjoyable. 

Fast forward to it's remake in 2012, Colin Firth is a wannabe burglar who has a grudge against his boss, the wealthiest man in the world (played by Alan Rickman) and plans to rob him with the help of a lady from Texas (Cameron Diaz) who seemingly owns a long lost Monet painting. Written by the Coen brothers, I was surprised to find that the laughs are cheaper, the jokes are low hanging fruit, and the ridiculousness of events are downright absurd. 

Both films have main characters who are unlikeable, leading ladies with hidden talents, and rich playboys who don't really deserve to be targeted by burglars at all. That being said, they are both silly, have some good surprises, and in the case of the 2012 remake, Alan Rickman literally has the legendary last laugh of the film.

Harry and Peter have an escalating argument that ends up with Peter getting, not one, but two solid slaps in the face by one Harry Osborne. You would think his spidey sense would have triggered somehow, but I guess it doesnt pick up when someone is going through a crisis. Another good slap that comes to mind is in Blazing Saddles, when the guy slaps/punches a horse after being told his animal cant be parked. What are some of your favorite slaps in film?",1644139161.0

It starts off with the awkward use of Sugar Ray’s “Fly”, which feels like some last ditch effort to make it culturally relevant. 

Then the trailer seems to pick moments throughout the film to make you think “this ain’t your daddy’s sci fi movie, this one’s all about sex!”. 

Then we get into the plot, alien artifact, yadda yadda. Then all of a sudden 3 Dog Night’s “Mama Told Me Not To Come” starts up for the rest of the trailer.

Im sure the movie exists in some decade, but I feel we need one in this time too. The privilege of these creeps I hear about for years running red lights, posted outside celebs' houses, trying to catch their kids as they're leaving school, is fucked. 

Say what you want about actors being douchebags, this is a disgusting frame of mind that should be explored in its purest. No ass-kissing politically messages, just ""hey what the fuck are you doing talking to my kids?"" type of shit. 

I've seen a video in the past of a celeb (can't remember her name) whose boyfriend was trying to get her to their car in the parking lot. He was getting so pissed at the paparazzi who simply wouldn't move and kept taking pictures, he shoved their camera back and it hit the brick wall, probably shattering the lens. When the boyfriend stares in his eyes like what the actual fuck is wrong with you, the paparazzi goes on about how he owes him a camera now. As if the boyfriend is crazy. 

Another time I remember Joseph Gordon Levitt getting fronted by two paps flashing their cameras in his face while also calling him an asshole. Mr. Levitt however gets them while they're not camera-ready and simply gives them the nicest ""you know you're the fucking asshole for just doing that right."" talk. Really, couldn't have been nicer about the whole thing. But do they deserve it? Well, I can't say so. They should be thankful when celebs don't wanna choke the life out of them.

I saw it in the theaters as a young Navy sailor all the way back in 1989. At 19 years old, 'movies' for me were robots, explosions, and spaceships. That's what they existed to show us. If you had asked me for an example of a perfect movie in 1989, I would have said 'Aliens'. It had good special effects, good characters, witty banter, and plenty of cool moments. 


But I'd kept hearing about this movie 'Do The Right Thing' by this hot young director Spike, and since I had nothing to do and wanted to get off base, I went to go see it.

As you probably must know, end credits weren’t a thing before the 1970s or so (as they managed to put their entire staff in the opening credits instead) so the movies always just had a simple ""The End"" screen. Usually it’d go like this: final shot - music swells - ""The End"" screen - music stops - screen goes black - movie’s over. It’s a pretty perfect formula to finish a movie in a glorious way and streaming services completely fuck that over.

I want those last few moments of a movie to sink in, but before the final title appears they already start bombarding the screen with some other crap I need to see. It feels anticlimactic and kills the momentum entirely. I remember seeing Psycho on Netflix and they didn’t even let them pulling the car out of the lake before already recommending me the sequel. It’s such a small thing, but it frustrates me every time. 

I get that streaming services are usually not made for old films, but cmon, am I the only one who is bothered by this? I mean, with superhero films they always wait till the last credit scene before starting with the recommendations, so why not do the same thing with old films? Just wait five seconds more and the ending will be much more satisfying. I hope at least *one* streaming service will fix that someday. Until then I’ll just have to rely on physical media. 

Rant over.


Edit: Wow, didn’t expect this to get so much attention. I initially intended this post to be a rant about how old movies are made unwatchable by the autoplay interruption, but it seems like many people have issues with autoplay for all kinds of movies and shows. I didn’t even think about modern movies with proper end credits while writing this post (maybe I’ve just gotten used to it), but I agree, it can be just as irritating as with the case I made. I’m very happy to (if unintentionally) shine some light on this whole issue. 😃",1644103321.0

The flight attendant smacking his head while trying to help Hanks. Bleeding out on the cabin floor while he struggles to stop the bleeding. Then the quick shots of the on coming ocean viewed through the wind shield. Followed by the close ups of Hanks terrified face. 

It all happens so fast, things quickly become detritus yet it all ends just as quickly as it started. By far the most gripping sequence in the film, and of any planet crashing sequence that I know. Very much like the sinking of the U boat in Dunkirk. What made it scary was you saw everyone inside and bam they get hit and 30 seconds later they’re all gone!",1644102987.0

Therefore, the story has more time to develop all of its components and make everything flow natural. Things are rarely rushed and it all comes together organically. Of course, that's not to say movies cannot accomplish that in a smaller time window, but it's usually an uphill battle for them, especially given that they rarely reach a runtime of 180 minutes these days.

On the other hand, film is better than TV due to its mostly superior technical quality. Movies normally receive a much higher budget than shows, and it shows. Thanks to a high budget, a movie can afford better actors, directors and screenwriters. Every single detail can be polished, every single moment perfected in order for the piece to be fully immersive. That's not to say TV shows cannot accomplish the same level, quite the contrary, but they more often than not struggle to get there.

* Lionsgate
* Dreamworks SKG
* MGM
* New line 

# During the period.

 Fox, Dreamworks, MGM, Lionsgate, New line and Universal, pays testament to how fast the movie industry changes, completing a cycle that started with Sony, Paramount and WB 25 years ago.  

# Aftermath

**Putting 1997 - 2021 into** **perspective:**  Lionsgate, Universal, Fox, MGM, New line and Dreamworks   formerly the SHIT studios of the last decade, Dreamworks is now part of Amblin partners since 2016. New line is now part of Warner Brothers. Lionsgate is interstead getting STX to make them stronger. MGM is being bought by Amazon recently. Before COVID Disney bought Fox. Theses 5 were locked in a struggle for scraps, while the original movie titans - Disney, Sony, Paramount & Warner Brothers - traded the top 4 places every year.

# Comments

 

* Sony recovered during the pandemic. Paramount will able to come back some point later this decade. Paramount will see a lot of changes this decade. Sony is pretty doing good recently. With Sony has been climbing up the ladder from 2017 - 2021. Paramount has been falling down in the past 10 years and the Mountain is back up this decade. Sony and Paramount have been mostly doing well during the 2000s. Sony has been doing well for the majority of the last decade. Paramount is doing well in the early parts of the last decade and falls down for the rest of the decade.

 

* Disney and Universal will need to deal with franchise fatigue later in the future. Their history have tend to be move slower due to the nature of theme park and merchandising business. Their golden age won't last forever. Both are doing very well in the last decade. Disney has been doing well for the majority of the 2000s. Universal has been barely doing well during the 2000s. 20th century fox has not been doing well for the most of the 2000s. Universal has been climbing up the ladder in the 2010s. 
* For Warner Bros. , Warner Bros.  has been doing very great since 1997. Their current slump to match Disney and Universal while the others goes up and down. They shown themselves to be quickest studio to react any changes. 
* For the smaller studios. Lionsgate can do better than a major studio during the last decade that has a year of either Twilight, Hunger Games, Now you see me, Saw, Knives out or John wick.For MGM is currently merging with amazon and having a great 2021 comeback. For Dreamworks they can do better than a major studio during the years of either Shrek, Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks films. For New line they can better than a major studio during the years of LOTR, Friday the 13th, Blade, Dumb and Dumber, Mortal Kombat, Final destination, Austin power and Friday.

sldnrz,Which filmmakers could be considered to be the heirs to David Lean's epic filmmaking?,0,0.27,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sldnrz/which_filmmakers_could_be_considered_to_be_the/,7,"In terms of large scale epic filmmaking, no other director throughout cinema's history has ever been as associated with this type of work as David Lean. Of course he has made a lot of wonderful smaller character dramas like Brief Encounter or Oliver Twist but I believe it's fair to say that Lean is best known for his work starting from Bridge on River Kwai to Passage of India. The five films in these time frame are defined by their large scale storytelling that focuses on an exotic location at a turbulent period of time with some explosive set pieces and gorgeous cinematography.

Ever since Lean has passed away however there hasn't been a clear successor to his style. Obviously he has been a major influence on a lot of filmmakers but you can't say that Lean has a heir in the same way Hitchcock's heir could be said to be De Palma.

A few candidates who could be said to be his closest heirs could be:

Peter Jackson whose Lord of the Rings trilogy was explicitly compared to Lean's epics which I think is a major reason why the Oscars were willing to shower the trilogy with so many awards despite it being of fantasy genre. 

Christopher Nolan who has become the most prestigious blockbuster director of our times and who has increasingly mixed more and more complex sci fi concepts with increasingly large scale storytelling. 

Denis Villeneuve who has cited Lawrence of Arabia as the biggest influence on his work on Dune and it's sequels.

There's probably been more changes made to many other films than we know about. Hell, there's even a rumor going around that even old movies made before the 70's are gonna be altered to have products in the films like Coke products and crap like that. People may not think these changes are a big deal, but these changes are damaging to what the directors has made and leave the mentality that it's okay to change a film just to fit in ""modern time"" because the newer films people love today will fall victim to these changes too one day. We gotta learn to love the films for what they are despite how they appear and we gotta stand to keep these film from being altered and have them get put back on the shelves in stores once again.",1644079982.0

As you settle into your seats [you're greeted mere minutes into the film by *this...scene...*](https://youtu.be/Z4P77l_ewVg)

Pretty standard action movie setting, a sexy exotic location with danger at every corner in some far away part of the globe as far removed from the Smith's current suburban hellhole. You could be forgiven for not even noticing the text displayed on screen, ""Bogotá, Colombia"".

However, in a movie theater packed full of Colombians **in Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia**, that scene is less forgivable.

The mood in the theater changed to say the least. The steady noise of popcorn being munched and drinks sipped was very quickly replaced by whispering followed by chattering and then more than a few loud complaints.

The scene comes and goes, transitioning to a fairy tale meet cute where the leads dance, drink, and fuck. Then a line gets dropped in the morning after post coital chatter.

""The staff have fled, this is all I could find.""

The theater erupted in laughter that would make any comedy jealous.

If you haven't caught on by the fact we were watching a Hollywood blockbuster the month it came out in a movie theater with food and drink, Bogotá was not and had not been subject to the kind of violence and panic displayed on screen for a very long time.

I'll preface this with I'd love to read what other regular sub members think of the film, who still believe it is one of the greatest, and why their love for it perseveres.

The film is considered a classic/masterpiece for many many reasons. Watching the film in 2022 can only do so much, but not replicate how it was on release, or how it was when it was unbanned in other countries and again got a home release in the early 00s on DVD (following a theatre release), allowing so many more people to watch it for the first time. All copies had been taken off shelves in 1988 in the UK and Ireland for example, and was banned for 11 years after.  BBFC lifted the ban in 1999 after concluding that the film, 

> “while still a powerful and compelling work, no longer had the same impact as it did 25 years ago""

""The Exorcist"" novel by William Peter Blatty spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at #1 in 1971. That's how big it was - and a film was surely a going to be a goldmine.

The film was advertised as a ""Suspense"" film on release and TV spots - though the TV spots and advertising were horrifying to people at the time.

[The Exorcist (1973) TV Spots](https://youtu.be/twSg42MWcNQ)

[The Exorcist (1973) - Rare Trailers and TV Spots](https://youtu.be/vFqeu8glfHU)

The original theatre release had subliminal imagery (one of the first films IIRC), which couldn't be seen on the home releases, and even in the later DVD follow-ups decades later. There was a restoration fan edit done in the mid 00's released online that had the original '73 release preserved. The subliminal imagery was finally re-added into the Director's Cut release. Imagine sitting in the theatre in 1973, and in a couple of scenes you think you saw a demon face on screen, but other people might not have seen or noticed? [Here is one example](https://youtu.be/Qtrm-K-6iwU). There were also other hidden things in the film [6 creepy things hidden in THE EXORCIST](https://youtu.be/2U_-zjVAo2Q) Some of these might not be the version on streaming sites, the original 73 release.


One thing to be considered, everyone at the time of release knew the film was based on a true story, as a result of the hugely successful novel and it being No. 1 on the Bestsellers for Blatty. People didn't have easy access to find out information, only what they read on magazine or newspapers, TV spots, and word of mouth as regards the real story, so to them, seeing the film, believing it was based on a true story, would have moviegoers ready to freak out before the credits even rolled. Imagine then seeing the film in the theatre, believing is the true story, and being the unlucky ones that caught the subliminal frames, which maybe only a portion of the audience would catch. It sure must have been freaky seeing something, and the person you were with not seeing the imagery.


One thing I love about the film, is the accuracy about exorcisms, that a lot of films get wrong. Only an ordained priest is allowed to carry out an exorcism, and not normal people, and the priest must wear a ""purple stole"" during the rite. The Rituale Romanum is the book that the exorcism rite is read from, which is the Fr. Philip Weller's First English Translation of the Rituale Romanum. This is the exact red book Fr. Merrin has in numerous scenes, and is also the rare First Edition from 1964. Now compare all those minute details from the film, to the recent possession/exorcism films, where anyone and their dog is performing an exorcism, e.g. Ed & Lorraine Warren, and even reading from the wrong books. It's rare to find a possession / exorcism film where the details are correct. Not even Bram Stoker's Dracula gets it right with Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing performing the exorcisms on the ""Brides of Dracula"". Although Van Helsing had the right book, he was reading from the Roman Ritual of Pope Paul V from 1898, which - fun fact, was wrote after the year the film is set in, and was Van Helsing even an ordained priest?
The Exorcist is a masterpiece for many many reasons, and is one of the best, from the true story, to the huge worldwide hit novel, to the production of the film and all the small tiny details, that even most films up to the present still get wrong.


There are lots of crazy cool stuff, like the priests in the film other than the two actors, were real priests, e.g. the  priest friend of Fr. Karras in the film, was a [real priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O%27Malley_(Jesuit)) that was stationed in Georgetown, Washington etc. He wasn't an actor, but filled the roll (also think he is the priest who gave the production the purple priest stole for the exorcism, and probably the same who gave the Weller Rituale Romanum to production to use too etc) I'm guessing the Catholic Church were happy to allow a priest be in the film, as long as he made sure all the details for a ""Catholic Exorcism"" were correct. I still can't imagine the Vatican would have been happy that a real active priest, was starring in a film based on the true story and The Exorcist novel.  However it seems the Catholic church were happy, because the two priests were the heroes in the film.  



The Exorcist steps are a stones throw away from Georgetown University (the opening scene in the film), and every day, flocks still pilgrimage to these locations to walk about. One live streamer visits there pretty frequently, showing his viewers the area, and every time, there are groups of people there snapping pics. Not too many films have people and tourists 50 years later still visiting the locations every single day, to get that picture at the steps, climb them, and stroll about the locations where the film was shot. It's honestly quite amazing the staying power this film has had, and it's people of all ages, from young to old.

Max Von Sydow's acting is absolutely fantastic in the film as Fr. Merrin. He was only 43 years of age playing that role, but [through use of latex, the Dick Smith sfx department made him look like a dying old aging priest](https://theexorcist.tumblr.com/post/19155949494). 43! [Before/After](https://external-preview.redd.it/aJwi_Lu0I24aqCTjZxYluwKuAl5ylppKLVDNz-WR8GU.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=23066d308a7b1c328fa11143ca8986b5491ebebc)


The exorcism scene being filmed with loads of air conditioners to lower the temp on set  so the priests' breath could be seen, which has been copied over and over by other films [My favourite with Jim Carrey and Liam Neeson](https://youtu.be/cMh6UjbjgRs). It truly was a masterpiece that set the bar high for anything to come close, and 50 years later, arguably none have bettered it. You know the movie is a masterpiece, when Leslie Nielson stars in a spoof film [Repossessed Trailer](/https://youtu.be/A1kMj19UbNU) with even Linda Blair, the original Exorcist actress.


The film might not be terrifying by the standard of today, which the British Film Censors even said when unbanning it in 1999, twenty-three years ago, but it is still a damn good suspense film, through camera-work, story, production, set-design, and the acting. Also, if one has the right version of the film, with the original creepy shots, and audio - it can still be pretty tense.


And another fun fact, the actor that plays Fr. Karras, his son plays the lead role in ""The Lost Boys"" as Michael (Jason Patric).

""The Exorcist"" (along with the different versions of ""The Wicker Man) is my comfort-movie, that I can just pick a different version, press play, and have it as background noise, or sit and chill watching it on the projector on a cold dark night. Even 50 years later, it still deserves the respect for the impact it has had. It was the highest-grossing film of 1973, and was nominated for 10 Oscars, and won two. Screenplay by Blatty, and the Sound category. Which is why I said earlier, one needs a version with good sound. Not many of the releases had the sound of the original release. The fanedit has the Original.  The original, Academy Award winning mono soundtrack has been restored (track 1). The original 1979 Dolby remix is featured on track 2, and a new DTS 5.1 mix, created from both the '73 mono mix and the 2010 remaster, is featured on track 3.

* usually this happens when a character is first introduced in a movie, or when a biometric scan (face/eye recognition) is done on the character 
* there is some pop-up text on the screen which provides details on the character (e.g. name, age, job, hobby, superpower, etc.)
* usually animated in a typewriter style where words appear one letter at a time, as if the details were typed in 
* sometimes also executed in the form of a mugshot, where the character's face is taken from multiple angles, then details of the character starts appearing at the side

With how stacked the cast is with cult actors and Stuart Gordon favorites like Jeffrey Combs, I wish Barbara Crampton would have been in it, as well.

sl4kkr,Anyone actually participated in a test screening?,2,0.55,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sl4kkr/anyone_actually_participated_in_a_test_screening/,12,"Test screenings are quite notorious. 

The meme is that studios grab a bunch of 'mall-walkers', throw them into some subtle, art-house masterpiece with dark depressing themes and an extremely dark ending which they have to sit through.

Then they hand out cards that have benign questions like ""who was your favourite character?"", ""What was your favourite scene?"" and then ask ""What would you like to see more of?"".

The comments are then all like ""too confusing"", ""not enough action"", ""I liked the dog, he were funny, I want more funny dog"", ""ending too depressing"", ""not funny enough"".

Then the comments go straight to the filmmakers who then have to change the end to something happy, add a load of action to a film that doesn't have any, make a random dog in the background the main character who talks and says funny lines.

I've only really been to those pre-screenings where you went online afterwards and, essentially, gave your cinema-score rating and a brief review with things you liked and didn't like. It didn't feel like the comments we gave were actually effecting the film itself though, just giving a rough audience vibe about the movie.

I know from experience that automod commits murder against titles with either of those words.

I know how automod gets to that boiling point and turns into a psychopath, and believe me I don't want to start a bandwagon post. But I'm honestly curious what other people feel about the movies that are widely considered ""classics"" or ""influential"" - and those that aren't, but should be.

My dad has it on for Star Wars (1977), and I'm inclined to agree with him on many of his points. In my view, it did revolutionize the film industry and pave the way for many of the films we see today. The special effects, though dated today, were revolutionary for the time, and the decision to have an original score in a sci-fi movie was a radical, but ultimately fruitful move. 

I'm sure there are people who don't think Star Wars, to use my specific example, was as influential as my dad - and to a certain extent, myself - think it was.

The fact that everyone kept their natural accents while playing Frenchmen didn't bother me, some of the color and light chocies did (but I admit that it might just have looked worse because I was watching during the day light) and it has interesting story telling where it plays with truth and perspective.

SPOILERS!  


I guess my only issue has to do with the perspectives of truth. It is easy to understand how two characters could have a different view of their relationship when they both put greater emphasis on their own achievements than of the other (Jean and Jacques) but it is harder to understand how Jacques could think that he had consensual sex with Marguerite when even his own memory shows her saying no. I guess Jacques is just a terrible person?

Some people compared the film to Rashomon because of the perspectives on truth, but I think (as far as I remember that film) that it did it better because everyone's truth was of the same event and vastly different. In The Last Duel, the film just end up telling the audience that Marguerite's truth is also the objective truth, which I think underminds the film's earlier stance on people having their own perspective on truth. It almost makes me wonder what the film would be if they wouldn't have shown the rape, so that there actually would be some uncertainty.

But than I realized I saw her in Bram Stokers Dracula first. That said I've only seen a few of her films she's been in like Tears of the Sun, irreversible, Under Suspicion  and Spectre along with Matrix and Dracula. I think acting wise she's incredibly talented and is able to bring such raw emotion to the screen especially films such as tears of the sun and Irreversible. She's also a complete fox of a woman. Like the definition of perfect. 

People complain about Keanu Reeves acting in Dracula but if it weren't for Keanu Reeves, Monica bellucci wouldn't have done matrix reloaded and we wouldn't have gotten that cool meta scene where they were playing Dracula's brides in the background and where she wanted a kiss from Neo. (She played Dracula's Bride in the movie) That means that we also don't get her in her iconic red outfit in revolutions.

Spectre I thought was terrible. The one good thing about the film was her in it and I think it's a shame she wasn't the main bond girl all throughout Spectre and No Time To Die.

I think that message would be fair for a movie like In this little corner of the world, although it would be still an oversimplification, but it doesn't make sense for Grave of the Fireflies, because the movie clearly blames the main character, and not just external circumstances, for the bad things that happen to him in the end.

There is a scene that summarizes the meaning of the whole movie, where we see Seita and Setsuko having fun at the beach while a child is working hard with his family just next to them. The workers look at the main character in disbelief, because Japan is in the middle of a horrible war and it's just mind-blowing that Seita can be that irresponsible. He is old enough to know better, but for the little we see of Seita's parents they are represented as too westernized, and I think it's implied the mother was too weak and the father too lenient to give their children a ""proper"" japanese education. From the point of view of the movie and the book it's based on (it's a true story), as Seita has never learned proper civic behavior, he is an egoist that ignores his duties towards his family, and that dooms him in a situation where he should be fighting together with his community for survival. 

I was wondering if the true message of the film gets diluted because people just thinks of it as a cute cartoon, so it doesn't seem real enough. Would people get the wrong message about Anna Franks' story if all they knew about her was condensed in a Disney cartoon? The perception in the west is that animation is for little kids, so even serious subjects like the story of Anastasia or Pocahontas are dumbed down and the films don't take themselves seriously.

I hadn't watched it for 20 years until today. I remember being very disappointed back in the day. The expectations were just extremely high. 

Having rewatched, I have to say that it's a marvelous film. Osment's acting is out of this world. He hits all the right notes. He's expected to do things where I expected him to slip, because of where scenes were taking him, but he nails it every time. His voice intonation, his body movement, his facial twitches. 

The story is really beautiful. Just a rollercoaster ride of emotions and adventure. 

Above all, it's a treat to see Spielberg do his thing at the very height of his career, post Saving Private Ryan. The directing and camerawork is exillerating, ranging from the dramatic to the exciting. The movie has so many great stand out moments, from David cutting his mother's hair to Gigolo Joe assuring a nervous client to David taking a 2000 year long nap.

I thought the first hour was uneven. I loved the idea of lingering so long on this intimate family, before unleashing David on this adventure, but I felt the family dynamics could have been done better. I didn't like the acting of any of the three family members. The movie could have had 20 minutes cut. 

It felt like Minority Report in that they are both great movies that I felt had the potential to be even better than they are. 

I'm not sure if many would agree, but I think I'd rate this higher than I do Minority Report and E.T. Just below his very best pictures. I'll watch The Color Purple tomorrow just to get a sense of where this ranks in relation to that.

skw53y,What was the economy like in 2004's NY (Spider-Man 2),5,0.56,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/skw53y/what_was_the_economy_like_in_2004s_ny_spiderman_2/,17,"Something occurred to me while watching the 2004 movie, Spider-Man 2. 

Early on in the film when Peter and Aunt May are discussing her financial issues, she says something like ""so I've fallen a bit behind, everyone has"" (referring to her missed mortgage payments). The first Spider-Man was released in 2002, and the second in 2004. 

We know from dialogue that it's been nearly 2 years since the events of the first movie, and it's usually simpler for audiences to assume that the film takes place in around the same time period that it's released in.

Thing is, after a recession in 2001 the US economy boomed, and that boom would've been near its peak in 2004. Aunt May's comment that ""everyone"" is behind on their mortgage, or experiencing financial trouble, wouldn't reflect the general state of the economy nationwide AFAIK. 

Were there particular issues affecting New Yorkers during this time period, aside from it being really expensive to live there in general? Am I getting the state of the US economy in 2004 wrong? Or was she just trying to deflect her son (basically) from his concerns over her financial situation? It makes sense why she personally is behind on her mortgage. Her breadwinner was killed 2 years ago, and life insurance and Social Security can only get her so far. 

I'm just wondering if financial problems really were a widespread issue in 2004, either for the country at large or for people in New York specifically. This line could just as easily be her deflecting like I said.",1644029356.0

I have a really interesting theory on one part of the movie.

For those who’ve seen or remember the movie, at Heather Hills Sweet Sixteen performance, Rodrick and his band crew intended to put on a performance for Heather. Rodrick was doing this in order to try and impress her and go out with him. 

The performance ends up failing miserably with everything being a mess and Heather being absolutely terrified and disgusted with everything that has happened. 

We later see Greg apologize to Holly, Heather’s sister, for what had happened. Holly tells him not to apologize for any of it, telling him that Heather wanted people to remember her Sweet Sixteen and that people are certainly going to remember this. She then holds Greg’s hand much to his own shock. And the two become closer then before.

Here is my theory on this: Rodrick intended for his Sweet Sixteen performance for Heather to fail so that Greg could get closer to Holly.",1644028217.0
skvo2q,Whodunnit in Rashomon (And why it's the Woodcutter),0,0.5,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/skvo2q/whodunnit_in_rashomon_and_why_its_the_woodcutter/,1,"TL;DR Everyone lied in order to keep the police off of the Woodcutter who actually killed the Samurai, and his despair in the framing story at Rashomon is him projecting his guilt

Just watched Rashomon for the first time last night (Pretty great) and of course I knew the basic bones of the premise going into it, so half of me watching the movie is trying to genuinely figure out who killed the Samurai. While I don't think there is an answer period, I do have a bit of a fringe theory as to what exactly happened based almost entirely on how in all of their stories besides for the Woodcutter's actually claims to have killed the Samurai themselves.   
I do think the Woodcutters' story has the most truth (The Wife instigating the fight, the two flailing at each other, the two men hesitating in wanting to kill each other) it's immensely obvious that a bandit would have a harder time than what was presented in defeating a trained samurai (No matter how cowardly). I think somewhere in the middle of the fight, the Woodcutter saw that Tajomaru was on the ropes, maybe he sympathized with his fellow bandit, maybe he didn't have a fondness for samurai, maybe he wanted to steal that expensive looking knife laying in the ground, whatever reason, the Woodcutter jumped in and delivered an unexpected killing blow with his axe. He felt guilt almost immediately and both the Wife and Tajomaru seeing this and empathized with him, Tajomaru devised a plan, he would deliberately get caught, take the fall and say the Samurai died honorably by his hand so the Woodcutter wouldn't get in trouble, it'd be no problem, he's already wanted, no one would suspect anyone else. The stories would be straight if it wasn't for the fact that the Samurai and his Wife had conflicting emotions on the murder and Tajomaru. The Wife didn't want someone she cared about taking the fall for a crime he didn't commit and she almost certainly had difficulties with her husband, so she tried to absolve Tajomaru and potentially herself by saying she killed her husband in a fit of hysterics, and who wouldn't believe a grieving woman in Feudal Japan, they all thought women were soft, nice creatures, certainly none of them could be rationally blamed for murder? The Samurai on the other hand wanted to absolve everyone, despite his anger at his wife. He would say that he killed himself after everyone ran off, that way no one could be blamed for his death and he can still be known as dying honorably.   
Any way it could have happened, the common thread is claiming they killed the Samurai, potentially to preserve his honor and absolve all other participants, and completely leaving the Woodcutter out of it, the Woodcutter, hearing all of them lie for him, couldn't understand it, why would three random strangers want to absolve him of all people? He projected his guilt for his selfish act on all of them, if he was so cruel, how could they not be? They must be in it for themselves. Only upon finding an abandoned child does he understand, that while the world is a cruel dark place filled with murderers like him and liars like Tajomaru, the Samurai and his Wife, all of these people wanted to do right by someone who made a grave mistake. Despite him being poor he decides to take the child himself, to prove to himself that he was worth saving and that people like him can still do good despite humanity's inherently selfish nature.

Anyways, that's some of my mixed up thoughts with zero connections, and I do have some other theories on what happened so honestly if someone with better analysis powers than I do go over Rashomon that'd be great cause these days I think we have the abilities (thanks to the internet) to actually solve one of the oldest mysteries in film.",1644027947.0

And when they wanna contrast color for the red, what do they choose? Green. Every time

Even the multitude of pot plants have red flowers ffs

[Coherence 2013](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/)

[Sunset Unlimited 2011](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1510938/) - starring Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Great dialogue between two strangers

[Moon 2019](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/) 

[Rope 1948](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0040746/) - Alfred Hitchcock

[Rear Window 1954](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0047396/)

[Exam 2009](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/) - The whole movie literally takes place in 1 room. a fun one if you liked Coherence. Good thriller with a killer (if slightly predictable) twist.

[Mass 2021](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/) - It's new and not many people talk about it, but it looks extremely interesting I can't wait to check it out. really intense.

[Tape 2001](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0275719/) - Richard Linklater's

Circle (2015) - 50 people must decide on 1 person who will live. one of the most intelligent films. The film did so much with just people standing in a room talking. And dropping dead. Such a clever social commentary. Thrilling from start to end

Hateful 8

Glengarry Glen Ross - based on a play of the same name. It’s about four desperate real estate salesman

12 angry men

Hunger - features one of the best dialogue sequences I've ever seen and it's just two guys in a room talking.

The Humans

Devil's Advocate

Before - Trilogy. Before Sunset, Before Midnight, Before Sunrise

Lifeboat

Phone booth

Buried

Criminal - is great. Not a movie, but fits this to a tee. Plus many language/country options.

My Dinner With Andre - the most riveting, entertaining film where literally nothing actually happens. It's just two men having dinner, but it's nearly impossible to look away.

Dr Strangelove - a lot of it is set in the war room.

The Invitation - The ending is not dialog focused anymore, but 2/3 of the movie is just a group of people having a dinner party that gets increasingly awkward, scary and weird.

Conspiracy - HBO movie about a bunch of nazis deciding in how to solve their problem with the jews in Europe

Saw - Film Series

Reservoir Dogs

Clue

Carnage - a movie in English about parents of two kids who fought in school. One of the kids got injured so the other parents come to apologize

Le Prénom - (""what's in a name"") a French movie about friends who meet and one of the couples is expecting a baby and the others ask what they want to name the baby

The Last Supper - 1995 I t's a really great movie that time seems to have forgotten. A group of grad students have controversial people over for dinner and kill them if they aren't able to get through to them about changing their ways.

The Tangle - an interesting one, for a movie that doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page

Closer

Dinner Rush - Whole thing happens one night in a restaurant.

Two of Us - about a fictional account of a reunion between John Lennon and Paul McCartney in New York. It's just them talking in the living room, then walking around the park, at a restaurant, on the roof. But they discussed about their past, their relationships, philosophies, life and all.

Fail Safe (1964) - same director (Sidney Lumet) of 12 Angry Men and i'd described it as the ""rival/companion film"" of Dr. Strangelove (1964).

An Inspector Calls - with David Thewlis. BBC's TV movie adaptation of Priestley's play is a perfect example of a one-room dialogue-based story.

An Inspector Calls - with Alistair Sim

No Exit

Oxygen - on Netflix is centered around a woman trapped in a high tech box. She’s able to make a few calls out & contacts a few different people but it’s unclear if anyone will help her. I would watch on a device w good speakers. There were a few important lines that I missed watching the 1st time.

Carnage - based on the play The God of Carnage
The Hateful Eight - could also work well as a stage play

Some Velvet Morning - 2013, Stanley Tucci, Alice Eve. Only two actors in the whole movie. Based on a play.

After the dark - 2013, 21 students in a classroom theorise about surviving the end of the world in a bunker. The movie doesn’t take place in he same classroom set, instead shows us the students theories. Not a great movie, but fits the plot.

Spy Game - Most of it centers around an agent being grilled about a problematic mission. Lots of flashbacks/forwards that flesh out the story

The Breakfast Club

Friend of the World - set up like a two person play with heavy dialogue

The Balad of Burster Scruggs - it's an anthology movie, but one of the stories in the movie is what you are looking for

Thank you for smoking

Conversations with Other Women

The usual suspects

Destination Wedding

Drive my Car

Kiss of the Spider-Woman - mostly scenes of William Hurt and Raul Julia talking and bonding with each other in a jail cell

[Friend of the World (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6074542/)

skopo5,What remakes/reboots are as good or better than the original?,4,0.62,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/skopo5/what_remakesreboots_are_as_good_or_better_than/,52,"I see a *lot* of comments about how ""remakes = bad"" or how ""Hollywood is out of ideas and falling back on reboots"", and while I definitely think there is an issue within mainstream studios to lean too heavily on existing franchises and popular IP's, the idea that all remakes/reboots are bad, or that this is even a new thing, is just factually wrong. There are lots of examples of remakes that offer unique takes, stand alongside the original, or even, in some cases, outshine them.

For my money, De Palma's *Scarface*, Carpenter's *The Thing*, Scorsese's *Cape Fear* and *The Departed*, Kaufman's *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, the Coen Brothers' *True Grit*, Soderberg's *Ocean's Eleven*, Cronenberg's *The Fly*, Sommers' *The Mummy*, and even Hitchcock's remake of his own movie, *The Man Who Knew Too Much*, are all examples of remakes that are eirher as good as, if not better than, the original films.

Likewise, Nolan's *Batman Begins* (and Burton's *Batman*, for that matter), the new *Planet of the Apes* trilogy, the new *Spider-Man* films, *Mad Max: Fury Road*, the recent *Candyman*, and both *Evil Dead II* and Alvarez's *Evil Dead* are examples of reboots that stand alongside their respective originals.

So, I guess rather than debate the merit/lack of merit for remakes and reboots, I'd just quite like to celebrate them and hear what other movies people think are as good as or better than their originals, and why? Does the update simply just bring more to the table? Is it an interesting new take that you feel delivers something more on the premise? Or do you just think the modern technology (contemporary to the film's release) enable the filmmakers to better realise the vision?",1644009712.0
sko6ig,Accent work in Killing of a Sacred Deer(2017) thoughts n queries,3,0.64,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sko6ig/accent_work_in_killing_of_a_sacred_deer2017/,11,"I know I’m late to the party but I just watched this film last night and loved it! Looked at a few posts on here about it but haven’t seen something I was wondering about touched on- the accents.

I’ll preface by saying I think all of the acting performances were phenomenal, regardless.

So it’s set in Cincinnati and Nicole Kidman is doing this quite peculiar american accent. I think Nicole Kidman is a great actor but I have noticed across several projects that she doesn’t always pull off American accents well(lapses into Aussie a lot) so I thought that was the case here as well.

But here’s where it got interesting for me.

Irish actor Barry Keoghan is also doing an american accent, it sounded a bit more natural, his voice often reminded me of Edward Furlong actually. However, he has these BLATANT slips into his native irish accent, i.e. pronounced ‘nervous’ like ‘nayr-vuss’ and ‘father’ like ‘fodder’. Those panged out so much I thought it had to be intentional.

Then british actress Raffey Cassidy also did some peculiar accent work, doing a stilted american accent for much of the film and full on slipping into her british accent in the basement scene where she pleads for Martin to make her well again.

This is all made more curious by the fact that Colin Farrell is just speaking in his native edt*irish accent.

Was anyone else as intrigued by this as I am? Any thoughts? Would love to hear.

Also dumb last thought- that spaghetti scene was such such a missed opportunity to tie into the Cincinnati location- instead of noodles and marinara he could have been eating cinci’s signature food- chili spaghetti!! Lol",1644008423.0
sko3gd,What movie villains are incredibly realistic and all that much more enthralling for it?,10,0.67,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sko3gd/what_movie_villains_are_incredibly_realistic_and/,43,"I was rewatching some of the Mission Impossible films and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Owen Davian and Michael Nyqvist as Kurt Hendricks as the antagonists in *MI:3* and *Ghost Protocol* respectively were incredibly visceral in their portrayals of a motivated but very human threats to the world. Almost all of their strength came from the fact that they were supremely driven by their cause and absolutely willing to do anything to achieve it. There was no reasoning with them, no negotiating with them, and their plots were mostly propped up by intricate planning for their endgame. Lastly, they were both very average in appearance as far as their builds, not at all looking like anyone an IMF agent should have trouble dealing with, yet the stunt coordinators, doubles, and the actors did a great job of selling them as relentless to the point of even being pretty competent in fighting tooth & nail for their goal. 

Davian's back-and-forth exchanges with Hunt were an extra bit of icing. You can hear the balance of power shifting every time they interact and really see/hear the terror grow in Ethan each time, and believably so. 

In both cases despite less screen time I found the writing, direction, and acting/casting made them very formidable threats. Neither came across as someone you'd think of as anything but a danger if they had their hands on a button to end the world. I know the MI franchise is much more known for its fun action than anything else, but I think a lot of credit isn't given for other places where at times the series has delivered really well.

I’m an aerospace engineer that loves movies. I specifically work on spacecraft that will go to the Moon, so naturally anything space/moon related piques my interest. I’m not a huge movie critic.. I usually tend to disagree with critics. I’m not going to nitpick this for dialogue or whatever people like to pick out. I generally like when movies at least attempt to be realistic, but I don’t think I will be mad if it’s not since it’s Sci-fi.

What I’m looking for is a movie that is action packed, dramatic, at least some light humor, and has a good CG visuals of the moon, space, spacecraft, and destruction. If this movie can provide this for 2 hours then I will be happy. I’m not looking for some masterpiece.

For reference, interstellar is my favorite movie ever. It combines real science with interesting fiction. A vast majority of this movie is very accurate. I don’t expect moonfall to be this good, but just an idea of what I like. I didn’t like gravity, it tried too hard to be realistic but it just didn’t do it for me. I thought Martian was just ok.  I skipped passengers because it just didn’t look good enough to pay for. Would you at least say this is higher quality that passengers? It certainly looks like it is.

I also enjoy movies like Godzilla (even the 2019 one), the mummy, and Overlord for reference. It’s not my favorite type of movie, but they weren’t received that well by critics and I still enjoyed them. I also enjoy movies such as 2012, geostorm, the day after tomorrow, etc 

Please give your opinion based on my expectations as listed above. If you are a huge movie critic and expected a lot,  then your opinion will probably not influence as much to me because I’m not in the same boat. Expectations are everything imo, and I’m not expecting a lot.",1644006032.0

Quentin Tarantino - Hard one cause I don't think there's a Tarantino movie I can't immediately just start watching if it was on cable or something. I'll pick Death Proof as the weakest entry (but amazing car chase sequences).

We know that after August 29th, Skynet’s only purpose is to destroy humanity and if it did succeed, what plans do they have after that? Machines don’t have any independent thoughts, they just follow their programming. The terminators are programmed to kill all humans, with that completed they would be useless.

skbldg,Is it true that almost all American films feature chickens?,0,0.37,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/skbldg/is_it_true_that_almost_all_american_films_feature/,14,"In the book Wanna Cook? The Complete, Unofficial Companion to Breaking Bad, the authors offer up this rather fantastic notion:

>INTERESTING FACTS

>In almost every American film, chickens - either live animals or depictions of the bird - are featured at least once.  We don't know why and we don't really think it's a Hollywood conspiracy, although it'd be one of the cooler ones.  In fact, it is staggering how often chickens appear once you start looking for them.  *Breaking Bad* is no exception.  From Gretchen's kitchen to the Los Pollos Hermanos commercial, the ubiquitous chicken is there.

The book has sources, but none look to point to this claim.  [Here's a page with a lot of examples,](https://www.muranochickenfarm.com/2020/02/chickens-in-movies-and-television.html) but nothing like suggesting they're nigh unto obligatory in cinema.

I have a reasonably sized movie collection on my hard drive (797 files so far, plus a few more DVDrips/downloads to add today). I've been looking into ways that I can track which movies I have and haven't watched. 

I've seen some posts where users keep their own records in spreadsheets/google sheets type documents, and some that use websites like IMDB to keep lists and update as they go along. 

There are also a fair number of downloadable programs that can provide a UI for a collection. Some have lots of info available as they pull metadata from IMDB, and there are lots of different flavours of UI available between programs, lots of choices here. 

I've not seen the in-built ""tagging"" feature in windows mentioned much, but I think that's how I might start tracking my collection. I'm not so concerned with all the extra data, just want to know what I have/haven't watched yet. 

What about you, what would you recommend? Tell me all about how you track your collections. How much work was it to set up? How much time does it take to upkeep? Do you use multiple devices? Is it just for you, or a full household?

I have this memory of my mum showing me this film when I was a little kid. from what I remember the film started in a diner with a group of white businessmen sitting at a table, one of the men was very angry talking to the others about his boss who was a person of color, (black I think) the angry white man starts saying slurs about his boss while the other white men at the table try to calm him down, then from across the diner a table of black people overheard what he was saying and asks him to stop, the white man then continues to shout slurs while the other white men at the table apologize to the black people. this continues until the angry white man is either kicked out of the dinner or leaves by himself. 

now, this is the part where it gets weird. when he leaves the diner the kkk kidnaps the man and tries to tie him to a burning cross to which the man shouts (from my memory) ""you can't do this I'm white"" or ""what are you doing I'm white"". the man then escapes the kkk and that's all I remember. don't know if it is a real film or not but I would like to find it if it is.

sk66a2,The Fifth Element is one of the Greatest Scifi Stories ever made,21229,0.84,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sk66a2/the_fifth_element_is_one_of_the_greatest_scifi/,1900,"I was rewatching it for the millionth time earlier today and I gotta say every time I see this movie. I enjoy it more and more.

The fifth element isn't some philosophical art piece, it's not overly complex moralistic drama, it's not even a good action movie with badass stunts and cool villains, and it's much more serious than your average comedy. After watching it so many times. I've come to enjoy it that it's fully intended to be a campy light-hearted fun experience that doesn't get nearly enough recognition because it's not constantly tugging at your moralistic center or posing a ton of philosophical dilemmas to the viewer.

the movie starts out extremely campy and has all your tired cliches that we have all seen in millions of movies over the years and it knows it... it deliberately points to the fact that Korbin Dallas is just a gunman ""meat popsicle"" whose only value to the plot is to shoot things and drop one-liner ""badass guy"" cliches throughout the movie. He is technically the protagonist, but the audience is meant to relate to Leeloo more so. The story deliberately makes fun of almost every serious moment it and every movie has without bashing you over the head with the fact that it's mocking those movies. A perfect example of this is when you see Zorg in his office talking to the Priest monologuing on how chaos creates life and that he's all about life and its future to then immediately choke on a cherry. then the priest also makes a somewhat mocking monologue back towards him.

At no point does this movie claim to be deep, introspective, emotional, or philosophical without deliberately cracking a joke right afterward. the plot ends up panning out that Korbin (the kickass soldier) is actually the one who needed help and that Leeloo was actually the one who wasn't in distress.

the lightheartedness of the movie and its campiness even goes into the art design. the whole world is set in what seems to be an industrialized sci-fi aesthetic that's supposed to give off the idea that the world they live being gritty and depressing, but then pulls you right out of this wannabe dystopian world and throws you into a lunar raygun style aesthetic where everything is fantastical and over the top. a good example is that this one ship has like 50 pools in it for what looks like maybe 100+ people and a few aliens only to later throw all of that out the window and set you in the feeling of being in a standard 80s action movie. The story just flows over so many genres of storytelling while making fun of all of them in a way that never feels condescending or like it's beating you over with its points about cliche.

If you have never seen The Fifth Element. Go watch it! it's intended to be a fun burst of a rollercoaster that you never have to really think too hard about while also hitting on every genre beat with just enough force to not become too overdone or annoying.",1643955348.0

A lot of people think that the Grinch is a villain type character (Anti-Social, Mean, etc). However, I have a different thought. If you look at more recent versions of the Grinch it shows that he was raised in an orphanage, bullied for being green, and rejected by the Whoville people. Therefore, I would argue that he is rejecting those he feels has rejected him for his own psychological survival. Notice, in the 2018 version he begins to act human when he is treated like a human being. This has gotten me thinking (even though the holidays are over), how many people has society accidently turned into a Grinch? How people are walking around in our city behaving like a Grinch not because they are mean or angry, but because they are rejecting a larger/mainstream American society they feel has rejected them??

Ridiculously complex script and even to this day I have no clue what the ending is about but that's what makes the movie so good. His next movie Upstream Color is unwatchable to me.

I am curious about continiuity errors and the endless ""mistakes/goofs"" that is IMDB subsection... I remember a book from the 1980s when I was a kid called ""[Film Flubs: Memorable Movie Mistakes](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+pU3mZURL.jpg)"". Back then, that was like pre-internet magic... because the amount of ""nodes"" in your network that may have the same interests were so much smaller, so you'd find or see something, discover a goof, or get some cool trivia about music, movies, and TV and a lot of time your friends wouldn't care, or there was no one to tell. So I remember finding this book and saying ""I AM NOT ALONE!!!""

I was just watching Covenant. I know people have opinions, but it's freaking Ridley Scott. He probably had a 2nd unit director shooting a ""collecting samples scene"". I noticed the foreground character closed the lid on a sample, handed to the background character, where it was open upon handing it to him, and he popped it closed. 

So, Ridley Scott is in the editing room with the editor... do they see it? Do the \*know\* it's there? What's that conversation... ""We cannot fix it, but will people notice? Maybe it popped back open"", etc etc...

OR... for people who edit and do this sort of thing, is it \*IMPOSSIBLE\* for a director and editor to miss stuff like that, and then you sort of ""game theory"" it about whether it's a big deal, can it be fixed, etc?

Anyone have experiences with this? Do they see mistakes and knowingly release them in the wild and shrug, or do people actually miss this stuff? 

I also saw a film that recently accidentally used stock photos, for real, in the film with the watermark and all. I thought it was spiderman but can't remember... how does that stuff happen, get resolved, etc?

Jake Gyllenhall’s performance is good, but he hadn’t yet grown into the actor he is today, sort of like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic versus his recent performances. But my God, Heath Ledger. His performance is absolutely astonishing. He’s just as good in this as he is in The Dark Knight, just less flashy. He conveys with a single glance or a slight smirk what most actors can’t convey in a three-page monologue. He dominates the screen everytime he’s in it despite his performance being very quiet and understated. His vocal mastery of an American southern accent, despite being from Australia, is incredible. Even the way he walks, like he’s both very tough and deeply insecure, confident yet troubled, displays such a command of this role, it’s breathtaking to watch. The ultimate compliment I can give Ledger’s performance is that I only thought about his Joker in the first five minutes of this film, and that’s probably the greatest portrayal of a villian ever put to screen.

It really is heartbreaking that he passed so young, because it’s obvious that he had so much more left to give. I truly believe he would’ve been unanimously regarded as one of the greatest actors of all-time if he had been able to have a full career, if he’s not already regarded in that light as it is, despite such a short career. Please watch this film if you haven’t already, I promise you won’t regret it (unless you’re homophobic, in which case fuck you).",1643939685.0
sk0uzn,Trying to remember an old movie,4,0.64,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sk0uzn/trying_to_remember_an_old_movie/,13,"For a few years now I've been trying (not very hard tbf) to remember an old movie I saw on VHS while I was a kid, something from the 80s.

All I remember about it is that it was a Fantasy and / or sci-fi movie, and the hero was using some sort of thrown weapon. I also vaguely remember a tense scene in some sort of dark cave where the hero goes in carefully and weapon in hand before a fight. There maybe were some sort of pillars in the room. It's a really hazy memory.

Recently I stumbled on [Krull](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0085811/), it kinda fit the bill and it looks like my quest has finally come to an end, but I'm still unsure. Do you know of any other movie with those elements in them ?",1643939194.0

sk0nwc,There’s a lot of Hollywood thrillers about lesbians since way back but none about gay guys as far as I know. Thoughts? Why do you think this is?,0,0.39,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sk0nwc/theres_a_lot_of_hollywood_thrillers_about/,27,"I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of weird sexual thrillers involving intense sexual relationship/obsession between two women. Like heavenly creatures, cracks, mulholland drive, black swan, and so on. I think most movies about lesbians are really dark and the relationship between the leads is toxic, super sexual, sadomasochistic, obsessive. I can’t think of many films that feature lesbians in a sweet relationship. 

Whereas most Hollywood films about gay men are like Brokeback mountain, love Simon and Call me by your name make their relationship pretty sweet and romantic for the most part. Fight Club, Apt Pupil and Foxcatcher are Hollywood thrillers with slightly sadistic/obsessive gay undertones but they’re sort of in the background and go unspoken. 

Why do you think this is? Is it just that if the genders in something like Cracks, Heavenly Creatures or Black Swan had it’s genders reversed it would be more unpleasant; who wants to see an insane sexually repressed manchild hallucinating himself giving him a blowjob, two teen boys making out with each other and then beating one of their moms to death with a brick, or a handsome male teacher getting dangerously obsessed with teen boys and the boys getting obsessed with him too? Are these stories easier to swallow with women involved? 

Is Hollywood nervous of showing gay men having a dark side, especially today? What do you think of lesbian thrillers? Would you watch a thriller about a fucked up relationship between two guys?",1643938624.0

While it is essentially the old cliche of the oppessed cop chasing down the Master criminal and the whole ""You and I aren't that different."" trope. It not only did it WELL, but it also gave each of the characters depth. Without giving them cliched back stories. 

""I Became a criminal because my dad beat me, and my mom was a drug addict."" ""I Became a cop because opposite of those reasons."" It was just. Deniro's character was a Master Criminal and was good at it, and Pacino's character was a damn good cop. And also a decent Step-Father. We didn't need any other information on the characters. 

Also for those wondering.. What happened to Val Kilmer's character after the film. He likely died or got arrested trying to re-hook up with Ashley ""**GREAT ASS**!"" Judd.

This is a story that could be taken in many directions, whether it's a movie or a series. Jean Reno could be in it periodically as the Léon that lives on in her memories and guides her actions (with a little CGI work to make him look like he did in the original movie), so she is both efficiently lethal and untraceable through awareness and habits. They could cut in scenes from the original movie as memories.

As a series, it could have her pursuing different contracted targets (with her taking particular interest in dirty cops in her off time) while trying to maintain a work / life balance with an intimate partner that has bought into a campaign of disinformation on how she makes a living, with precipitous use of Occam’s Broom when they see evidence of her true nature (subtle nod to Dexter). Mix that with a hacker that works with her anonymously as technical support, gaining access to places she otherwise would not be able to and getting into security systems to act as her eyes and ears (maybe the anonymized voice in her ear is someone she knows, could be a nod to ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""). Then throw in an Interpol agent that has been tracking her activities for years and wants to use a fake contract as a sting to catch her, but struggles to get the approval from their superiors due to budget constraints and ethics concerns.

There are all kinds of things that could be added into its milieu, like her resource contacts and contracts all go through a dark / deep web onion server and deal in Ethereum as anonymous (under a codename) NFT contracts (an updated nod to ""The Jackal""). Alternatively, it might be interesting to set it in the John Wick Universe with her operating within and around places like The Continental, having worked her way into that network, with Keanu Reeves making a cameo when she passes the man himself in a hallway with an exchange of nods.

It's all details to be worked out by people less smooth-brained than me that are actually in the industry.

Fans of the original movie, “Léon: The Professional”, what are your thoughts?

ETA1: Okay! I get it people. ""Luc Besson. EW!"". So, we get a different director to do it. Maybe NP herself. MOVE ON.

ETA2: The more you all get stuck on Luc Besson the more I am going to ignore you. One of the BEST comments was u/WiserStudent557 saying NP should work on it with Sophia Coppola (seriously, if I had gold to give...). This is a great idea, and by taking creative control over it, NP can maybe possibly get some catharsis about a crappy time when she was young. Food for thought.

ETA3: I am flabbergasted. I walked away from a campfire and came back to a mushroom cloud. This post really blew up. Thank you all for the awards, upvotes, and discussion: I seriously thought everyone would be like ""no one cares, shut up"" when I posted this.

ETA4: I am just going to squash the Colombiana thing right here right now: I don't care about Colombiana. I acknowledge it was based on a script that was originally intended to be a sequel to ""Leon: The Professional"", but if I wanted to see Zoe Saldana dirt-napping bad guys, I would watch *nearly any* of her movies: it's a normal part of her acting career. Colombiana does not feature Natalie Portman playing Mathilda, as an adult, dirt-napping bad guys, so I don't care because it is not what this post is about. Colombiana is ultimately irrelevant to the intent of this post.

That said, the amount of people that thought I was talking about Matilda, the girl with superpowers, is TOO DAMN HIGH! You all gave me a good laugh though: a female assassin with superpowers would be pretty epic.

To everyone talking about how there shouldn't be a sequel because it would be a stain on Leon's memory: I acknowledge your points about it, but respectfully disagree, because the economy is in such a state that people are falling back on things they would rather not do just to get by (good movies are subtle commentaries on their times). So now we have a Mathilda that tried to have a normal life, but fell into hard times, so she started taking contracts to pay the bills and keep the lights on in her early 30s. Now, 10 years on, she is one of the highest paid in-demand professionals in the world, but people only know her by her codename that she signs the contracts with.

sju0x2,Nightmare Alley and the why behind Dr Lilith (spoilers if you haven't seen it),21,0.77,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sju0x2/nightmare_alley_and_the_why_behind_dr_lilith/,17,"Nightmare Alley was director Guillermo del Toro’s aptly named neo-noir psychological thriller/horror following the rise and subsequent fall of main character Stanton Carlisle, played by Bradley Cooper, and adapted from a book and movie of the same name from the 1940’s. While the protagonist’s downfall and ultimate fate was foreshadowed throughout the movie, the means by which he is led there, and what is left unsaid about the journey, is as interesting to ponder as the movie was to watch. Stanton’s ruin comes in the form of Dr Lilith Ritter, a Fruedian psychoanalyst, played by Cate Blanchett. As this movie is a character study of Stanton, the motivations of the other characters are almost never explicitly stated or examined; though as Stanton prides himself on being able to do throughout the film, we can make inferences based on clues and observations, and I believe this was del Toro’s intention, as to what drives them. Most interesting to take a closer look at would be what drives Dr Lilith to act in the way she does and why she ultimately leads Stanton to his final fate. The reasoning why, in her case, seems to be twofold. 


Dr Lilith has been shown, physically, to bear the scars of her past interactions with men. It is heavily implied, though never implicitly stated that the man who is responsible for this is her former patient, and likely ex-lover, Ezra Grindle. Stanton, in this regard, is a means to her end for Grindle, serving to dole out the punishment she is unable to deliver herself. From her psychoanalysis sessions with Stanton, his character’s feelings for his father, and actions towards older men he sees his father in is clear. Setting Stanton and Grindle together she can reasonably expect disaster to unfold, and though the outcome of that disaster can’t be predicted, she can expect to get what she is really after, power. After setting Stanton and Grindle on a collision course, if all she wanted was revenge against Grindle, there would be no need for her to swindle, then frame Stanton for attempted murder. As he points out in the scene where this unfolds, she doesn’t need the money, so why? She then proceeds to so thoroughly deconstruct Stanton’s character, before ensuring he cannot retaliate in any meaningful way, that even when he is strangling her with a telephone cord, it is clear that she has all the power in the situation. Why though, is having the power ultimately her endgame? The general answer would be that power was taken away from her at some (when she got those scars) or many points in her life. What do the powerless desire, other than to take back control. 


The more complex answer as to why specifically take that power from Stanton stems from two places. First and ironically, his initial assessment of her during his show, when he predicts that she has a gun in her clutch, and why she carries it was accurate. It makes her feel powerful and she was likely made to feel the opposite way from childhood. Dr Lilth needed to set a competent grifter against Grindle, and what better way to ensure his competence than test his abilities on herself. In doing so however, she is made to feel powerless, giving her some motive. Secondly as to why Stanton, relates to how he views himself in relation to those around him. He prides himself on being able to read people and to control any situation he is in. In short, he sees himself to have power over other people, able to get exactly what he wants from them at all times. For Dr Lilth, taking power from someone who sees themselves this way must be the ultimate satisfaction. Consider the opposite. Taking power from someone who perceives themselves to be powerless would be a hollow victory and largely meaningless for her. The fact that Stanton doesn't see himself thus way makes him much more of an attractive target. Again, what do the powerless desire, taking that power back. And who can one take power from, the powerless or powerful? 


The way tl;dr is that Dr Lilth is driven partly by revenge, though mainly by taking power away from people. Would love to hear some other takes on what froce her character to do what she did.",1643921630.0

sjtr8a,What’s a classic movie that you feel would actually benefit from a reboot/sequel?,3,0.56,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sjtr8a/whats_a_classic_movie_that_you_feel_would/,72,"The modern process of movie production by algorithm has led to an epidemic of unwanted sequels and reboots, as studios try to suck the marrow from the bones of any halfway famous property. But what’s a classic movie that you feel would actually benefit from a reboot/sequel? Bonus points if it’s controversial.

Here’s mine:

A few years ago, there was a rumor that someone was planning to make a reboot of **the Princess Bride**. The new was greeted with public disdain, with Cary Elwes himself commenting “there’s a shortage of perfect movies in the world. It would be a pity to damage this one.” The idea pretty quickly died shortly after.

But I’d like to voice the opinion that not only could a sequel/reboot to the Princess Bride be desirable, but that the story is uniquely well suited for one.

Hear me out. While the Princess Bride is, in a lot of ways, a timeless movie, retelling has always been central to it. The original was famously framed with the authors accounts of trying to adapt the story, whose original text was supposedly so filled with obscure political allegory that it was basically unreadable.

So right there, you already have the premise for the sequel in the text. In fact, it pretty much writes itself: Fred Savage tries to tell the story to his kid (or, soon enough, grand-kid) but finds he was only getting the cliff notes. He tries to retell the version he got, but it doesn’t match his kid’s sensibilities (“why doesn’t Buttercup do anything”). So he tries to make updates, but it’s hackneyed and overly topical, and so on. Meanwhile, Fred is having his own personal crises, with his marriage/career/whatever not turning out how he expected. Maybe he finds out his Grandpa was different than he thought, too, etc. In the end he strikes a balance in both the story and his life, learning how to hold onto to timeless things, while also changing where needed. A thematically coherent arc is completed, and something is added to the original. Bing, bang, boom.

Now, granted, this could be really annoying if done poorly. Meta-narratives like that can get tedious really fast, especially with studios keen to add a sort of winking nod that makes it obnoxious. But it would still be worth a *try*.",1643920905.0

Now this topic is not to criticize their creative talents but just wondering what prevents them from using it to make a great film at a low budget? 

Going onto other film directors, Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan, come to mind as both of them started out with low budget hits but now only make big budget films. Tarantino made Reservoir dogs ($ 1.2 million budget) and subsequently Pulp Fiction ($ 8 million), both relatively low budget compared to his later films while Nolan started out with really low budget films and scoring his first hit with Memento ($9 million budget). Both of them never made any low budget films after that and budgets of their films kept increasing over the years. Yet today Pulp fiction is considered to be Tarantino's masterpiece and Memento one of Nolan's best films ever.

Now in regard to this post I want to mention Alfred Hitchcock. At the peak of the career he made Psycho ($800k) after making films like Vertigo and North by Northwest (both relatively having a bigger budget). The circumstances which led to his making the low budget Psycho is another story but he proved that he could still make a low budget film and score a mega hit. Today it is considered to be his most famous film. 

Another director that comes to mind is Stanley Kubrick who made the relatively low budget A clockwork orange ($2 million) after the big budget 2001 a space Odyssey ($12 million) and both films made money and also considered amongst his best works.

I was so disgusted I cant believe it. the only way this story would have worked if he was previously a chicken man and accidently escapes and then has a downward spiral. there is no reason for coopers character to turn into the chicken man. its terrible writing and he should be embarrased for releasing this film. I am always astounded with how many bad films get made each year. dont they have anyone on set with a brain to help write this crap?

I found him terrifying as a child, and even as an adult, because his evil was very human and common. 

He was a judge who was very high up the church hierarchy, deemed by the public as a virtuous and pious man of the utmost degree, and who killed and maimed believing that God himself was on his side. His arrogance and maliciousness, fueled by his dogma and utter fanaticism, made him believe that he is superior to the “common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd”, let alone oppressed minorities. 

Like any self-absorbed oppressor, you could see that his need to play God and quench his thirst for control surpassed any other goal or desire of his. That, coupled by religion and the fear that he induced in people, gave him the power of being capable of doing anything in his crazed pursuit of a Gypsy woman; even if it came to burning down an entire city if he wanted.

He was tall and very imposing, wearing a black cape with purple and red accents. He moved and talked as if he was at conflict with life itself; as if everything around him was impure and disgusting and beneath him. 

Frollo, both in the book and the Disney movie, showed no empathy. None. He raised Quasimodo just out of fear of going to hell. He only showed compassion towards his own self, and even at that, he refused to take responsibility for any of his actions, blaming the destruction he left in his wake on everyone but himself.",1643897446.0

Playing a tough, hardened superhero, is very good. However, basing your entire career around it, and not exploring other talents you may have is bloody awful.

Seriously, how boring must it be to have played the same, bland, angry, bitchy character since Resident Evil 1. It starts to have a psychological effect on the audience, when the only character we’ve seen you play, is an angry female protagonist. I swear, I’m sure she is a lovely woman IRL, but any movie I see her in, all I can think is, ‘oh god, what ex boyfriend has ruined her life, to the point where she hates everyone and doesn’t take jokes too well’. 

It’s the same thing with Dwayne or Vin Deisel. Just, Vin Deisel will always be Dominic Toretto, and Dwayne hasn’t stopped playing The Rock. 

I guess my problem is, these actors have been type casted (Michelle allowing herself to be), to the point where I don’t see the character they are playing, and only the Actor/Actress, themselves. 

You know I actually got a bit emotional in **Spoiler Alert** No Time to Die, when James Bond had that whole arc with his daughter, and he actually seemed to care about her. And I shed a tear when he died!!! Like Daniel Craig can play a character with less emotion than Ant, but still in his final film, top off with a a beautiful arc. 
And, when he played knives out, I wasn’t watching James Bond, or Daniel Craig, I was watching Detective Blanc. 

I guess what I’m saying is, type cast are ruining any character that may be written. Unless she changes her style, I’ll never be able to watch a movie with Michelle in it, and not see angry Michelle.",1643892894.0
