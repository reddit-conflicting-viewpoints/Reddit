sotez4,Montgomery Clift: why is he forgotten?,8,0.69,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sotez4/montgomery_clift_why_is_he_forgotten/,10,"During his lifetime Montgomery Clift was considered the equal of his method acting contemporaries Marlon Brando and James Dean and yet both have completely eclipsed him in terms of fame. They are still well known and iconic today whereas Clift is mostly forgotten by the general public. It's ironic because Clift was actually the first of the method actors to make his film debut (before Brando and Dean) and he blew audiences away with his performance in The Search.
It was a performance that felt real and believable and it was like nothing audiences had seen before. People actually thought Clift was a real soldier and they would go up to the director afterwards asking where he found a soldier who could act so good. Clift was one of only 6 actors in film history to receive a Best Actor academy award nomination for his screen debut.

He would continue to give excellent performances in A Place in the Sun and From Here to Eternity and in the 1950's was considered among the greatest film actors of his generation. Sadly Clift had personal problems and after surviving a terrible car accident those problems only got worse. He would continue to act, but by the 1960's his career wasn't going well and he died prematurely at 45 suffering a heart attack most likely brought on by years of drug and alcohol abuse. 

It's sad that he died prematurely because I feel had he lived he would have had a comeback similar to the one Marlon Brando had in the 1970's. Brando had a string of failures in the 1960's and had to audition and get studio approval to appear in The Godfather. His salary for it was only $250,000 a far cry from the one million he received ten years earlier when he did Mutiny on the Bounty. After The Godfather Brando was so popular and iconic that he would be paid millions just for small supporting roles in films.

I bring this up with Brando because I feel had Clift lived he would have thrived in the 1970's, too and been just as popular and iconic as Brando. Most of the directors that were becoming popular in the 1970's were also huge fans of Clift. 
Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese have cited Clift as one of their favorite actors and if the character was written to be older I think he would have made a great Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. I have little doubt Clift would have taken on controversial roles and not played it safe with his acting roles and since he hated the censorship of the studio era (which ended only 2 years after his death) he would have likely felt more free and liberated with his acting roles. So much for what might have been.",1644455574.0

MBJ has talked a little about the story of Creed 3, saying it’s a very personal story and it’s something close to his heart. 

My speculation is Creed 3 will take some influence from the fantastic MMA film Warrior (2011) and have Adonis Creed fight is “brother”, Jonathan Majors’ character. 

Majors’ would be playing another illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, but unlike Adonis he wasn’t adopted by Mary Anne and grew up poor.

Majors’ would have a lot of jealousy and perhaps hatred for Adonis, and would be on a similar path Adonis was on in Creed 2.

This is just a theory of mine and I have no evidence for it whatsoever!

This movie has so much re-watchability to me for some reason. It disappoints me that the production lost so much money but it seems like they had a ton of fun making this one.

sohcii,3 Soviet adaptations of Treasure Island: how do these films differ?,13,0.8,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sohcii/3_soviet_adaptations_of_treasure_island_how_do/,2,"Having gained wide popularity in Europe almost immediately after its publication in 1883, «Treasure Island» attracted the attention of Russian publishers quite early, quickly entering the traditional circle of children's reading. The first adapted translation from the French edition of 1885 was published in Moscow in 1886, in the printing house of the brothers E. and M. Verner, as an appendix to the magazine «Around the World». The translation by O. A. Grigorieva, published in 1904, was considered the most popular before the revolution. In the USSR, the most accessible was a good translation by N. K. Chukovsky, made in the first half of the 1930s, almost simultaneously with a less accurate translation by M. A. Zenkevich. And even now Chukovsky's translation is the most popular, despite the presence of other translations. Naturally, such a popular children's novel could not escape the attention of Soviet directors, and 3 films (there is also a funny cartoon from 1988, but it's not about it here) based on this novel were shot in the USSR at different times, and they were all different in spirit. All the films were called the same as the novel.

1. The 1937 film directed by Vladimir Vajnshtok, music by Nikita Bogoslovsky. In accordance with the party line, the motive of the national liberation movement was introduced into the film. The positive heroes seek to get treasures not out of simple human greed, but to buy weapons for the Irish freedom fighters, and the rich man Trelawney becomes a pawnbroker, a traitor and just a bad person here, because capitalists cannot be good people (in fairness, image Trelawney is also often denigrated in Western adaptations). The guy Jim was replaced by a girl Jenny, in love with Dr. Livesey, who disguised herself as a boy in the plot, and John Silver has both legs, but one has shrunk and is shorter than the second, and Ben Gunn dies here. Also, here the names of some characters are transmitted incorrectly. The film was restored twice (in 1960 and 1983): edited and re-recorded. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A](https://youtu.be/82wCUj3lB3A)
2. The 1971 film directed by Evgeny Fridman. Music by Alexey Rybnikov. In the role of Silver — Boris Andreev, in the role of Jim — Aare Laanemets. Another film adaptation, this time with the involvement of Baltic actors. An almost perfect film adaptation — for some miserable hour and twenty-two minutes, the novel was transmitted almost verbatim! There are, however, minimal changes: navigator Billy Bones, instead of boozing like hell, led a healthy lifestyle and didn't die of a heart attack, but under the bullets of former comrades, alone defending the «Admiral Benbow» tavern; there is no Black Dog; there is no scene when Ben Gunn trolled pirates, shouting the catchphrases of Captain Flint. In all other respects, the film follows the novel as closely as possible, and the short timing does not interfere with this at all. Probably, the reason for this is the filigree, verified work of the director: not a single extra frame. There are also eight songs in the film and there is a very sinister Blind Pew. For this film, the fishing sailing-diesel schooner «Klim Voroshilov» was rebuilt into the brigantine «Hispaniola». The vessel was later used in the films «Mermaid Shoals» and «The Life and Amazing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe» (1972, directed by Stanislav Govorukhin). The ship is installed on the Yalta embankment as a restaurant, now it is one of the symbols of the resort. Disputes about which version is better — this one or Vorobyov's mini-series, which will be discussed below — break out every now and then on Russian forums of movie lovers. Here it is, but there are no subtitles for it: [https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI](https://youtu.be/mjX2B90KFfI)
3. 3-serial TV movie of 1982 directed by Vladimir Vorobyov. In the role of Silver — Oleg Borisov, in the role of Jim — Fedya Stukov, previously famous for the role of Tom Sawyer in 1981 film. There are 3 versions of the film — 220 minutes, 194 minutes and 183 minutes. The initial version was 4 episodes of 55 minutes each. In the 1980s, the film was censored twice and became a three-part series. Scenes of violence, gambling, images of dead bodies, especially scary moments were removed from it, taking into account the children's audience of the film. After the first edition, the scenes disappeared: a close-up of the face of Blind Pew with a cork instead of an eye (""and now, boy, take me to the captain!""); Dr. Livesey makes bloodletting to Billy Bones, Jim holds a basin into which blood begins to drip, the doctor's conversation with Billy Bones (see in the book); Dr. Livesey talks about the personalities of the pioneer pirates (Squire's estate); squire's comment on the identity of the pirate killed by Redruth and fell off a cliff in the scene of relocation to the fort. After the second edition, the scenes disappeared: Billy Bones tells a scary story, at this time an owl flies through the room and scares the guests; Jim Hawkins' dream, where John Silver appears for the first time; a drunk Billy Bones descends the stairs and expels two guests from the table; Billy Bones sees Flint in the corner and begs Jim for rum; Blind Pugh's pursuit of Jim along the coast, Jim falls, entangled in a net, Blind Pew pulls his hands to him; Billy Bones' death (falls from the stairs, grabbing a fishing net); Jim searches Bones' body for a key, a hamster crawls along Bones' neck; Hands and O'Brien play cards ""on knives"" (Squire's arrival in Bristol); Hands and O'Brien play cards in the cabin of the ship (Squire: ""I was shut down!""); Squire Trelawny in the cabin of the Hispaniola makes a toast to Jim's health; Hunter found a skeleton under a blanket in the fort (""Dr. Livesey's reconnaissance""); Hunter's corpse torn by a bomb after storming the fort; carpenter Abraham Gray gives Jim a gun; the beginning of a card game on the Hispaniola between Israel Hands and O'Brien, when each of them holds a card in his mouth; Jim brings a bottle of brandy to Hands: ""Thank you. Cheers, Captain!""; Silver in the fort sips from a bottle: ""Do you want a drink? I'll take a sip. And then there is still so much trouble ahead""; Silver examines the black mark and asks about who gave the paper for it: ""Who gave his Bible for such blasphemy?""; Silver ask about the cut-up bible of Dick Pastor: ""Maybe it is still suitable for communion?"" — ""The Bible?"" With a torn page?"". The most famous is the last, shortest version of the film, which is why many perceive this film as a musical children's film, although, as you can see, the film was originally quite creepy, with notes of black comedy. In the late 90s, the company ""Крупный план"" released a videotape with a little-affected second version. The original version of the film is currently unavailable. Also, the film has noticeably deviated from the original source: Fedya is too small for the role of Jim, and plays some kind of tomboy pioneer instead and the involvement of a nine-year-old boy in the main role contradicts the main motive of the novel — the formation of a teenager's personality (although Jim's age is not specified in the novel, but his psychology corresponds to a boy aged 12-13 years, or in extreme cases 14-15); Silver turned from a tall, exceptionally strong man into a dry, pale, nondescript old man, similar to a physics teacher from high school (however, there is an alternative opinion that this is a brilliant non-canon: he seems homely, but in fuct he a sinister gray cardinal, taking coolness and intelligence. He boasts that Flint himself was afraid of him, in the voice of a Soviet engineer proud of being awarded a prize… But he manages to grab a pistol faster than others, and crushing the spine of a hefty sailor with a blow of a crutch is easy for him. According to the actor, such an image is an evil satire on domestic elderly experienced ""thieves in law"" who feel like the rulers of fate); Ben Gunn armed himself with a blowpipe with nerve poison and killed Silver, allegedly by accident; Billy Bones, performed by Leonid Markov, is rather an anti-villain, sincerely tired of the bloody pirate freedom and looking for a quiet and peaceful place to live, even his catchphrase about whether to leave witnesses alive (""The dead don't bite""), handed over to Captain Flint; also, the prologue (before arriving in Bristol) is stretched out for the whole 45 minutes due to the hamsters, owls and shells, quotes from other works of Stevenson and theatrically slow dialogues.

Even describing the plot is just absolutely insane. Mrs Robinson seduces a college graduate, has an affair with him, restricts him from seeing her daughter, arranges a marriage to stop Ben from seeing her daughter, and in the end gets locked inside a church while her daughter and Ben do whatever they want for the year and a half before they get divorced.

I watched the first half (up to the stripper date) last night and watched the second half today. And they are basically two completely different films. The first half is Ben and Mrs. Robinson’s story, and the second is Elaine and Ben’s story. And another thing I loved is how the characters completely changed within these two halves. Mrs. Robinson reveals her true self by forcing Elaine into a marriage and accusing Ben of being a rapist. Ben shows how awful he can be, by tormenting a girl on her first date and stalking her.

There is no protagonist. If you forced me to pick one, probably Elaine, but that’s because she ends up looking the best. Ben and especially Mrs. Robinson have shown how despicable they are, and it’s great that this movie tries to tackle this for a movie that was made 55 years ago.

Loved the first fifteen minutes due to how fast-paced it was. Loved Ben breaking into the Robinson housefor how fast-paced it was.

However, this movie does have some criticism from me, and that’s mainly due to the soundtrack. They play the same two songs THREE TIMES EACH. And they played the fair song like five minutes apart from each other, that’s just not enough room to breathe.

Overall, 10/10. I can’t wait to watch it again.",1644370348.0

Even describing the plot is just absolutely insane. Mrs Robinson seduces a college graduate, has an affair with him, restricts him from seeing her daughter, arranges a marriage to stop Ben from seeing her daughter, and in the end gets locked inside a church while her daughter and Ben do whatever they want for the year and a half before they get divorced.

I watched the first half (up to the stripper date) last night and watched the second half today. And they are basically two completely different films. The first half is Ben and Mrs. Robinson’s story, and the second is Elaine and Ben’s story. And another thing I loved is how the characters completely changed within these two halves. Mrs. Robinson reveals her true self by forcing Elaine into a marriage and accusing Ben of being a rapist. Ben shows how awful he can be, by tormenting a girl on her first date and stalking her.

There is no protagonist. If you forced me to pick one, probably Elaine, but that’s because she ends up looking the best. Ben and especially Mrs. Robinson have shown how despicable they are, and it’s great that this movie tries to tackle this for a movie that was made 55 years ago.

Loved the first fifteen minutes due to how fast-paced it was. Loved Ben breaking into the Robinson housefor how fast-paced it was.

However, this movie does have some criticism from me, and that’s mainly due to the soundtrack. They play the same two songs THREE TIMES EACH. And they played the fair song like five minutes apart from each other, that’s just not enough room to breathe.

Overall, 10/10. I can’t wait to watch it again.",1644370348.0

so0wc6,Analyzing Allison's Transformation in The Breakfast Club,38,0.73,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so0wc6/analyzing_allisons_transformation_in_the/,22,"First, a little disclaimer. I do not frequent this subreddit, but I wanted to make a post about this and I thought this would be the best place for it (if it isn't, please let me know). This is going to be a long post, with some discussion of (relevant) personal experiences so buckle up. The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies, Allison is my favorite character, and I relate to her a lot so I have a lot of thoughts about this topic. This also might be all over the place, so I apologize in advance for that. 

Now let's get into the actual topic. I've seen debates about [Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club](https://youtu.be/rprB-_jyLjU?t=60), with comments about how her makeover was out of character, made her look worse, and is just another example of a girl changing herself to get a guy. I understand the frustration and where these comments are coming from, but I think that is a very surface-level analysis of this scene and a disservice to Allison's character development in the movie. 

First of all, I think the makeover serves as a physical manifestation of her growth throughout the movie. At the beginning of the movie, she appears dressed in all dark colors, is fully covered, her hair covering her eyes, and her body language is very closed off. Her character is introverted, painfully shy, quiet, a little weird, and it is implied that she has little to no friends. 

But as she gets to know the rest of the group, as she forms relationships with them and starts to be able to show who she truly is, she begins to open up to them. She tells them about her personal struggles, about how she gets no attention at home and is a compulsive liar (which are important to her character but I'm not going to get into that in this post). She also becomes louder and brighter, inserts herself into conversations, and starts to take up space. 

Considering that, the makeover makes so much sense in her journey into learning who she is and how to form healthy relationships. She trades in her black long-sleeved jacket and shirt for a white, collared, short-sleeved blouse, puts makeup on, and lifts her hair out of her eyes with a white headband. She also carries herself with new confidence, she's still hesitant right after the makeover, but if you compare her first scene to her last scene, she no longer closes off herself from others and has more open body language.

Now if you think the makeover makes her look worse, that's a personal opinion but I honestly don't think it's relevant to this discussion. The makeover is about her growth and development, she's trying new things and she's getting more in touch with her feminity. As someone who has had a similar journey as Allison's, growing up I thought using makeup and wearing ""girly"" clothes was too much like ""other girls"". I too would wear baggy and dark clothes, simultaneously trying to distance myself from other girls while also trying to blend in with the wall and take up as little space as I could. As I have become more comfortable with my femininity, I've started wearing more makeup and dresses and skirts, but I also keep parts of my old wardrobe. Just like Allison, I still enjoy parts of my old style (""Hey I like that black shit""), but I also no longer demonize anything related to femininity. Teenagehood is the best time to try new styles and figure out who you are, so Allison's makeover is just an extension of her experimentation and her willingness to try something new and stand out to others. Her style at the beginning of the movie was expertly crafted to make her unnoticeable yet different from other girls, which goes hand in hand with her initial characterization and background, and her makeover is a natural progression of her development and what she learned throughout the movie. 

Finally, the makeover also shows her relationship with the other characters in the movie. I think the dialogue between Claire and Allison in this scene especially shows Allison's growth. Allison asks Claire, ""Why are you being so nice to me?"" and Claire responds with ""Because you're letting me."" Now, this is more of my personal analysis, but this shows how Allison is learning to form relationships with others. This dialogue shows how Allison thought that others (especially the popular kids) wouldn't be nice to her, and that stopped her from forming relationships. But here Allison learns that Claire and the popular kids would show her kindness if she let herself get to know them and bond with them (at least as Claire says). I know this feeling, there's a voice in your head that is telling you that no one would ever want to be friends with you so don't even try it, which I think is probably what Allison experienced as well. 

As for Allison's relationship with Andy, I don't think she ever changed herself for him. As I've said the makeover was to display her character growth, and Andy showed interest in her long before this scene. Additionally, his reaction is not the only important one. Yes, she is obviously most nervous to show him her transformation, but she also puts weight into Claire's and Brian's reactions as well and gets confidence from their positive responses. I see the reactions of the people around her more as support and acceptance of her trying new things and becoming brighter, rather than the reason for her transformation. 

TLDR: Allison's makeover scene in The Breakfast Club is a representation of her character growth throughout the movie, and how she learned to take up space, form close relationships, and that performing femininity isn't a curse. I adore her as a character and I think those who say this scene ruined her characterization are misguided.

Okay, I did deliver on the long post. Overall, I think the makeover is a very misunderstood scene, and Allison as a character is also very misunderstood. I'm sorry if I didn't make any sense, I just wanted to share my opinion about this. Thank you so much for reading this post, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this scene if you've made it this far!",1644370227.0

He reminds me of a Sylvester Stallone or a Bruce Willis only he was born too late and for some reason they never made the Gambit movie. I feel bad for him. He is authentically funny, authentically good at action, and while he may not be Lawrence Olivier, he tries. He can act better than the roles he gets require him to act.

Dog looks terrible. More importantly, it seems like it knows it looks terrible. Like everyone involved in the production and marketing has given up and just said to themselves ""so I guess we are making this"" I mean, they literally just named the movie ""dog""!

But how great would it be if like secretly this was a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and it was going to do things with the medium of Film that hadn't been done before, and the first of those was to mess with the audience by marketing it as a really obviously forgettable movie just to massively overdeliver?

snpw8q,I really do think that Hot Rod would have been incredibly successful if it had been released in the current Netflix streaming era.,119,0.8,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snpw8q/i_really_do_think_that_hot_rod_would_have_been/,57,"Basically, the title. I think that over the years Hot Rod has found its crowd for the most part since it's such a niche style of comedy that doesn't necessarily work for everyone, but I don't know that it ever had any real success. Hot Rod was made on a $25m budget, and ended up landing at a little over $14m worldwide box office - so it pretty much completely flopped. I think that if it had been made in the current streaming era and released directly to Netflix with a limited theatrical release, it could have been a huge success. It more than likely would have reached a MUCH wider audience and would have been much more popular than it is now.

I was recommended Margin Call by an old work colleague which I thought was fantastic. The story is well driven with great characters and performances. 

In particular:

Jeremy Irons as the CEO simply dominates the screen

Kevin Spacey (yes he has problems) is the old reliable

Simon Baker portrays his character very well. Especially ""What time is it?"" and ""What the fuck is his name again"" moments

This is just name a few. Not forgetting Paul Bettany, Quinto, Stanley Tucci (the monologue alone) and Penn Badgley. Pretty much all of the actors are effective.

MARRY ME comes out on Valentines day starring who's it,  what's her face, and Sarah Silverman. I was an avid reader of the webcomic back in the 2010's so here is the whole plot/story as I remember if you want to compare the original to the movie;


Superstar Girl [forgot her name so she is now Superstar] is getting ready for her next big performance with the help of her *very*  pregnant sister - father of unborn baby is out of the picture.


Pregnant sister tells Superstar if she is mentally well - during the awards show two years ago Superstar proclaimed she would cure cancer within three to four years. Superstar snaps back saying she still has a few years left, and she is fine.


Meanwhile, a guy named Guy has been dragged along to Supestars concert by his BFF Parker. Parker is in love with Superstar and is hoping Superstar will sign her poster MARRY ME written on with bright red ink. Guy is indifferent. 


The concert starts and Superstar does her best but starts to fumble her words through some of her own songs. Pregnant sister brings up her concerns during the intermission but Superstar brushes it off saying it's nothing.


Out in the crowd, Parker realizes she hasnt gone to the bathroom in three days due to her excitement for Superstar. Shoves the poster into Guys hand, making him promise he would try to get Superstars signature when the time comes and runs off to pee.


Parker finds a spot in the bushes and begins her relief. Midway stream, Parker looks at the jumbotron and sees Guy getting  on stage with Superstar? And theres a priest? WTF! Parker is so distraught she stands up . . . And wets her pants. Whoops.


Guy is in Superstars dressing room, trying to comprehend what just happened while Pregnant Sister is freaking out over Superstar. To Superstars defense, she took the MARRY ME sign quite literal and accepted 'Guys proposal' . And who was that priest? Turns out one of fans is a priest and was at the show, so when Superstar asks if anyone could marry them the priest didnt hesitate to come up on stage. Also she just learns guys name is Guy and is like 'really? That's your name?'


Guy and Superstar hear a commotion outside to see Parker arguing with the bouncer how she is Guys BFF and that was *her sign*. Bouncer says 'you smell like piss.' Guy tells Superstar and bouncer Parker is with him and allow her to come back stage. Not after sticking her tongue out at the bouncer for doing his job.


Superstar gives Parker a pair of her own pants which makes Parkers life. Pregnant sister tells Superstar to get a hold of her lawyers to see if she is actually legally married to Guy before showing Superstar how people are talking about her stunt. People started to believe it was planned - the guys name is Guy for heavens sake! Superstar agrees to get a hold of her lawyers but needed to get away from it all - including her manager (over 100 missed calls within 20 minutes of the fiasco)


Superstar, Pregnant sister, Guy, and Parker all load up into her touring bus and head off to the airport to hop into her private jet to Africa - just in time to avoid her manager . .  .who is her DAD! Dun dun dun. 


Dad tracks his daughter's down to the airport and harasses the bus driver to let him know where his daughter's went. The bus driver lies and says Antarctica or the Artic. Some place cold. Dad takes the bait and heads off on his own private jet.


Time passes and the arrive in Africa - a village Superstar donates a bunch of her money towards. The villagers greet Superstar happily when pregnant sister goes hard core into labour, despite it being a few weeks early. Guy steps in, saying he delivered two babies before and even carries around the news paper article.  Superstar reads how he delivered his older sisters baby, twice. On a ferris wheel each time. 


That was the moment Superstar realizes Guy is a good guy, perhaps what she really needs in life.


Baby comes out and they get no longer pregnant sister to a hospital Superstar built with her money. The newborn boy is named Parker after Parker.


Dad finally tracks his daughter's down to Africa and rampages to the hospital to give Superstar a piece of his mind, and they legalities surrounding the marriage. He is also pissed off his first grandsons name is Parker.


The lawyers assemble and tell Superstar the facts. And the fact is her and Guy . . . .are not legally married! Superstars face drops. Deep down she wishes she did legally married Guy.


The six (Superstar, Guy, no longer pregnant sister, Parker, boy Parker, and Dad) fly back to America where Superstar and Guy start a new relationship together.


END.

snvcoq,What is/are your favorite cinematography scene(s)?,17,0.68,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snvcoq/what_isare_your_favorite_cinematography_scenes/,32,"For me it has to be the following moments:

- The [match cut in Lawrence of Arabia](https://youtu.be/0ccB1KTzr9o).

This match cut in the beginning is one of the most impactful cuts i’ve seen in a film. The cut went from a close-up shot of something (T.E. lawrence and the match), to a wide-shot of nothing (the sun and open desert). This creates a composition contrast, but remains interlinked through the absence of a color contrast, because we went from the orange match to the orange desert.

In the first shot we see that T.E. Lawrence has power and control over the heat, because he blows out the match. In the next shot we see that the heat has the power and control, because we see a rising sun over an endless desert. This creates an emotional and physical contrast between T.E. Lawrence and his admiration for the desert.

- The [composition shots in Eyes Wide Shut](https://youtu.be/MIdNBBTBuqM)

These shots are really powerful to me and I can’t get these images out of my head. The shots visualize multiple strong emotions, while maintaining a static image. The camera doesn’t move, the people don’t move and the masks don’t have movement in the facial expressions.

This results in a minimalistic image, which causes the focus to go to the compositions of the characters and the emotions on the masks.


- The [match cut in 2001: A Space Odyssey](https://youtu.be/xkNV_wALoYc)

This match cut is also one of the best I’ve seen in a film. This cut visualizes a jump of 3 million years in just a couple seconds. In the first shot we see a bone that the man-apes used as a weapon to kill eachother. In the next shot we see a nuclear weapon in space that humans could use to kill eachother.

The motion, rotation and location between the bone and nuclear weapon don’t exactly allign during the match cut, causing it to not change smoothly. I interpret this as a visualization to show that evolution within the 3 million years isn’t a smooth process as well.",1644355636.0

socunz,"Iconic moments, props, costumes, scenes etc. in recent movies?",0,0.45,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/socunz/iconic_moments_props_costumes_scenes_etc_in/,25,"Can anyone think of anything from recent movies (let's say the last 10 years) that are original and yet also have that iconic feel of something like the look of Indianna Jones, or the Delorean from *Back to the Future*, or the Xenomorph from *Alien* and the Predator from *Predator*? Or even scenes, like the shower scene in *Psycho*, the opening scene of *Jaws*, or Darth Vader's famous line in *Empire Strikes Back*?

I don't really think superheroes can count as being iconic in and of themselves, because they were arguably iconic *before* their respective franchises, etc.  But I will concede something like the shot of all the Avengers together in New York at the end of *The Avengers* probably fits the bill, because it's something that was born entirely out of the film and is recognisable and therefore somewhat iconic for most people at this point.

I'm struggling to think of anything.

EDIT - I guess I didn't explain my logic with regards to the MCU/superheroes too well, because people keep arguing with me about them. I'm not saying those things aren't iconic, quite the opposite. But they're a given, in the same *Star Wars* is a given, or Bond is a given, etc. These things are massive existing franchises that became iconic long over 10 years ago, and as such are building upon a huge pre-existing audience or off of previously established ideas within the franchise itself.

Also, this isn't meant to be a slight on the quality or merit of these franchises, just that if we didn't rule them out the whole thread would just be people saying ""The Infinity Gaunlet"" or ""Lightsabres"" or whatever. I hope that clarifies. Sorry I wasn't clearer to begin with.",1644411109.0

Also anyone who watches Nightmare Alley would have a hard time arguing that Cate Blanchett wouldn't be an amazing Dr Tenenbaum.

Re-watched it last night. 

I think this is an almost great B-Movie, I think the 3D part was gilding the lilly, wholly unnecessary if not distracting, the flick stands alone without it.

The stand-out here is William Fichtner, he just nails it as the Accountant. The rest of the cast is fine, Nic Cage is Nic Cage. Amber Heard doesn't add much (Rosie O'Donnell would of been more interesting), and Charlotte Ross has a hilarious set piece (where is she these days?). The writing overall is excellent, but Fichtner's performance is the stand-out here, makes the movie.

The experience of watching this film and my feelings on it since are really unlike most any other film I’ve seen the more I think about it.

I pretty much saw it cold, going in. I knew Frances Mcdormand was in it ( who I love) but that was about it.

Throughout watching the film, I’d be lying if I said I was enjoying it, yet was still completely engrossed. I think mainly not knowing the premise or anything about the film and filmmaker it left me openly worried about where the film was heading. Frances’ character felt like at any moment the hammer was going to drop and something horrific was going to happen to her. The suspense of her safety was constantly in play, and I was expecting robbery or even murder at any given moment.

However once the film played out we are given the films overall thesis, the fact that out of all of this strife and hardship that ultimately this was all Frances choice. She chooses this lifestyle and that was a little bit of a sigh of relief knowing she wants this life and not being simply submitted to it out of hardship.

What stuck with me after watching this film was how intellectually honest it managed to be. The film never felt like it was trying to manipulate me into a specific POV, nor did it stoop to cliches or tropes it so easily could have ( nice stranger who turns out to be evil, accosting teenagers and the like) the film was simply confident in its narrative and just sort of goes with it, it doesn’t force anything narratively or any message down our throats. It just IS. 

For that reason that reason the film really stuck with me. I find it so interesting and unique that I almost didn’t enjoy the film while watching it but enjoyed it so much more after the fact.",1644364138.0
smqfky,The Lord of the Rings trilogy spoiled us with its rich dialogue. No other recent blockbuster has come close,3763,0.85,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smqfky/the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy_spoiled_us_with_its/,789,"We all know that the Lord of the Rings trilogy changed blockbuster cinema: In terms of production, special effects and spectacle, it set the standard that blockbusters have followed since. Big armies lining up for battle, huge sets and fantastical vistas, and all manner of CGI monsters and creatures. 

In my opinion, however, no other blockbuster since has even approached having the same sort of elevated, beautiful dialogue we see in LOTR. Mostly taken from Tolkien, but occasionally created whole cloth by Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, the trilogy is littered with beautiful soliloquies, monologues, speeches and diatribes that go well beyond the average Hollywood film and into the realm of high art. 

No other blockbuster since has even attempted to have such elevated, poetic and descriptive prose make up it's dialogue, and that's honestly really tragic. Many of the best scripted moments in the trilogy sound like they could have come straight from a Shakespearean tragedy, and this sort of writing shows you can combine big spectacle with literate prose and still find success with the audience. 

Some examples of my favourite lines from the films:

**The Two Towers**

Gandalf: ""*The veiling shadow that glowers in the East takes shape.  Sauron will suffer no rival! From the summit of Barad-Dur his eye watches ceaslessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; Doubt ever gnaws at him. Rumour has reached him; the heir of Numenor still lives.*""

Gandalf"" *Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth! I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!*""  

Théoden: ""*What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread! If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!*""

**The Return of the King**

Saruman: ""*You have fought many wars and slain many men, Theoden King, and made peace afterwards. Can we not take council as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace?*""

Theoden: ""*We shall have peace... We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they died against the gates of the Hornberg are avenged! When you hang from a gibbit for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace.*”

Denethor: ""*You think you are wise, Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me!*"" 

Gandalf: ""*All has turned to vain ambition! He would even use his grief as a cloak!*""

Theoden: ""*Arise, arise, riders of Théoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world’s ending! Death! Death! Death! Forth Èorlingas!*""

Their costs, while very moderate for a film company, (5 million and 9 million), is actually really huge for a single person. M Night had to refinance his house or some shit to pay for The Visit.

Now those films are box office hits. They grossed 100 mil and 280 mil respectively, but as I know it, he had to find a buyer for the film, find distribution, and no doubt paramount pictures or walt disney or whatever probably took a huge chunk of the profits.

My question is, on a very, very, rough estimate, how much money would you say M Night made from The Visit and Split, given that he had to finance it all himself?

He is accompanied by his friend  Curtin who he made while living rough in the streets of Mexico, and they are led in the expedition by the wise old adventurer Howard, played beautifully by the Director's father, Walter Huston. The movie is only on the surface about gold, and is more a study of what wealth and greed can drive a man to do. Despite the movie having being made more than seventy years ago, it still captured my attention with the wonderful acting and clever plot. just when you feel a plotline is dragging too long they change direction and keep you intrigued with an unexpected twist.  Fred Dobbs' character, brilliantly played by Humphrey Bogart, who bragged that gold would not change him, is probably how any of us would behave if we had the great fortune of winning the lottery, and it is the other two of the team who show their true colors.

Ropes snapping and slicing through flesh, barrels splashing and sliding over decks and rigs, dynamite and gas cylinders, close attention to the inner workings of trains and boats and mines and oil rigs. In ""Jaws"" this ""mechanical"" horror is often more effective than the ""biological"" horror of the shark, IMO. 

I'm not sure if I'm making sense but this depiction of raw, senseless, dehumanising physical forces across the two films was really cool to compare. Things like the beach scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" are similar but, y'know, that's explicitly a war film where brutality is expected. Both ""TWBB"" and ""Jaws"" are of course brutal, but in quite a different way from violent war films.

My man went from playing a down and out quarterback trying to get him a gorgeous lady out of his league, to playing a down and out gambler trying to get him a gorgeous catholic lady way out of his league. The versatility! The acting chops! 

Actually though, absolutely love these two movies and find it awesome and kinda strange he decided to star in two sports films in back to back years. The Replacements has the perfect amount of cheesy inspirational comedy to it, and of course Hardball hits right in the feels and is another great redemption story. Atta boy Neo!",1644377364.0

The animation is gorgeous and I drool over it the entire time. The concepts and ideas at work are really cool and interesting. The aesthetics and design of the whole thing is great. But it just doesn't click.

This is now my second time watching it start to finish. The opening is really great and I love the stuff with the biker gangs. The ending is really excellent and the final confrontation with Tetsuo, Kaneda, and Akira is really cool. It should work but it just doesn't. It feels like there is just this one missing piece  that doesn't tie it all together like it should. 

Maybe it's the characters? I'm not super in love with Tetsuo and Kaneda and their gang. I think what's happening to Tetsuo is horrific and shocking and I can sympathize with him probably more than anyone else, but there's nothing to latch onto. I'm not rooting for anyone in the end. I would love to hear other's thoughts about Akira so I can work on fleshing out my own.

Below is the original post with updates in **bold** (except for the headings) Here was the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/r6pcv0/last_january_my_friends_and_i_picked_the_best/) just so you can see we didn't cheat ;)


We love movies and thought it would be fun to look back on our picks once the official noms come out. Stumbled upon the word doc last week and wanted to see how our predictions were holding up so far and I thought this community might enjoy it. 

We *only* looked at the name of the film, the cast/director attached at the time, the studio, and one to two sentences about the plot. It's interesting seeing how off we were on some and how we actually weren't too wrong on some others. I also included some data from the last 27 years of Best Picture winners: RT critic score, RT audience score, and the average of those two numbers to compare to how the films are looking compared to past winners.

For those interested in the historical info from Forrest Gump to Nomadland:

The average RT critic score over the past 27 films has been **88.2%**, the audience score **86.3%**, with the average of those two numbers being **87.3%**. I used those numbers as a loose talking point when discussing how I think a movie might do in the Best Picture nom race. 

Just for shits and gigs, the lowest rated critic scored film to win Best Picture in the last 27 years was *Forrest Gump* with a rough 71% critic score. But it made up for it with a resounding 95% audience score to average out to 83%. Still decently below the average of all Best Picture winners, but still higher than some other winners (Braveheart 82%, Gladiator 82%, Crash 81%, and the Shape of Water 82%).

The lowest rated audience scored film to win Best Picture in the same time frame was *Titanic* with 69% audience score, *nice*. It landed at 89% with critics to put it at an average of 79% (if you trust the RT numbers on slightly dated films). If you believe the numbers, this is the ""worst"" Best Picture winner in the last 27 years.


# Ok now on to the post


We divided our picks into 3 categories:

* **Surely to get consideration**

* **Might get some strong looks**

* **Dark Horses**

# Surely to get consideration

* *Cantebury Glass* (New Regency) delayed to 2022: We didn't even know the plot to this one, but it had Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Robert De Niro, Timothy Olyphant, Rami Malek, and even the great Mike Myers signed on with Oscar winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Birdman, Children of Men, the Revenant, Gravity). Sounded like a Best Picture recipe to us. Unfortunately, the film has been pushed back to a 2022 release so we'll have to wait a bit to see if this one delivers.

* *The French Dispatch* (Searchlight Pictures) 74% critic, 76% audience, 75% average: Looking back on our list, we were really hot on Searchlight for some reason as this is the first of four films from the studio we would list. A Wes Anderson film with Benicio Del Toro, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, and Timothee Chalamet. Seemed like it could be one to sneak in with some solid reviews and snag a nom. Unfortunately it underperformed and doesn't seem like it's in the running for a nom. I think we got a little too excited with the cast and thought Anderson may pull out the Isle of Dogs (90% critics, 87% audience) and Grand Budapest Hotel (92% critic, 86% audience) magic, but sadly it was not the case.

+ *House of Gucci* (UA) 62% critic, 83% audience, 72.5% average: lol. We got baited so hard by this one. Good director, great cast, interesting plot/setting. This film had crazy potential on paper. It would be the lowest rated critic and average score to win Best Picture if it somehow did, but I don't think it will get a nom at this point.

+ *Nightmare Alley* **Ayyy got one right!** (Searchlight) releasing in theaters 12/17: One guy in our group was a big del Toro fan and the cast was surprisingly heavy. Plot sounded just ""OK"" but it was early and there wasn't much detail out there. This one has a shot at nom, but what worries me is that we are a couple weeks out from release and have yet to see any reviews from advanced screenings. Macbeth is even further out and we are already getting glowing reviews coming in from early screenings. This film not being shown off early is a little concerning to me honestly, and I won't be shocked if it has a mild release and misses a nom.

+ *The Tragedy of Macbeth* **This one seems like the closest thing to a snub this season** (A24) 98% critic, releasing 12/25: Speaking of Macbeth, this was a no brainer back at the start of the year. Joel Coen, Denzel Washington (darling), Frances McDormand (darling), with an epic story. This was one of the easiest ones to add to the list and there as pretty much no debate among our group at all. Early reviews are crushing it. If the audience reviews are even remotely decent (82%+ range) I think this one is a lock for a Best Picture nom.

+ *West Side Story* **We got lucky and picked the right musical this year** (20th Century) releasing 12/10: Spielberg remaking an all-time classic musical in a time when musicals are the hottest they've been in several decades. Wasn't much more to say. A little worried that official reviews aren't out yet on a movie that releases in 9 days, but we'll see. There are some tweets from an early showing that are being thrown around, but early tweets are almost always promotional gumbly goo. If it lands on solid footing, it may have to compete with *In the Heights*, which had a very strong showing (but more on that later), for a Best Picture nom. At the start of the year we were confident it would be this one, but we may have it reversed.

+ *C'mon, C'mon* (A24) 95% critic, 83% audience, 89% average: We initially picked this one based on the Joaquin and A24 pairing combined with, what we thought, was an Oscar-baiting premise. Turns out we might have been right. Movie is crushing it with critics and doing solid with audiences too. It's falling in close to that ""winner"" range of scores that we've seen in the past, so I'm still expecting a nom for this one.

+ *Dune* **Not too shabby** (Warner Bros) 83% critic, 90% audience, 86.5% average: Our group had a pretty decent love of sci-fi and fantasy so we were really hoping this one lived up to the hype. It was kind of a roll of the dice when we were discussing this. It was back early in the year so there wasn't even a full trailer yet, just lots and lots of hype. We thought it would either bust or blow it wide open. Turns out it kind of landed in the middle. The audience score is really strong and is higher than that of many past winners, might not be enough though in a year with some solid candidates. It still might get a Best Picture nom (it will surely get them in other categories), but I'm not too optimistic on that. If the second one delivers on all the payoff that the first film has setup, it's possible we see a Lord of the Rings situation where the sequel ends up catching all the praise for the whole series and Dune 2 could walk away big.

+ *The Last duel* **I think the bad press and the release timing screwed this one** (20th Century) 85% critic, 81% audience, 83% average: At first glance this seemed like a no-brainer. Great cast, director, and premise. For whatever reason it just didn't pan out and now it's sitting with below average scores for a Best Picture winner and lots of bad press due to comments from the Director. I can still see it snagging a nom just because of the cast and director, but I would be utterly disappointed if it won.

# Might get some strong looks

These were our presumed 2nd tier contenders. Probably weren't going to snag a nom unless some films in the top tier goofed up (and they did). It's also the category we were off the most on.

+ *Annette* (Amazon) 71% critic, 76% audience, 73.5% average: We thought Amazon might return to their Sound of Metal and Manchester by the Sea glory, and hell if Casey Affleck could lead them to nom than surely Adam Driver could. That was the basis of our discussion. at least. We missed the mark on this one big. No nom in sight for this one sadly.

+ *Blonde* (Netflix) Delayed to 2022: A Marilyn Monroe biopic with Ana de Armas and Adrien Brody. Had *potential* on paper and it felt just like the kind of movie Netflix could release that get some real critical praise. Add in being produced by Brad Pitt and we thought we would have a winner. Sadly we won't get to know until next year as it has been delayed. 

+ *The Eyes of Tammy Faye* (Searchlight) 66% critic, 87% audience, 76.5% average: Great cast with a really interesting premise that seemed like was a perfect storm to snag a nom. Unfortunately it just didn't pan out. Audiences liked it fine, but with reviews from critics like those it's unlikely to sniff a Best Picture nom.

+ *In the Heights* **Took a gamble on West Side Story over this one** (Warner Bros) 94% critic, 94% audience, 94% average: Believe it or not this one was actually hard to place for us. On one hand Lin-Manuel Miranda is super hot right now, and on the other hand it's a musical and we thought that people might have Hamilton fatigue and not give this one its due. We were way off. Destroying critic and audience reviews, this one should have been in the highest tier and it seems maybe only West Wide Story could keep it from snagging a Best Picture nom (solely because I don't see two musicals occupying Best Picture slots in the same year).

+ *Next Goal Wins* (Searchlight) Delayed to 2022: A comedy by Taika Waititi with Michael Fassbender, Rachel House, and Armie Hammer about the American Samoa futbol team suffering the worst loss ever (31-0). Seemed like it might slip into the Jojo Rabbit niche of films and snag a nom if the cards fell just right. Now that it's delayed and with all the Armie Hammer stuff out there it might not happen (and obv not this year).

+ *Stillwater* (Focus) 74% critic, 72% audience, 73% average: Matt Damon working with Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) on a unique story seemed like the type of film to sneak in a Best Picture nom. It just didn't hit all the right boxes with fans and critics alike and likely won't be getting a nom even though there's a little room at the top.

# The Dark Horses

These were films that we thought may surprise in a big way and make a run. Actually ended up being one of our stronger categories as it stands now.

+ *The Courier* (Lionsgate) 85% critic, 95% audience, 90% average: Benedict has been everywhere, and while we didn't have it pegged as a sure thing this film is looking like it's in a really strong place for a Best Picture nom. Respectable 85% from critics and a mega missile of an 95% audience score. If there's room at the top, pencil this one in as your Dark Horse. Might be too crowded to find room, but I think Courier has better odds than others on the list.

+ *King Richard* **Always feels good when a dark horse pops off** (Warner Bros) 91% critic, 98% audience, 94.5% average: I'm a huge tennis fan and was really the only one making a case for this film early on. Couldn't justify putting it any higher at the time; we just felt the Will Smith star power wasn't quite there anymore and were hesitant on people being interested in the Williams' story with wanning interest in Serena and Venus. But man this one landed fast and hard. Smith killed it, and this one is absolutely on track for a Best Picture nom. Can't even consider this one a Dark Horse anymore.

+ *Red, White, and Water* (A24) delayed to 2022: We threw this one in as a dark horse based on Jennifer Lawrence and the plot. A US soldier suffers a traumatic brain injury while fighting in Afghanistan and struggles to adjust to life back home. Probably going to be a bust....but just maybe co- nah, in hindsight this was probably a bad pick, but at least I can't say we were wrong since it's getting delayed until 2022 >:]

+ *Respect* (UA) 67% critic, 95% audience, 81% average: This was the kind of movie that, on paper, had potential to make a run if the cards fell right. The story of Aretha Franklin starring Jennifer Hudson and Forest Whitaker. Films about music icons are big right now, so it had a path to a nom. Things just didn't pan out, and though audiences loved it, it's likely not getting a Best Picture nom.

+ *Soggy Bottom* aka *Licorice Pizza*  **Two from this category, not too shabby** (UA) 92% critic, 98% audience, 95% audience: Undergoing a name change just a couple months ago, this film hit the ground running and is now a sure bet for a Best Picture nom. Paul Thomas Anderson with a coming of age film set in the 70's. It was enough to bait me into labeling it a dark horse back in January and it seems the bet paid off. 


# Films we absolutely missed 

+ *The Power of the Dog*  **Great film, probably our biggest miss** (Netflix) 95% critic, 77% audience, 86% average: Not sure why this wasn't on our radar. Maybe it wasn't on the list we looked at or maybe the name just led us astray and kept us from looking further into it because we thought it was dog or children's movie. Regardless, this film is making waves and I won't be surprised if it gets a best picture nom.

+ *Belfast*  **Another big miss** (Focus) 87% critic, 92% audience, 89.5% average: We weren't too hyped on this one when we saw it come up at the start of the year honestly. It didn't seem that exciting but it seems like it pulled a reverse Mank (which was enjoyed by critics but loathed by audiences with a 83% critic score and 59% audience score) and is getting solid praise across the board. Probably going to snag a Best Picture nom.

+ *Coda* **Wasn't on our radar, but truly an awesome movie** (Apple) 96% critic, 93% audience, 94.5% average: Holy smokes this one came out of nowhere to us. A relatively unknown cast and a director mostly known for her writing, Coda is getting incredible reviews from all sides and is likely snagging Apple a Best Picture nom.

+ *Tick, Tick... BOOM!* **Kind of falling in snub range to me now** (Netflix) 88% critic, 95% audience, 91.5% average: This one also caught us by surprise. Andrew Garfield taking the screen by storm. Directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the third possible musical that could snag a Best Picture nom. It's a tough year to be a musical competing for Oscars. Could Netflix end up with two of the Best Picture noms?


+ **Don't Look Up - Honestly not sure this deserves a nom, but here it is. Think some other films on the list were more deserving like Macbeth and Tick, Tick, Boom!**
+ **Drive My Car - Haven't seen nor heard much about it, so not surprising we missed on it. Will check it out soon though**


+ **Honestly it's kind of funny. We guessed (in some capacity) 5 of the 10 noms a year out based solely on the names attached to the projects. Not a terrible outcome if you're a gambler. Although a 50% is a failure pretty much everywhere you go. What do you guys think?**

So yeah we missed the mark on a couple and missed several completely but overall it was fun seeing how things shaped out based on the little info we had at the start of the year. Anything catch you guys by surprise? You have big whiff like we did?",1644331990.0

 Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called ""Wayne's World"" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of ""Wayne's World""—and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast—as well as the wild pop-culture references—make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie.

I can't deny how much I like this movie and I praise it for Whannell's directing style especially with his use of colors and darkness in Invisible Man. I know Whannell is probably known better for horror movies such as Insidious and Saw, but I was surprised to learn that Upgrade was getting a TV series and that he was directing a reboot for Escape from New York. I'm currently wondering when is Upgrade's TV show gonna air because I'm curious to see what direction Whannell goes in for this.

As a Whannell fan, I've been wondering if he would do some more action movies like James Wan. I would love to see him work with franchises such as Jump Street, Jason Bourne, Fast and Furious. Although I wonder if this could limit his creativity in contrast to Wan's considering the fact Wan not only worked and co created Insidious and Saw with him, but also helmed Furious 7 and Aquaman. Regardless of franchise or independent work, I was just wondering how do most of you feel about Whannell as an action director especially concerning Upgrade?

It seems there are many actors who were considered great and highly acclaimed at one time, but for whatever reason aren't as well remembered as some of their contemporaries. Two actors that come to mind are Paul Muni and Robert Donat. Both actors were similar to Daniel Day-Lewis due to the fact that both were academy award winning actors known for disappearing into their roles and considered the greatest actors from their time period. Both did not have a large filmography. Muni only did 23 films and Donat did only 20 films. 

Another example from later on was Montgomery Clift a great actor (with only 17 films) who seems to have suffered a similar fate since both Marlon Brando and James Dean (despite only starring in 3 films) appear more well known today than him. Clift was also considered the first true method actor to appear in films so it's kind of sad that actors who followed in his footsteps have eclipsed him.

 Both Muni and Donat are rarely mentioned or talked about even among classic film fans especially compared to their contemporaries like James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney. One would think their reputation and carefulness with selecting film roles would have been enough to keep their legacies thriving, but that didn't seem to be the case. One wonders if Day-Lewis will suffer a similar fate in the future.",1644311419.0

I finally went and watched House of Gucci yesterday with a couple of friends.

Full background: I’m Italian, born and raised in northern Italy in the late 80s, then moved to Germany 10 years ago.

I don’t know if it was nostalgia but I LOVED the movie. From the very beginning when the waiter drops 5000 Lire of change to the accents and the constant switching between Italian and English.

The language: it doesn’t make any sense, I get it. But it’s so entertaining. Someone said that the accent is not correct. What do they mean? It’s a complete fantasy, of course no Italian would speak like that. Because they’d speak Italian! But it’s immensely entertaining. Especially coming from older great starts like Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons. Even Jared Leto, I loved every instant where he’s on screen.

Adam driver and lady Gaga are so good at what they’re doing that I completely fell into the love story and forgot that >!shes gonna kill him!<.

In the end Ridley Scott is a 84 years old director that makes movies like no other. And I deeply enjoy them (I loved The Last Duel as well)

so6rjd,I enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express (2017) but...,0,0.28,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/so6rjd/i_enjoyed_murder_on_the_orient_express_2017_but/,7,"I believe when any story is adapted to another medium it becomes its own story, and yet Kenneth Branagh's version of one of Christie's best detectives is a bit too far. Agatha Christie is most renowned for her stories that explored the souls and passions of people however the retelling spends too much time and emphasis on evidence.

I thoroughly enjoy the movie and think it's very well done, but I struggle with my enjoyment of the source material (which I equally, if not more, enjoy) and this telling on the focus of evidence vs motive. I struggle because the message is different, when focused on evidence it is merely a mystery, however when focused on the people it is a story played out that can be experienced, no reader thinks themselves Poirot, but they find a different character among the suspects. In the movie they connect with only the sleuth (Poirot) trying to solve the murder.

TLDR; enjoyed the movie very much but curious why/how they got so far from the original focus of people vs evidence",1644388242.0

Being the first sequel (or requel) in 10 years I figured something was going to tie from the original and cap it off. 

That something was Stu from the first film and boy did Scream 5 set that up only to not do it. Stu returning fits with the original scrapped sequel idea of him having new killers under him while jailed and it fits with what a long returning sequel or end film would do. Instead it looks like we are just getting Scream 6.

5 did so much stuff you would do in a last film except having the last final big moment. Meta statement on original returning, Billy's daughter and the hallucinations, Stu's house being the last location, the death of a legacy character, and Gales refusal to write anymore about the crimes. Dewey dieing to Stu or atleast because of Stu is way better and Gale possibly stopping future killers with not sensationalizing it is a great way to put an end on the series and yet its not the end.

All we needed was Stu to be mentoring the two psychos, face off with Sydney, and die with others not being written about. Great ending! And I really thought he was gonna pop out until the very end.

If six is our end (which it basically has to be) I feel like they wasted so much good end game stuff. 

The only avenue I see left is to dive into the idea of a series getting old and no one caring anymore, which could act as an end. But it of course needs old Sydney and Stu. 

I dont care that it's predictable now. Scream has done a great job with its sequels compared to other horror franchises and I would hate to see it not go out on its own terms.",1644371947.0

There’s a lot of characters, scenes move back and forth in time and while there’s some exposition it’s limited. If you’re not paying attention it’s easy to get lost. It’s not a flashy film, it reveals itself slowly over time. It’s funny to think that technically this and a Bond movie would be both considered spy films, because it’s so far from the theatrics of those films. No gadgets, no campy villain, no countdown timer to a bomb about to explode. It feels like what real spy craft would be like. Slow, methodical and low key. 

All of the above is also why it gets better with multiple viewings. The direction is really well considered and confident. The connections between the characters get clearer with multiple viewings. Of course the performances are sublime which is no surprise given the cast.

So I was shocked to see it didn’t get a best picture nomination. Even in a year which had the longer nomination list. This is absolutely an Oscar worthy film IMO and I hope it continues to gain more regard over time.

He replied, stating that they're merely entertaining and apart from Alien are all irrelevant. He also compared the fans of these movies to normies who watch the MCU. Which I guess is offensive to both sides.

The guy ended his rant stating that quality was forgone many years ago, with the 80's flooding the market with ""teen intellect level effects movies"". I reminded him that tastes are subjective and he shouldn't be the one to make the judgement call as everyone has different standards.

The cinematography from Claudia Becerril Bulos is especially amazing; with lots of landscape photography and an amazing use of depth of field. As the movie progresses, the cinematography and general presentation gets more surreal.

The story primarily deals with the horror that the cartel has been inflicting on Mexico with a focus on the violence in the borderlands.

If I made my own space opera film, it would be a small group of space mercenaries flying around in a Millennium Falcon inspired freighter. They would be known as The Marauders. This franchise would also have a big toyline featured many action figures, vehicles, and a few playsets. The titles of these films would be:

The Marauders 

The Mauraders: Shadows of Warfare 

The Marauders: Unifying Force

The Maruaders members would consist of a flame thrower specialist named Kyle Savo, a talented teenage engineer and medic named Emily Veronis, an elite sniper named Bryce Kiness, a heavy weapons expert named Amadeus Xizor.

Kyle Savo worked for the evil Zeta Empire and was a flame trooper that went rogue (kinda like Finn from the sequels). He steals an experimental suit of advanced armor with a built in heat beam canon. He is a psychopath that loves jazz, much like Io Flemming from Gundam Thunderbolt.

Emily Veronis was an orphaned child who had her planet conquered and she was tortured and experimented on by the Zeta Empire. They eventually tampered with her genetic make up with a highly intelligent alien species, which caused her mutate and gain some physical characteristics of that species as well as some new abilities, most notably super intelligence. She used this to her advantage to escape and stop the mutation from spreading. With her intelligence she crafts many advanced and complex technologies and is immensely knowledgeable with medicine and machinery. She is agile, however she is physically weak. She also struggles with self acceptance after what she has experienced. 

Bryce Kiness is the leader of the group and captain of the the freighter. He is doesn't like to go guns and blazes when he isn't  flying his ship, and has a calm and humble personality. He is a former bounty hunter for the Republic but quit after realizing after all fo the horrible atrocities they have committed.

Amadeus Xizor worked with Bryce as a bounty hunter and copilot. He is a trigger happy individual and gets angry very easily. However deep inside he really cares for his allies.

As for the politics, the galaxy's core government is a republic similiar to Star Wars. Decades before the events of the Maruaders Trilogy, the Zeta Empire waged war in hopes of conquering the entire galaxy. The empire was defeated, but they were given a decent amount of the galaxy to rule for themselves. A few years before the events of the first Mauraders movie the Republic gets more and more paranoid of the empire that they start committing violent atrocities to their planets in order to maintain control.

Meanwhile, the Empire has been preparing for another war in their area and started to rely on Red Abyss, a criminal organization with the most advanced technology in the galaxy, lead by the crim lord Kannos Zenith. Seeing how the galaxy's republic is in turmoil they use this chance to strike with sheer force, capturing some planets in the process. There are no good guys or bad guys in the story, just two horribly corrupt governments. The Maruaders are hired for the Republic but as they go through and adventures, they see that both sides are corrupt, they realize war is a gray area. 

Towards the end of the trilogy, The Marauders find out that Red Abyss is giving supplies to the Republic as well, and at this point Red Abyss becomes so powerful that they betray both the Zeta Empire and the Republic with their incredible weapons and technology far more advanced than the Zeta Empire or the Republic. The two governments make the difficult decision to join forces and take out this greater evil in a final battle on the Red Abyss's home planet, with The Maruader leading the operation. As the fleets of the Zeta Empire, Republic, and Red Abyss rip each other to shreds, The Mauraiders raid the Red Abyss headquarters and have an intense final battle with the Kannos who is armed to the teeth to take on the heroes.

After the battle, the war comes to a close, and the Zeta Empire and Republic merge into a Galactic Federation in order to maintain peace. The Maruaders decide to live together aboard their freighter, and together they become ambassadors of the Federation.

It was one of the most beautiful things that I'd ever seen, and its really stuck with me.  I feel like theres a whole untapped universe of amazing Bollywood ridiculousness that I've not even begun to mine, but I don't know where to start.  One time I did some googling of the best most ridiculous Bollywood action movies and I got some recommendations but then I couldn't figure out where to watch them.  I normally check torrent sites first and if a movie isn't on there I rent it from Googleplay.  But none of these Bollywood movies were available on either place.  


So I'm turning to you for help, reddit.  In case anyone else is a connoisseur of these fine, enlightened cinematic adventures.  Where can I find these hidden masterpieces?  Any help is appreciated, thanks!",1644364223.0
snpp2l,Please help me find this movie about puppies,0,0.38,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snpp2l/please_help_me_find_this_movie_about_puppies/,3,"I remember watching this movie as a kid so my description might be really vague.I will try to list a few details I remember.

I think there are about 7 puppies(not exactly sure about the number).

The puppies do not have same owners I believe(the owners of these puppies were 2 neighboring families)

One detail I remember is that during the film the dogs can speak our language( well i am sure they go woof woof and  they are just voiced in our language.I am not sure if that made any sense)

In the beginning when they all meet at their usual hang out place,one of the puppy wanders off chasing something(i guess).Then these other puppies see him and go after him.

There also some bad guys who try to steal these puppies in between 

Also it is not an animated film

I am not even sure if this is an English film as I watched it dubbed in my native language(telugu)

As for how old this movie is I watched this movie on DVD so probably 1900s or early 2000s

I am not a native English speaker so please let me know if you don't understand anything I wrote i will try to get my point across to you

Why?

First off, why wouldn't he say, ""She is alive"" if he is implying that Eloise will see her, or that ""She the one who killed"", based on the fact that he views that house as ""hell"", which I'm assuming has to do with the possibility that he investigated the murders/disappearance of the men.

More importantly, why would he imply Alex killed Sandy? Eloise can see ghosts, but I felt like it's such a stretch to include the ghost of Sandy, who is a metaphor for the countless ""deaths"" she endured, let alone that the detective (who the only show them speaking once), also understands the metaphorical deaths of Sandy?

The entire movie is based on th facts that she can see/become ghost/travel in time (I actually don't know) and the ghost she sees, isn't actually dead (also, why the false vision when everything else was real?).

Personally, I would have had it so the viewer thought they were seeing the ghost of Sandys life up until her ""death"", where Eloise would wake up and be to afraid to sleep in the house to see the end of the murder. Eventually she would return, which would then reveal that Sandy was alive and was actually seeing through the eyes of Jack, who wants revenge for his murder.

Don't get me wrong, Wag the Dog is a great movie, and he doesn't really ruin the movie at all (especially given he's only in it for about 5 minutes), it's just...

I don't know...

His casting felt a little off to me? Like the character was written as a more ""smooth, charismatic figure"" yet he was still doing his abrasive shtick? Like he sounded less like he was genuinely excited about all the marketing opportunities the fake war could bring and more like he was pretending to be excited but was about to strangle DeNiro and Hoffman?

I don't know, it felt more like a character Robert Downey Jr. or Eddie Murphy should be playing than Denis Leary.

It didn't really matter, though, because everyone else was cast well, especially Willie Nelson in the same scene. And Leary did play a macho news producer in a similar political satire, The Second Civil War, the same year. And he was great in that and it was also a more fitting character for him in my opinion.",1644356399.0

I had 3 CD which had scenes like this:-

* Dennis nedry is getting killed by baby dinosaur (Jurassic park)

* Neo fighting against Smith clones (matrix reloaded)..... Tom & Jerry one

* Neo vs Mr Smith final (matrix revolutions)

I remember liking Neo vs smith clone fight scene a lot.... ( I was like 7/8)

The depth of this movie has flooded my mind.

Its a story of Evil ( Crowe ) and Good ( Bale ) journey together to earn redemption. 

They both have sons. Evils son is Prince ( Foster ) and Goods son is a young boy. 

Both sons are chasing their fathers through out the movie. Following their foot steps. 

Both have different views of their father. Prince loves Evil and doesn’t question his guidance. The young boy thinks of his father as a loser but is devoted. 

Prince starts the film in this pure white outfit and by the end its bloody and filthy. Being murdered by his leader Evil. Showing his white clothes turn dark is an awesome way to explain blind devotion leads to corrupting of purity. While the young boy who questioned his fathers ways witnesses his father die a hero and redeems his view of him. 

Good and Evil form a bond as well. Good learns from Evil there is no right or wrong only success or failure. Evil leans from Good hope exists and by helping Good complete his mission Evil can redeem himself. Both are seeking inner peace through redemption.

My wife and I recently saw West Side Story. (There are plot spoilers, but only for this movie)

We did a rewatch if the original one and then watched the new one. We left satisfied, but we were thinking: yeah the plot is ultimately kinda dumb. I mean, a 24 hrs love story where she forgives him for murdering her own brother, it doesn't quite make sense.

But you know, you don't watch musicals for tight plotlines and credible characters.

Still, we started thinking of all the musicals we know, and we couldn't find a single one that had a credible, sound, and interesting plot, despite most of them being pretty enjoyable.

Grease has an incredibly dumb story, Moulin Rouge was heartbreaking when I was a teenager, now it's cringey and stupid. Rocky Horror, well, that movie kinda strives on the absurdity of the story, so... And I love all three of those musicals, mind you.

snkroj,Brokeback Mountain Mandala Effect?,0,0.41,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/snkroj/brokeback_mountain_mandala_effect/,13,"I was discussing a legitimate fear I have of blowing up tyres with my partner this evening and told him the fear stemmed from watching brokeback mountain when I was younger and specifically watching the scene where Jack dies when a tyre explodes in his face, exactly as his wife explains it to happen. I specifically remember her explaining it and it cutting to him in the desert changing/blowing up a tyre and it exploding in his face and killing him. 
I also remember and have seen the scene on YouTube and it only ever shows Ennis imagining that Jack was actually murdered by Homophobes during the phone call with jacks wife, and not the alternate scene that I'm remembering, which showed both horrific death scenarios. 
I've tried searching everywhere for this scene the way I remember it but can't find anything even remotely close to it, let alone a singular video of anyone dying this way. 
Did I make this scene up in my head? Is it a Mandala Effect?? Does anyone else specifically remember seeing him die both ways? 
My partner thinks I dreamt it up and the dream was realistic enough to make me think it actually happened in the movie, which isn't that far-fetched, but I don't think I would have been so traumatised by it had it just been a dream.. 
Please tell me I'm not the only one that remembers this scene!

I saw movies which are racist or sexist or homophobic - but I think this is the first time that a film manages to be excellent in all of these categories.

Seriously, this movie tries it's very best to show a world with as many ways to put people into  categories as possible. ""Fag"" and ""faggot"" are common language, there are supposed-to-be-funny rants about a chinese exchange student who is ALWAYS introduced with a loud gong sound when shown (like wtf). Stupid Molly Ringwald is all whining about not getting laid but at the same is right on a bitch to a guy who wants the same, and we are supposed to identify with her? Sure, 16 years olds mostly just want to get laid but this movie cherishes this superficial way of thinking instead of saying like ""Look how stupid we were as teens"". Hell, it even ends with a passed out girl who is traded by his boyfriend against a pair of underwear so the horny ""geek"" can sleep-creep (aka rape) her - that's seriously how it is!

I can't even believe I'm writing a rant post - especially after Ringwald herself spoke out against the film ([https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink)). But I couldn't just let my rage go to nothing and not use it to remind that we've come a long way since teen comedies back then. And that John Hughes may be one of the great filmmakers - but also made some real pieces of shit.

smzztd,(Spoilers) When Harry Met Sally Soundtrack on Prime,8,0.67,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smzztd/spoilers_when_harry_met_sally_soundtrack_on_prime/,4,"Hi guys. Has anyone had the opportunity to watch When Harry Met Sally on Amazon Prime? If you haven't, I really wouldn't bother. 

That's not a mark against When Harry Met Sally, either. This is truly one of the best films of all time. But for whatever reason, most probably licencing, the soundtrack to this film is altered on Amazon Prime. This may be the case on other streaming services, too. 

The most egregious case of this is the absence of Frank Sinatra's 'It Had To Be You' at the film's most pivotal moment between Harry and Sally. In its place is a jazz number, which might be enjoyable were it not for its terrible misuse here. This, please beware of spoilers here, is the famous scene of Harry confessing his love for Sally. 

I am totally struck by how much of an effect this change has when viewing with the knowledge of the original song. I'd be interested to see a person's emotional reaction to the scene whose first time seeing it is via Amazon, yet so far when recommending to friends I've been sure to steer them clear of the Amazon version. 

Why this change has been made, I do not know. Licencing seems the obvious answer, yet this confuses more; with the greatest of respect, the music of Frank Sinatra is widely heard in films ranging from the fantastic to the mediocre, high budget to low budget. Why one of the greatest films of all time, which arguably has the greatest use of Sinatra's music in all of cinema, would have to change its soundtrack in this way is beyond me. More baffling still is the completely uninspiring replacement. After looking it up I've seen very little commentary on this change, and certainly none from director Rob Reiner himself. I imagine, and have to believe, Reiner had no input on this decision. 

Anyways, has anyone else noticed this? Furthermore, does anyone know of any similar examples of soundtrack changes which completely alter the emotional impact of a scene/film?",1644265672.0

And it is also a zombie movie way out of the ordinary; it is set in Africa, something you don't see every day. But if you have read David Wellington's ""Monster"" trilogy, then you will love this movie.

Let me say that the African setting was really a nice breath of fresh air in the zombie genre. It worked so well, because it was miles after miles of savanna and badlands. No big skyscrapers here, no high-tech underground facilities, no narrow and winding dark alleys. A couple of villages though, so it was cool.

However, one thing that puzzled me in ""The Dead"" was the amount of zombies that were shambling about in the savanna. I would have assumed that there wouldn't be that many walking around in the middle of nowhere. Near the villages, yes, but in the middle of the savanna, no! And oddly enough every time the two main characters in the movie stopped somewhere, there were suddenly (and always!) a group of zombies shambling in to attack them. That was so stupid. But I guess it was the simplest way to work in a heap of zombies into the story.

Basically the story revolves around two people only. But it works out well enough, despite the movie moving ahead at a fairly slow speed. But that was not a bad thing, because the movie was far from boring. Just don't expect speed, action and lots of adrenalin, though.

The cast in ""The Dead"" was nice and they did good jobs with their roles. And the two lead roles were well cast.

One thing that could have improved the movie for me, was if the zombies had glazed over milky eyes instead of those weird white eyes; it just didn't really make them have that classic zombie/dead person look. But hey, it was a minor thing. It is just me that pays attention to the small details.

All in all, ""The Dead"" was really a great movie and it was really nice to see this type of approach to the zombie genre. So thumbs up for the movie makers. And if you are a zombie aficionado like me, then you definitely want to check out ""The Dead"".",1644276111.0

It’s one of my favorite types of movies and books , and I love when juxtaposition is utilized.    Some writers say: “wow them in the end” and this movie really hit home in its last line: “We Had Everything”.    Which is so true of today: we have smart phone (well smart everything). Families can be who they want.  We have freedom to choose our paths in life.  And the movie taught us to look at the smaller thing we take for granted— Albeit an old lesson but it’s one we tend to forget and need reminders for.  And this movie did just that.  “We had coffee” .  It was kinda a perfect way to end that scene and the movie overall. .  It was warm and heartfelt; the line was delivered perfectly by our lead.

It is still a bit of a kitchen sink setting regardless.

There's been major influence going back and forward in time as some factions in the story do count with plate armour and longswords while others don't and I'm aware that that kind of equipment came later, more around the 15th to 16th century .

Henry V (1944 and 1989, also a bit modern in setting)

Joan of Arc (1948, The Trial of 1962, The Messenger 1999, the other 1999 one, The Passion of 1928, Joan the Maid 1 & 2 1994)

However, I am unable to find if there was directorial intention with using the Lambda Lambda Lambda Fraternity (a mostly Black American fraternity) as the segue in which the Nerds would eventually rise to stand up against their persecution.


We can even see in Gilbert and Lewis’s speech at the end of the film parallels being made between the hardships of Black Americans during the Civil Rights Movement and now the Nerds nearly 20 years later, and the African Americans are there to defend the Nerds because they are very much aware of the actual difficulty of persecution.


To summarize, I want to know if you think that this was an intentional directorial consideration to acknowledge real systemic issues in America, or if this just happens to be a compelling coincidence. It would be impressive if it was an intentional move, especially in an otherwise raunchy comedy classic.

It's getting really absurd. In the past, Most Action stars, save for Arnold Schwarzenegger who was a professional bodybuilder, looked normal. I mean, of course they were fit and stuff, but their physiques were obtainable. Nowadays, they look like they want to compete on Bodybuilding competitions. Plus, in many cases it's obvious, that they take steroids.

Obviously the writing is on point, but for me there was an ""aha"" moment about halfway through the film that ties back into the title of the movie (I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but think of ""Moonfall"" as two words instead of one). Really smart stuff there, I enjoy when a director trusts his audience to connect the dots on their own.

I loved the symbolism in the film as well. It's subtle, but you can really see how Roland wanted to create an allegory for our modern times when our heroes are dodging asteroids in their Mercedes SUV (Who among us hasn't been there these last two years)

Patrick Wilson and Halle Berry are in top form here with their back and forth banter. Just top notch banter. Can't say enough good things about their banter. I know its early in the year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar nod for one or both of them.

As you probably must know, end credits weren’t a thing before the 1970s or so (as they managed to put their entire staff in the opening credits instead) so the movies always just had a simple ""The End"" screen. Usually it’d go like this: final shot - music swells - ""The End"" screen - music stops - screen goes black - movie’s over. It’s a pretty perfect formula to finish a movie in a glorious way and streaming services completely fuck that over.

I want those last few moments of a movie to sink in, but before the final title appears they already start bombarding the screen with some other crap I need to see. It feels anticlimactic and kills the momentum entirely. I remember seeing Psycho on Netflix and they didn’t even let them pulling the car out of the lake before already recommending me the sequel. It’s such a small thing, but it frustrates me every time. 

I get that streaming services are usually not made for old films, but cmon, am I the only one who is bothered by this? I mean, with superhero films they always wait till the last credit scene before starting with the recommendations, so why not do the same thing with old films? Just wait five seconds more and the ending will be much more satisfying. I hope at least *one* streaming service will fix that someday. Until then I’ll just have to rely on physical media.

Best Actor: I'd love if Rex, Phoenix, Cage, and Dinklage made it but none are happening now.

Best Actress: where to begin here? was Praying Stewart, Haim, and Reineve would all make it but only one likely will, in a very awesome world we'd see Comer, Rousseau, and Thompson all contending as well as Cruz.

Best Supporting Actor: hoping Cooper, Faist, Affleck, Leto, and Pacino much more over Hinds are five but most likely the last two might be our alone contenders, in a perfect awesome world would love to maybe have a Lindon nomination.

Best Supporting actress: won't happen but possibly Moreno sneaking and Debose or Negga win.",1644277136.0

I respect McKay for giving us a two hour session of watching all of Cheney’s moves being narrated by a judgy voice directing our thoughts on him, and then flips that on its head. The movie makes him look bad and evil throughout, and right as it wraps up, Vice gets his to give his thoughts. They are ruthless but telling. It forces you to take a step back and ask yourself some questions the film had not challenged you with yet. It’s not an attempt to turn Cheney into the films hero, its more of an equally off-putting perspective. It recontexualizes the movie in a slight and meaningful way. Bale is also amazing in his delivery. The movie in general is far from perfect, but thats a damn good scene.",1644259606.0

Even the first film mostly takes place in the desert, where I first thought it would take place in a jungle.

Along that same train of thought, every kids’ show has that one special noir episode. Fairly Odd Parents again, Adventure Time, SpongeBob, etc, they all have had special noir episodes. And a lot of them also had special Rashomon inspired episodes too.

So, that got me wondering. Are there any other adult movies or genres that often get parodied in children’s media? I don’t mean like one kids’ show will have an Easter egg to it.

I just don't quite understand what it was about Burt Reynolds that was able to make these movies so popular. Why was he have so much sex appeal, and was it the sex appeal that made the movies popular? He doesn't even seem that sexy in either of these movies.",1644287656.0
smmdte,Which actor/actress do you think might've had a better career if they had been active in a different era?,3,0.58,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smmdte/which_actoractress_do_you_think_mightve_had_a/,31,"For me it's Scott Adkins.

He's no Pacino as an actor, but he's certainly better than Seagal, Chuck Norris etc. (and better than JCVD was as an actor in his peak stardom). He's a terrific on-screen fighter, has great looks and a certain charisma. The guy would've been way more successful in my view if he were around earlier.

smbnet,(Encanto) Bruno misinterpreted Maribel’s future.,13,0.61,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smbnet/encanto_bruno_misinterpreted_maribels_future/,25,"Yes another encanto theory but hear me out. 

Maribel’s tablet is shown to go from the casita being cracked to fixed when you move the tablet. This doesn’t mean that her future is uncertain as Bruno says. It IS certain. It’s certain that the house will crack and Maribel is the one to fix it. That’s what the tablet is depicting. That’s why it shifts from cracked to normal when you move the tablet with Maribel in front of it. This casita is destined to fall and Maribel will make a new one. 

Which plays into Maribel’s gift. Only her and abuela can talk to the casita. Maribel did not receive her door or her gift because she was chosen to be the new caretaker and leader of casita and the family madrigal. 

Everyone that has a gift has all the expectations of them from abela and she puts an immense amount of pressure on them and their gifts. This is causing their family to break down which breaks down the encanto. Only Maribel can fix it because not having a gift shielded her from these expectations and allowed her to grow as a person and not rely on the gift to be her identity and sense of worth. It’s this unique perspective that she has that allows her to help the family mend. Luisa felt worthless without her gift, Bruno was cast out because of his, Isabella was living a lie under expectations and marrying a man she didn’t love because of hers and Brunos prophesy. The family is slowly tearing apart from the inside and destroying the ecnanto. 

Maribel did have a gift though. But it’s not one that can manifest physically. It’s inside in who she is. And that’s a message to the audience that you don’t need super powers to be special, what you have inside of you can make you special too. Every one of us has a gift. We just don’t know it yet. Like Maribel. 

Maribel’s door did not glow and open because the casita is basically her room as the new head of the house. She doesn’t need a special room. Abuleas didn’t have a special one. And abuelas casita is broken. It had to fall and Maribel had to put her door knob on the new casita for her gift to be realized. The new casita is Maribel’s. She created the new encanto. And she brought The family back together under it, establishing herself as the true heir of the responsibility and family center. 

This is further supported by the flashback where abuela first is gifted the encanto. Her three triplets had received gifts, but not her. She has to take Care of the casita. Maribel not receiving her “gift” is a sign that she is the next in line to care for the casita. And the next child in a generation or two that comes up to their door and it fades, it will be met with rejoice instead of dread, because the casita has chosen their next caretaker.

Why are there no movies showcasing this corruption that is taking place to this very day?

They have a major presence in the global drug trades, especially with fentanyl. They launder billions of dollars, especially through casinos. Chinese criminals own a lot of real estate around the world. They partake in human trafficking, prostitution, tax evasion, weapon trafficking, underground banking, political corruption, and espionage.

The films are all interconnected in some way or another, especially if you believe in The Pixar Theory. Between cinematic universes piling in cash and now multiverses about to become the next big thing, if Avatar is ever going to be taken down from its throne, the only thing that could do is... PIXAR.

PIXAR films are all usually juggernauts at the box office. They've also been around long enough to create huge nostalgia for older properties and are family affairs regardless if it's a sequel or not. Now how do you combine all these fantastical worlds together ala Endgame style? 

The Incredibles is the perfect lynch pin. It's a fantastical world with extraordinary heroes and ofcourse villains. It could easily span land, sea, and space. It could easily involve adults and children characters. It could bring in elements both big as a dinosaur to as small as an ant or the world of toys. Would it be outside of the realm of possibility to see them travel through not only time (past and future), but also alternate realities where Cars inhabit the earth? 

Creating a situation where all of these worlds need to be involved would be easy. The only question is who to choose from each franchise to be involved and how.

This film would be an absolutely huge epic. Every person on Earth would feel the need to see how this all plays out and they'd seek it on the biggest screen possible on opening weekend. I honestly think it would beat Endgame's opening weekend record out of the water. It would probably take up every single screen at a 30 screen multiplex to accommodate demand. It could make double what Avatar made. We're talking every man, woman, grandparent and child wanting to see this film. A child seeing Endgame, Avatar or Force Awakens could be debatable, but nothing would stop the tantrums they have if they're not taken to see the biggest kid's movie ever made.

Do they have to use EVERY Pixar movie? I could personally live without A Good Dinosaur or Brave, but I could easily see Merida joining the action. But otherwise, we're talking new sequels to some of the biggest franchises ever like Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, and Cars. And first-time sequels to movies like A Bug's Life, Up, Coco, Inside Out, Ratatouille, and Wall-E.

The “twist” was incredibly predictable and hardly even felt like a plot twist. It was more just new information we found out as the movie went on, there was no real build up or drama involved with it. 

The acting was pretty bad in my opinion. It was cheesy and awkward. I didn’t care about the characters and I really wasn’t interested to see how it ended up. The best way to describe the movie is bland and tired and I really wanted to like it.

I went in with much lower expectations this time. I’ve been having a “crappy blockbuster” stint lately (Jurassic world films, pirates films) so it’s sort of my genre at the moment. Like everybody else I expected another LOTR and was sorely disappointed at the cinema three times over.

With reduced expectations I could see it for what it is - a crowd pleasing, beautiful, action packed journey that only really teeters off in the last film of the trilogy, punctuated with beautiful landscapes, a suitably epic soundtrack and more monsters than you can shake a wizard’s staff at.

By the time the battle of the five armies starts there is just way too much to tie up, and the result is it feels like a group of 8 year olds were asked “then what happens? Then what happens?” - it’s not confusing, it’s just a bit of hash. So much deus ex machina.

smc15c,Rainbow Studios' 'Blue Planet': The Best CG Animated Movie of the 90s That Never Happened,2,0.58,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smc15c/rainbow_studios_blue_planet_the_best_cg_animated/,1,"I saw a thread from earlier today about a commercial played in theaters that was cut to look like a movie trailer. It got me thinking about trailers I'd seen for real movies that failed to get released. There's been countless titles like this over the years, but the one that immediately came to mind was *Blue Planet* by Rainbow Studios (no, not the BBC doc).

Flash back to the late 90s: 3D animation is the new hotness. Pixar is the reigning champ of CG, still riding high on *Toy Story* and *A Bug's Life.* Sony has announced they're in development of a Final Fantasy movie, but we won't see it in this millennium. Between these two heavy hitters, monetarily speaking, what could possibly compare to what they're giving us?

Enter Rainbow Studios. 

The Internet is still in its infancy, and about 7-8 years before YouTube, so videos were shared on forums through download links (believe it or not, 4Chan was one of the best for this). One day, a bunch of people start hyping up a new movie trailer for a CG film called *Blue Planet*. And it was totally worth tying up your phone line for half a day.

Originally titled *Deadly Tide,* it's about a flooded Earth fighting an invasion of aquatic aliens (think a mashup of *The Abyss* and *Independence Day*). The trailer had everything a young adult could want. Aliens. Explosions. Space battles and dogfights, but underwater. Giant sea monsters. More explosions. All while rocking out to White Zombie's 'More Human Than Human'. All of this was preceded by a cheeky stab at Pixar for being family-friendly, plus a South Park joke for good measure. This was THE CG movie that would kick ass and take names.

[Judge for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHlwzVqFNCA), but do keep in mind this was *really good* CG at the time.

So, what happened? Short answer: Production Hell. Rainbow Studios kept pushing back the release date, then came *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within* with the final nail in the coffin. For as bad as the script was, the visuals were spectacular and instantly made *Blue Planet* look extremely dated. Some time in the early Aughts, Rainbow Studios abandoned the IP and no one picked it up.

There's been way better adult-audience CG movies since then, but for me, *Blue Planet* will always be the champion that never was.",1644192963.0

I believe it is a foreign movie, possibly Chinese or Japanese. It is about a teenager (I think a boy with short black hair and dark clothes. He may have had a sword across his back though not 100% sure) who lives in a village surrounded by a huge (I think red) wall that blocks them from the forest. The kid is warned not to go into the forest because there are monsters there. I remember a scene of him sitting on the slanted roof of a house staring at the woods over the top of the wall. Oddly enough, I don’t think there were any other children in the movie. One day, he sneaks out (I think through the gate in the wall) into the woods. He finds the monster, which I only really remember being a blur of darkness in a dark forest.

I guess it partly depends on how shaky and how often, and the contribution of other techniques. And then the other factor is some people are more sensitive to it.

sn0yif,Thought on Unforgiven,0,0.05,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sn0yif/thought_on_unforgiven/,23,"I don't know what the original screenplay by David Webb Peoples looked like before Clint Eastwood put his hands on it, but the film hasn't aged very well. 

The way most characters in The Hateful Eight refer to Marquis Warren is closer to how it would have been in real life back then, than how Ned Logan is treated in Unforgiven. Granted, he is whipped to death which was a fate more often suffered by blacks than any other group (which is why I suspect Peoples' original script may have been more realistic) but aside from that, not a single N-word, not a single objection from the prostitutes to giving him a ""free one"" and not a single indication that he is considered in any way differently to William Munny. He could have been played by Robert Duvall or Richard Crenna or Sean Connery and not a single line of dialogue would have had to change. This is not realistic. 

Eastwood has a history of giving very biased accounts of past events and characters, e.g. his deliberately miscast J. Edgar biopic where the director seems to hate Martin Luther King almost as much as Hoover did.

I'm not defending a kneejerk woke revision of history (there's nothing woke about Hateful Eight for instance) but Unforgiven was supposed to be particularly naturalistic and it consistently fails to be on a number of counts.

smrobk,Who was more mentally disturbed Edward Norton in Fight Club or Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind?,0,0.33,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smrobk/who_was_more_mentally_disturbed_edward_norton_in/,16,"After watching “A Beautiful Mind”, I couldn’t help but compare this to my other blog “How Unreliability Transcends Not Only Books, Short Stories, or Texts But Also to Movies”. In that blog I analyzed how the movie “Fight Club” is a perfect example of how a movie contains unreliable narration and connected it to “The Yellow Wallpaper”, likewise in this blog I will be doing the same except connecting “Fight Club” to “A Beautiful Mind”. 

“A Beautiful Mind” is a biographical drama which introduces us to the life of gifted mathematician John Nash through his days at Princeton University to his struggle and diagnosis with paranoid schizophrenia and his attempts to overcome the disease at the end of the movie. The movie for inexperienced first time watchers is very good at deceiving those who aren’t familiar with the character that he is in fact unreliable instead of reliable due to his schizophrenia. 

Through the use of objective and subjective perspectives, and the way the director switches between the two of them, we the viewers often miss the shift between the neutral perspective back to John’s perspective. Thus making it difficult to identify between real events and what’s simply a illusion conjured up in the mind of Nash. An example that showcases this is presented when John wakes up in the psychiatric ward after being drugged by Dr. Rosen and his men, where John notices Charles and screams at him for help, but is ignored by a saddened look of disappointment by him. 

The camera then shifts to the subjective view of Dr. Rosen who simply claims, “who are you yelling to”? This is the first real indication that John is unreliable as how does Dr. Rosen not notice that there is another person in the room who John is screaming at for help. Taking this into account, one can infer then, that from the beginning, Charles was simply a hallucination conjured up by his sick mind, which shows that he was already beginning to display signs and characteristics of unreliability due to his schizophrenia. 

This being said an interesting character that backs this claim when examining John is Charles young niece Marcee. As shown throughout the film, John realizes that he must be hallucinating all of it as Marcee never aged during the three years that he met her at the university. This unreliability is also showcased through a scene where Marcee runs through a flock of pigeons on the ground in the park. One would expect the pigeons to scatter and fly away, but as we watch the flock doesn’t fly but rather goes about their own business as if no one was there in the first place.

This connects to “Fight Club” as one would expect, both narrators have some form of mental condition that impedes their ability to accurately portray events to us the viewers. In the case of the unnamed narrator in “Fight Club” we are informed that he is suffering from insomnia, which ultimately causes him to create the ulter ego Tyler Durden, Vs. “A Beautiful Mind” where we soon find out as mentioned before, John Nash is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which causes him to hallucinate the characters Charles, Marcee, and William Parcher. One can infer then from comparing the two of these films side by side is how the 6 types of unreliability can be seen in both movies. In the case of “Fight Club” the narrator’s split personalities impede the narrator from having an accurate understanding of his reality, or rather causes him to have two separate interpretations from two different perspectives. 

He is thus extremely prone to misreport, misread, and misregard everything he experiences. This is in comparison to “A Beautiful Mind” where John’s mind is the sole reason that impedes his accurate understanding of his reality, or rather prevents him from distinguishing what is real and what is not. 

This is what makes the two films such a joy to watch, as both films when you first watch give you the impression that the narrators are reliable, only to have a curveball thrown at you and for them to turn out to be unreliable in the end, or about halfway through.",1644244501.0

I am asking for a suggest because I totally loved the movie and the summer adventures vibes that it transmitted .Thank you all for your precious time , I am looking forward to hearing your suggestions

Edit: as I said I am asking for a movie with summer vibes mostly and if it has romance its gets better. I don't want any horror movies etc. Thanks",1644182719.0

And I think that's the right reaction. I mean, I'm so fucking angry. The movie infuriated me. I'd never reacted like this to a movie before. It's been 20 minutes and I'm still in shock.

Did anyone else react like this? What did you think???

It's an incredible and very important movie. Oh my God.

smomdu,Pandorum (2009): I think it is deeper than we (didn't) thought,0,0.4,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/smomdu/pandorum_2009_i_think_it_is_deeper_than_we_didnt/,12,"(May contain spoilers) Yesterday I watched ""Pandorum"" for the first time and got very intrigued by it's story evolved around some kind of syndrome called pandorum. So, I have made a research and didn't find any mention of what I thought the movies was actually about: in my opinion, only the two protagonists were actually awaken and everything else was just part of the pandorum syndrome. I started to have this idea because the movie keeps telling us about the symptoms and how a similar catastrophe happened to a ship called Eden, in which the events of the movie itself is kind of explained, but from a outside view. I feel like the movie just tells us the vision of people with pandorum and their reasons for doing what they do. What do you think?",1644235340.0
sm7sp2,Jagged Edge,4,0.75,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sm7sp2/jagged_edge/,3,"This is a well done thriller with a solid cast (Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges, Robert Loggia, Peter Coyote) that gives you lots of chances to decide who’s guilty. I watch it every so often because Robert Loggia’s performance is so good he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1985. He plays a crusty investigator to Glenn Close’s lawyer and his foul mouth often provides the snickers needed to a serious murder mystery. Example: Close asks him, “Did your mother ever wash your mouth out with soap and water?” Loggia, “Yeah - it didn’t fuckin’ work.” This is a good thriller, but it’s worth watching just for Loggia’s performance.",1644182136.0

Thoughts on end-of-world movies that Kevin Costner made? 
1. Postman
2. Water World
3. Dances with Wolves

It seems he really took a liking to this story line. Though they are all radically different they play along the same theme.  Was this done because it was popular?  Did he like this style? Did it hurt his star potential at the time?",1644203111.0

I liked the movie but I don't even think I'd put it on my top 50 movies. Am I missing something about the movie. I even read the book and even that was just a average book. 
I'm not saying the movie is bad, I would maybe put it in my top 100 but to be rated #1 of all time that's crazy. There's so many movies I can put in front of it.",1644255181.0

It’s a documentary about teens who leave home and basically become hippies. There was a trailer in 2015, but if you go to the linked website there’s nothing there. It seems like it was abandoned? The latest i could find was a book with the same title, about the same thing, but a completely different person.. so that’s weird but just wondering about the film.",1644226980.0

Power of the Dog: I'm not sure if he was going for a modern regional Montana accent or trying to go more southern cowboy. Either way complete miss

Black Mass: I suppose Boston has a notoriously difficult accent to nail but it was a bad enough attempt that they should've just hired another actor. He didn't have a lot of dialogue but what lines he did have he kinda mumbled through them",1642176455.0
