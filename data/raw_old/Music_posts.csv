s8jx84,Agents of Fortune by Blue Oyster Cult is quietly one of the best albums from the 1970s,165,0.87,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s8jx84/agents_of_fortune_by_blue_oyster_cult_is_quietly/,39,"Blue Oyster Cult's fourth studio album is an adventure from start to finish. The group was often considered by many to be ""the thinking man's heavy metal"" and honestly, this album really backs that claim.

The band seems to master this bizarre oxymoron of being loud yet soft and manic yet confident. The album starts out hot with ""This Ain't The Summer Of Love"" then does a complete 180 as ""True Confessions"" is one of the band's poppier songs. The band fluctuates from different octaves and levels throughout the album, and it's the most organized confusion I've ever listened to...which is exactly how Rock N Roll should be. And how the hell could I forget about ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper?""

The album is one of the band's biggest hits, however, it was buried in the mix as time went on. After all, the album did release in the infamous summer of 1976 which is often regarded as one of the best single years in music history.

Calling it *Emo Fyre Fest* so I dug around to vet it's legitimacy.

First, [I looked up the trademark](https://i.imgur.com/4isVGwE.png) and it looks like it was filed quite awhile ago. In February of 2017 by a Noise Group, LLC. The address listed for the company happens to be [the same building as the Observatoty OC](https://i.imgur.com/aLTVZqs.jpg), a small [venue in southern California.](https://www.observatoryoc.com/) The same venue that was [acquired by LiveNation in 2019.](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/music/story/2019-04-15/live-nation-is-buying-observatory-north-park-and-observatory-santa-ana) So I figure they had the idea maybe? And after the LiveNation acquisition, they finally wanted to bring the idea to life but had to pause due to the pandemic. Just spit balling here.

Getting back to the facts tho, I did a Whois search of the domain and it looks like it was [registered not even 2 months ago](https://i.imgur.com/IVtwN7n.png). It was [registered by a company](https://i.imgur.com/Eh6RvF2.png) called [C3 Presents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_Presents)*;* a company that put on Lollapoolza, Austin City Limits and Voodoo Music + Arts Festival. These are festivals that go on every year and are for the most part well respected and safe events.

While LiveNation, the company behind Astroworld Festival, does have a controlling (51%) stake in C3, it's important to note LiveNation [owns hundreds of Festival Subsidiaries](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525820000028/lyv-20191231xex211.htm), puts on thousands of events a year that go off without a hitch.

If you're worried about a repeated Astroworld catastrophe or a Fyre Fest-style scam event, I'd say it's unlikely to happen. The parities involved seem to have a good track record as far as putting on events. I assume people felt it was sketchy because of the lack of information. The only thing I can chalk that up to is it being a rush job to get the promo out before the new year. I imagine as the year goes on, we'll hear more and the blanks will fill themselves in.

If I happened to get something incorrect or missed something, feel free to comment, I'll update the post accordingly.",1642705053.0

My girl commented saying “that’s some white people shit”. And because I’m half white I was told of course I would like it because it’s in my culture. Don’t get me wrong I know mainly whites will know of queen, but I just admire Freddie  Mercury’s performance for the show. The guys a damn legend from the piano, guitar, dancing, and singing skills obviously. And I loved how he had such great control of the crowd.

I got kinda irritated somewhat because she knows me very well and know me I love music in general. I mainly listen to RnB and some rap. It just bothered me that she jumped to “that’s some white ppl shit” rather than acknowledging my love for music. And saying “I could see why u like that” especially given he started off on the piano which is my favorite instrument. 

Basically for those music lovers out there. That aren’t white, if u were to watch the live aid performance for yourself. Would “that’s some white ppl shit” be the first thing you’d say?",1642608527.0

They're one of those groups that are only ever known for one song yet have tons of more lesser known decent singles. Really any single after the breakthrough success of 1989s Epic is worthy of radio play yet gets barely any. Angeldust from 1992 should have been more of a success than it was but grunge was dominating this era and it kinda got buried under that. I think because of the lackluster sales of angeldust King for a day (1995) suffered a bit. These 90s albums have aged pretty well I think. They were the band that made me appreciate experimental music more  Luckily they have enough of a cult following to be able to headline festivals still.

""I’m very proud to be this year's Global Ambassador for Record Store Day. The places where we go to browse and explore and discover music new and old have always been sacred to me. Record stores are so important because they help to perpetuate and foster music-loving as a passion. They create settings for live events. They employ people who adore music thoroughly and purely. Those people and shops have had a rough few years and we need to support these small businesses more now than ever to make sure they can stay alive, stay eccentric, and stay individual. It’s been a true joy for me to watch vinyl sales grow in the past few years and we, the artists, have the fans to thank for this pleasant surprise. Happy Record Store Day, everyone!

It focuses on analog instruments (electric guitar, electric piano, but really anything that can generate an analog output), which cannot generate a control voltage or midi note output. The method is digital and alters the input waveform to recreate FM, subtractive, analog (-ish), etc. It can also do overdrive emulation, bit crusher and probably a whole lot of other things I haven't thought of yet. The synthesizer itself is at the moment only a very incapable arduino UNO with a sample rate of 4KHz, but I will use something more powerful once I get the chance.

My question is, how do you think this would affect music and musicians? New subgenres? How would you use it?

The rise up from the bottom is always the hardest. In order to be great people, have to do something. In any area of life, the individual has to rise up and become great in their field. It’s never easy and there are always obstacles but we are the only ones who can make us successful. You will have to sacrifice certain things in order to be successful. We must stay motivated and enjoy the journey. Many outside factors always trying to change our path . We have to stay focused - stay motivated and rise up.

s8lxkd,"Friend claims to have never heard of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Nirvana etc. I’m confused.",0,0.5,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s8lxkd/friend_claims_to_have_never_heard_of_bands_such/,38,"To preface this, I’m not talking about listening to them or even knowing any songs, but just generally being aware of their existence.

I was talking with my friend about music the other day after I noticed they frequently wouldn’t know any of the acts I’d mention. Granted, some of the stuff I listen to may be slightly obscure if you’re not in that sort of music, but a good portion of it can be classed as fairly mainstream or even totally mainstream. I’m definitely not someone who is embarrassed to listen to someone if they have more than 10,000 listeners on Spotify - hell my favorite band has like 20 million. If they make good music I don’t care if they have 500 or 5 million. 

I was curious so I sent them a list of some of the most popular/influential bands of all time, things like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Queen, Rolling Stones, etc, (basically r/music HOF) They told me they knew the Beatles and “recognized” Pink Floyd. They had never heard of Led Zeppelin; had no idea what Nirvana was. None of the other bands that I mentioned rang a bell. I mean, I understand not knowing any songs, but I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone older than 13 who has never heard of the name Led Zeppelin. Not from friends, TV, general word of mouth, your parents music tastes… 

Before anyone jumps on me, my friend was not poor growing up or from a non-western country because I do realize that what is popular also depends on your cultural  and socioeconomic upbringing, but for the sake of this debate let’s just assume we’re talking about a standard middle class 20 year old from a western country since that’s where we’re both from. They weren’t sheltered either, so it can’t be a “religious fundamentalist, can’t watch SpongeBob or listen to rock music” type of thing. They just genuinely haven’t heard of almost anything before the 2000s. 

At first I thought they were trolling since we often troll each other and joke around, but they kept insisting they were being 100% honest. They claim that anything older than 20 years old is extremely old and admitted they would be embarrassed to listen to it. They’re not really into music that much as far as they’ve told me, but seem to enjoy more electronic, EDM type stuff. 

The thing is I really can’t fathom the idea of not knowing Queen regardless of what type of music you listen to. You may even hate Queen or not be able to name any of their songs, but I’d say pretty much anyone apart from little kids will have at least a vague idea of the band. I don’t know much about jazz, I don’t listen to it, but I sure as hell know Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and the likes. Have I ever listened to a Miles Davis record? I don’t think so. Jazz isn’t anything I actively seek out, but I recognize the immense impact it had on modern music, how influential it was. I will recognize the biggest names in the jazz scene because they’re so ingrained into pop-culture. You’d basically have to never go online or watch TV or talk to anyone to never hear anyone even vaguely mention these people. 

I don’t know, maybe I am just “obsessed with music” as my friend claimed and this knowledge really isn’t that apparent to the vast majority of people my age, but has anyone had a similar conversation with someone? Is there an explanation?",1642693720.0
s8lskk,🎸Andy Summers mixed big open sounding chords with a backbeat strum on this hit song,0,0.5,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s8lskk/andy_summers_mixed_big_open_sounding_chords_with/,0,"In this mini series you'll learn how to play every single song from the **Police Greatest Hits Compilation album** and in this video you'll learn how to play **""Walking On The Moon""** as recorded by the Police on guitar. 

In this song Andy Summers played some really cool guitar parts and layered them with recording techniques. One part is just a big open chord that rings out for 4 bars. 

The other part is a short strum on what I call the backbeat, beats 2 and 4.

I''ll break them both down for you, and also show you how you can use a looper pedal and play all the parts together!

Sundown by Gordon Lightfoot. Draggin' the Line by Tommy James & The Shondells. Love Is Alive by Gary Wright. Blinded By the Light Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Rock'n Me by the Steve Miller Band. 

I love all these songs and they're markedly different but they have the same vibe that I just can't put into words.

s8bods,Aspiring musicians -- would you pay for music lessons based on principles of psychology? Kind of like Noom?,1,1.0,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s8bods/aspiring_musicians_would_you_pay_for_music/,0,"Wondering if this is a good marketing idea for a lesson studio, so I'm hoping to get reflections from other musicians or aspiring musicians.

I work in the field of psychology research/therapy, but I also went to school for classical guitar and have been playing metal for many years. Because of my psychology background, I learn and teach music using specific behavioral principles related to learning, skill acquisition, goal setting, as well as mindfulness, that I've learned through school and work. It's been really effective for me and seems to work well for people I teach. And I think it's partially because I learn and teach in a way that's idiomatic to how the brain likes to learn, but I've also never charged money for lessons through a personal studio, only a studio where students are found for me -- so I'm not sure if the idea has value/holds water.

My questions are:

* Would you find this angle appealing as an aspiring musician? Do you find it appealing as a musician?
* If so, how much would you pay for such lessons?
* Does it feel gimmicky or too cerebral?
* What aspects might you change?

Any other thoughts or suggestions would be great too. Thanks!",1642657921.0

s7rxfh,Bob Welch was the most important member of Fleetwood Mac,8,0.78,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s7rxfh/bob_welch_was_the_most_important_member_of/,10,"After Peter Green left Fleetwood Mac in 1969, the band went through a revolving door of guitarists/vocalists, but one guy fought through all of it until the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham: Bob Welch.

Welch was recruited to the band after the departure of Peter Green, and he practically kept the band alive as many of the individual members battled their own demons throughout the recording process. Bob Weston was kicked out of the band for having an affair with Mick Fleetwood's wife, and Danny Kirwan would be let go from the band for having violent outbursts during concerts. Bob Welch noted that he also felt completely seperated from the rest of the band due to their complications and problems, but he wanted to stick through as long as he could in order to find creative ways to turn the band around.

After their mildly succesful album *Mystery To Me* was released in 1973, the band decided to take a short hiatus to recooperate from all the drama. However, the band's manager and producers didn't like the fact that they wanted to take a break. In fact, they were so infuriated with this that they formed a completely seperate band and dubbed them the new Fleetwood Mac...without informing the actual members. This caused  the REAL band to take legal action, and although they won the case, Welch was completely worn out and decided to quit the band after the lawsuit...leaving an opening for Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.

Without this bizarre era in Fleetwood Mac's history, their may not have been a band. Bob Welch kept the band going and put them in the perfect place he could for their future success. He was adamant about winning the lawsuit against the band's managers and producers, and rallied the band together to save their careers.

Bob Welch had a great relationship with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, and has even toured with them from time to time. Nicks absolutely adored Welch's sound with the band, and used his music as inspriation to enhance the band's sound.

Thank you Bobby Boy...you should've been inducted into the HOF with the rest of the band...",1642604250.0

Who Really Sang it Better?,31,0.71,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s7itnc/i_will_always_love_you_song_who_really_sang_it/,63,"Dolly Parton originally sang ' I Will Always Love You.' Whitney Houston did a rendition years later to critical acclaim. Many fans say her version was better. But I vehemently disagree. Dolly Parton interpreted the story line of the song better. She wrote the song because she wanted to end her professional partnership with Porter Wagoner with whom she collaborated on the Porter Wagoner Show.  Porter did not want Dolly to go so she poured her heart out to him with this song she wrote about the situation between them. Porter was moved to tears when Dolly played it to him. He allowed her to go and even produced the song.

In conclusion the song is a heartbreak song about a professional relationship. When you listen to Dolly Parton and Whitney Houston's performance of the song, who really echoed the sadness theme of the song? To me, it is Dolly Parton. You can hear and feel the sadness in her voice. We all know Whitney Houston had a terrific voice but her version focused on her vocal delivery rather than on reflecting the spirit or theme of the song. In fact, Whitney Houston's version was just a show off presentation of her vocal dexterity. Dolly Parton's version always rank higher to me when you take into cognisance the history behind the song. Again, Dolly Parton echoed the spirit and theme of the song she wrote in 1973.",1642570915.0

I was wondering if anyone here can help me identify the chords/chord type/position/playing style of the riff. Here’s Kevin Parker playing the song live, the riff starts at 3:45. https://youtu.be/EUtdun8YGAE

There is this artist i can't find any information about: Graslin

As a Canadian living in the US this drives me nuts and causes me anxiety before a show because I don’t know what the crowd around me will do and I want to stand. Will the people around me cause a fight? Canadian shows have crowds jump to their feet when the band hits the stage. Most of the time there’s a lot of singing along at Canadian concerts too.

The only thing I've ever heard that was even close was the chorus from Hard-Fi's Living For The Weekend. 

The bit where he says ""Out there tonight  
Is the night of my last got my name on  
Run down my street adidas on my feet  
I'm on fire""

I know this is a long shot but it's nearly been 20 years lol, this is my only shot at this point.

The dawn of 2000s needed someone to take action and save rock or else the whole genre might have faded away. In 2001 ''The Strokes'' released their first album called ''Is this it?'', they ended up in the largest bidding war for a rock band in years, they competely changed the landscape of modern rock with their sound. The Strokes speak to an entirely new generation of kids with the same push for individuality and rebellion that lies in the heart of what rock has always represented. Not only did they create a record that changed what the 2000’s conception of rock would be, they themselves became the pioneers that new bands would look towards for inspiration. In the years following is this it, countless new bands sprung up that borrowed from the new sound of The Strokes and created their own unique spin on it. You can hear them all over the later 00s bands that dominated the radio like The Killers, Arctic Monkeys, and Franz Ferdinand. The unrelenting pace and vocals of “Mr. Brightside” could have practically been off of Is this it? I think it’s fair to say that most indie rock artists who came up after hearing Is this it,can largely relate to this line off the latest Arctic Monkeys’ record - “I just wanted to be one of The Strokes”",1642635701.0

I am not from the East or the West
Not out of the ocean or up from the ground
Not natural or ethereal, not composed
Of elements at all

In this world or in the next
Did not descend from Adam and Eve
Or any origin story
My place is placeless
A trace of the traceless
Neither body or soul
I belong to the beloved
Have seen the two worlds as one
And that one call to and know
First, last, outer, inner
Only that breath breathing human being",1642558682.0

I think I have connected some of the dots as to why they garner so much negativity, but it still baffles me a little.

First off, they aren't from the Seattle scene. Hell, they aren't even from the American Grunge scene. They're Brits that kind of rode the hype waves of Grunge during the mid-90s and that seemed to rub people the wrong way. At the time, Brit Pop and Shoegaze were EXTREMELY popular in the UK, so Bush never succeeded super well in their own country besides their debut album. The UK was saturated with the likes of Oasis, Blur, Radiohead, Pulp, and The Verve at the time, so it makes sense as to why they targeted an American audience.

Second, some people don't even consider Bush to be grunge. I know that many people consider grunge to be Seattle based ONLY, however, they're sound is VERY much grunge whether you like it or not. Razorblade Suitcase is even considered ""the last grunge album"" by some publications. However, other publications call their sound too reminiscent of Nirvana while dubbing the group one of the original poster-childs for the post-grunge scene.

Although many people at least respect Sixteen Stone (debut album), others can't seem to find anything worthwhile in their later works. I've seen countless people say that their sound is a complete rip-off of Nirvana and Soundgarden...and those same people don't even categorize Bush as grunge music necessarily.

Why does Bush seem to be the one collectively hated band from the grunge scene? I think they're pretty good...Razorblade Suitcase is a terrific farewell to the world of grunge and Sixteen Stone may be one of the most important albums from the earlier half of the decade. Am I missing something here? Please elaborate someone...",1642527360.0

He wrote it about the experience of navigating queer relationships. I hope you enjoy it! In the fall, he decided not to go back to school and pursue his career music full time. I am so proud of him for the work he put into this & for following his dreams. Go show him some love!!!!

One example would be DeVita, who's a kr&b artist that [sounds nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKl7-v-iCaA) like more contemporary examples.

Would it be fair to call her simply R&B, or is it under the KR&B classification?

**-How to I find the combinations that sound good within the scale patterns**

**-How do I make my solos not sound like scales**

**-Being more melodic and less “pentatonic scale” sounding.** 

Scales are important to know as a primer for understanding some theory, and how things work, but once you get the basic boxes down, of which there are typically 5, then you need what I call vocabulary in those boxes. This is where you start making music with those notes, instead of just running the patterns up and down.

Getting some vocabulary together would help solve all three of those above questions.

Here's the thing though the first time I tried to do this it didn't sound that great. I found out that I just wasn't going to play an amazing lick or solo on my own. First I needed to steal some ideas from the greats.

If you do this you will get there faster. What you want to do is learn some licks and melodies from famous recordings.

So that is what I am going to show you in this video we'll dive into 3 EPIC blues licks that are all right out of the pentatonic/blues scale in the key of E.

These licks are note-for-note from the beginning of Howlin' Wolf's ""Back Door Man.""

If you haven't heard this recording check it out on YouTube it has over 11 million views! Wolf starts off the song doing a little rant about the blues, and then he says, **""I'ma show you how to play the blues, now you just sit here and watch me""** then he plays these 3 licks that give me the chills every time!

It’s Hella embarrassing to admit but I’ve come to a point where I just don’t know what to do with my voice anymore and I feel like some lessons along with a second pair of ears to provide me with some constructive feedback is really the only way that I’m going to sort out this problem. 

My top three influences our Mac Miller Juice WRLD and Trippie Redd with a special mention for Eminem and Kanye West so that’s the vein I’m going for. 

Is anyone here a teacher or give lessons or maybe have some tips tricks or wisdom to impart? 🙏

s6iobr,Why do bands take so much grief for evolving their sound?,28,0.75,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/s6iobr/why_do_bands_take_so_much_grief_for_evolving/,47,"I recently was introduced to the band Slothrust, who've put out several albums before the latest one, which is the one I heard. It's excellent. Smart songwriting, excellent musicianship, and a singer with a powerful voice. Doing my research I found the usual horde of fans who decry the ""commercialization of the sound"".   


But all bands change. I think they change, largely, because they get better at their craft. Red Hot Chili Peppers are a prime example of this. Their early records were punk and funk influenced, tons of energy but not much musicianship. The Frusciante records are more complicated, with much better musicianship and production. But there's a contingent of fans who think ""BSSM"" is their pinnacle, and even some who claim ""BSSM' was when they ""sold out"".   


Some bands manage to get away with it. Nobody decries The Beatles for going from ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" to what became their ultimate sound. Same for Radiohead----nobody's really calling for a return to ""Pablo Honey"" or ""The Bends"".   


And there are some bands who manage to keep their original sound and succeed with it. AC/DC and Motorhead come to mind.   


But most bands evolve their sound, and that's what I expect. I don't know why people would be resistant to an artist getting better.",1642463175.0

It would be great if you could recommend me some music similar to the ones I’m currently enjoying! As of now, Arctic Monkeys and Kings of Leon I really like 

I’ll link my Spotify playlist below so that you could see the current rock style I’m into. Look at the recent songs first since there isn’t much rock music at the start of my playlist. My music taste gradually gets heavier as the playlist evolves; I think it exhibits the transformation in my music taste over the last few years - it’s kinda cool :D  and hey, cut me some slack I’m still learning about the rock world!

As many of you know Melbourne has been one of the most locked down cities in the world and it’s taken a huge hit on our local music/arts industry. 

In between lockdowns a group of mates(me included) decided to form a band called Open Kamodo.

Despite the challenges we managed to build a home studio and release our first self produced EP “Volume 1”

I’d love it if you could check us out in the link below and support us on all socials;
https://linktr.ee/openkamodo

We can’t do gigs down here at the moment as they keep getting cancelled due to covid. We’re not too sure how else we can get our name out there so I thought I’d try hitting up reddit. 

I’m not too sure how this platform works lol But thanks for taking the time to have a read. I hope you have a listen and enjoy our music.

Cheers, Tom.",1642505070.0

Although I appreciate getting a slow trickle of new content from artists I like, it feels a little spammy and makes the album release feel a little underwhelming.
