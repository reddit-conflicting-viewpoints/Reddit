My company gave us 25 and 4 sick days per year. The law is a bit grey in this area but usually the company can't reject your PTO request unless they have a very strong reason. However, common sens dictates that you let the company know about your days off as soon as you schedule them. For 1-2 days, unless there is an emergency, a week is enough. For 2-3 weeks at least a month. 

Anyway, at the end of January I informed my boss that I will need two days of mid February. I was denied because we are onboarding a new client and the company really needs us there so unless there is an emergency, no days off are allowed until the end of March. This is absurd and I didn't think that the onboarding process will suffer if I'll be away for two days but I didn't want to cause any troubles so I rescheduled my days at the end of March. I spoke with my colleagues and they had the same issue: their days off were declined.

Yesterday morning during a meeting with the client my boss didn't join. I reschedule the meeting and pinged my boss on teams and saw that he's got on out of office message saying that he'll be away for two weeks. I tried to ping another senior colleague of mine but he's also away. Turns out they went skiing together.

I went and had a discussion with HR and then with my boss's boss. They were not informed that we are not allowed to take days off for 3 months and they looked as pissed off as us about his decision to go skiing.

snknru,The fallacy of professional fulfillment and the anti-work movement,32,0.98,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snknru/the_fallacy_of_professional_fulfillment_and_the/,5,"(Long text alert)

Before the pandemic, we lived in the age of seeking ""professional fulfillment"", with the media selling the idea of ""​​pursuing a career doing what you love"", because then ""you won't work a day in your life"". So, we went to great lengths to achieve such a realization, even if it meant sacrificing our health and personal life. In fact, this sacrifice was well accepted by the corporate world, for obvious reasons. It was ""cool"" to be a workaholic. If the workaholic was getting sicker and sicker, physically and emotionally, it didn't matter.

In fact, the aversion to work has always existed. Therefore, employers and the system needed to instill ideas of professional fulfillment in people, as well as the fear of being poor and homeless, so that they would remain tame, working more and more, and generating billions in profits for the system, in the promise of a better life and such ""professional fulfillment"".

The pandemic has partially broken this paradigm. While, on one hand, some workers were forced to go to the workplace, to have contact with other people, and thus increase the risks of contracting Covid, others went through the experience of paid isolation, that is, they spent days off at home, because at the time there was hope that the pandemic would last a month at most.

The isolation made people start to reflect on the lifestyle they had been living so far, and how much absurdity there is in it. Many understood that their role was just to be a cog in a machine that generates power and wealth only for its owners. Thus, they began to occupy their time with really meaningful activities, and far from the slave-holding standard of the corporate world.

Many workers, meanwhile, have already moved directly from office work to remote work, with all its pros and cons.

So, while for some there was a chance to have greater flexibility in schedules and better use of time for their personal tasks,

for others it caused enormous stress, as it became more difficult to manage home and work at the same time.

Employers, for their part, had cleverly taken advantage of the fact that most workers were loving remote work to increase their workload and demand more productivity. Since workers were ""happy"" with their new condition and dreaded the idea of ​​having to go back to the office, they would ""gladly accept"" the massive increase in the number of tasks.

The routine of endless working hours, calls and emails outside of office hours and on weekends has become very common. People were no longer able to separate work from rest.

This whole situation quickly multiplied the cases of burnout, anxiety and depression in the corporate world. People were getting sick even at home, even living the dream of remote work, and this also made them question the current employment model.

Workers who were forced to risk their lives in the workplace were revolted. Many actually contracted Covid, many have died and/or infected relatives (who often died as well).

People began to realize what work really is: a modern form of slavery, which will enrich only the employer and the system. Those who do not work are excluded economically and socially. The promises of ""make your way to the top"" or ""work with what you love"" are nothing more than traps to keep the employee tame and obedient"".

It became clear that the current model of employment and production had reached its limit. Do we really need to work that hard? Does the industry really need to produce that much? Do we really need to consume that much? How much will that cost to people's health and world environment?",1644328080.0

I'll be working at a job where they hired me right at the end of my interview, for significantly higher pay and a higher role. Everyone in my life is congratulating me.

I've been crying since I got home.

The curriculum I developed at my soon-to-be-ex job was something I poured my heart and soul into. I *love* nature, I loved getting to manage a garden, I love teaching kids about the world around them! I loved getting to play a big role in the community. I loved the kids.

My one manager said it was ""inevitable that someone as talented as [me]"" would want to leave the organization in search of bigger things. But it really wasn't. I could've done this job forever. It's been the stress and disorganization and, frankly, the bullying (thanks other manager!) that broke me down.

The kids'll miss me. The organization (even the bits of it that bullied me) is gonna miss me. The plants will miss me; I get sad knowing a bunch of them will probably die without my care. Getting a ""better job"" doesn't feel like a victory, and I can't explain that to the people congratulating me.

It's partly guilt, but not just that. I want to live in a world where I didn't *have* to get a better job to keep living :c

As some backstory, we’ve been forming a union for a couple years now and recently had what’s called a “unit hearing.” Basically, this means that lawyers and the government call you in to testify about what your job is. You get subpoenaed to testify so you’re legally unable to refuse to go.

Anyways, one of my coworkers gets subpoenaed to the hearing. So she goes – all good, right? Wrong. Ends up, she’s on the spectrum and had arranged with her training manager to get flexible deadlines for her work. This is a reasonable accommodation for her disability and doesn’t hurt the company at all, but she had only been granted this accommodation by her direct supervisor and hadn’t gone to HR about it (precisely because she was afraid of discrimination if she told people outside of her team).

So one of the company’s owners sees her at the hearing (something she couldn’t refuse to go to) and starts examining her deadlines. He sees that her deadlines are different than other peoples and confronts her one on one. He grills her about her deadlines and then personally revokes her disability accommodations. Obviously, this is illegal (violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act), but he doesn’t care. And now she can’t do her job and has to take an extended medical leave while she hires a lawyer and tries to sort everything out. If she didn’t have family support, she could quite literally be homeless right now because her disability limits the kinds of jobs that she’s able to take.

Another one of my co-workers was subpoenaed to testify but doesn’t have quite the same job, so there aren’t deadlines for the bosses to examine. Even before she testified, both of the company’s owners identified her as a union supporter and were clogging up her DMs, taking away her assistant (which people in her position typically have), and increasing her workload. After she testifies, the owners keep interrogating her about her job. Eventually, all this puts her on medical leave because, between not having an assistant and being constantly harassed by the bosses, the stress from work gives her a mental breakdown. So during her leave, she gets a lawyer and works out disability accommodations with HR. After these accommodations were worked out, the HR manager who set them up was dismissed or quit, and she was told that she could not have those accommodations anymore. My co-worker was then put on an “indefinite suspension” the day she was supposed to return to office, and the company ultimately terminated her for downloading files that she couldn’t have done her job without.

These aren’t the only stories I could share but I’ll leave it here for now. I can post more in the comments or do a follow-up post or something if people want.

TL;DR: My bosses used my co-workers’ disabilities as weapons to punish them for testifying in response to subpoenas.

The presentation was lead by my boss’s business coach. It didn’t sit right with me. The points that were driven home were bothersome. Such as: Small goals don’t matter and they mean nothing. And I’m sitting there silently seething with rage because I’m thinking to myself, ‘well what about those of us who struggle with our mental health? With chronic pain?’ Sometimes small goals *are* the only goals. And how you should always push yourself even harder even when you think you can’t go any farther. I get that, but I feel like it’s almost encouraging work related burnout which I don’t agree with. 

And the other thing was how you should always be honest with people even if it is harsh because respect is more important than being liked. Again, I don’t agree with this. In some cases, yes. But you have to learn how to be kind. The example the business coach used was someone who goes to his gym got a new hairstyle and she asked him how it looked and he said he was honest and told her she looked hideous. I’m like ???? It is a matter of opinion, not a fact. And I don’t feel like this behavior is going to make anyone respect you if you just act like a straight up a**hole. And lastly, how you should always want to go higher. Some of us don’t want to keep climbing the corporate ladder and we should be allowed to be content where we are. Sorry for the vent. I just found myself tuning out the entire time yesterday because it was really getting under my skin. I actually had to turn my camera off to hide my rage, lmao.

Why can’t we ever have work related meetings like ‘good enough is good enough’. And talking about ways to PREVENT burnout instead of how you should just exhaust yourself and work even harder when you feel like you can’t which will inevitably lead to burnout? And ways you can and should implement self care and boundaries if you really can’t take on any additional projects?

Since I started it has been an abolished shit show, my training was cancelled indefinitely due to business needs during “busy season” and me and the rest of my training class were tossed onto the phones with virtually no support and made to figure out our jobs on our own as we went along. Recently I proposed to my girlfriend and yesterday I informed my boss I would be getting married in January of 2023 and would need about a week off for the wedding and honeymoon. I was promptly and firmly told that the date fell on “black out dates” for the assumed busy season and a wedding was not something they would make an exception for and my supervisor had the balls to say to me he would hate to make me choose between my bride and my job.

Things seemed great for the first few months but then their true colors came out. I brought up concerns about how I was being treated, and that I didn’t feel the work I produced was valued, or appreciated. I ran social media for 6+ accounts, did graphic work, video editing, copywriting, social media strategies, client proposals, analyzed data, research, the list goes on. When I brought up these concerns, their response was “we will agree to disagree.” Didn’t seem appropriate or professional in any way shape or form. Yesterday, I was working on a content calendar, and making some edits for the client. My boss called me because she saw that I was in the document….doing my job, and she decided it would be appropriate to yell at me and give me attitude….all for doing my job and what I was hired to do in the first place. I will preface that she micromanaged everything that I did, and gave me no creative control, since she would go in and edit my copy or remove things without telling me. This was unacceptable. My time and work was important. Not to mention, several people quit before me. I was also the only one doing social media for these clients. After the way she treated me over the phone, I told her I quit and will be emailing a formal resignation letter.

One a government job and the other for a coffee company. I am available to work between the 2 jobs from 5am-10pm Sunday to Saturday. But I set Both up to work around the other one. Today is the 5th time the government job has screwed me into being late for the coffee job and if I complain the paper they made me sign states they have the right to fire me for my coffee job interfering with the government job. I'm sorry but 20 hours a week between both jobs still isn't enough to live on but getting the coffee job is the best I could get so far in the last 3 months of looking for a better full time job to get out of this bullshit sucky government job. And the coffee shop keeps closing every 20 mins for covid exposures but were forced to lie and tell customers it's staffing shortages. So within the last month that I have been working for the coffee place it's been shut down 3 times for 5 days each. (Did I mention I've only worked at the coffee job a month? No income coming in during shut downs)

I have applied now to over 800 jobs threw indeed with all stuff that I know I am capable of doing and have experience in. And over 50 jobs on the company websites themselves. Most of which was for less pay than the government job ($15 an hour is what I make at the gov job). 

I have received the interview for the coffee place and took it ($12 an hour), an interview for a 6 month contract for a temp agency with no benefits for $14 an hour which I turned down because I need a permanent position to qualify for a loan soon but my pay has been too low for me to get one and scammers calling me to try to get my information. 

I don't buy this load of bullcrap that we have a worker shortage and desperately need people, if you really needed people you would have gave people interviews and the chance to work for your company. I have been applying for anything $12 an hour and over... that's not enough to live on and I still can't get but 2 calls for interviews? That's a joke.",1644337592.0

I work in a very small manufacturing job in a fairly rural area. It’s pretty wack all around, but it required vaccinations which is pretty wild for where I’m at. I get paid 14 an hour and technically am full time. 

I haven’t had a full week of work since Christmas. There have been supply issues, met with ineptitude that have left us with nothing to consistently produce for months. On top of that they turn the heat off in the warehouse after every shift, making it insanely unpleasant every morning. I’m talking 38 degrees inside when we show up. 

The boss sits in his office with his space heater every day leaving me with my co-worker, who begins sneaking drinks at around 9 am and is fairly drunk by lunch. The chaos of that place is too much for me. 

Last week my coworker had a Covid exposure via his sister who he lives with. While testing negative, my employer doesn’t seem to grasp the concept of the incubation period and I’m not trying to willingly expose me self. I live with my partner and my father, both of which have compromised immune systems. 

I decided that a text was all that was needed here. There’s barely enough work as it is, and before I came along it was just a one man show. My boss immediately calls me, and texts me saying that a heads up would have been appreciated. He’s not mad but wants to work something out. I’m supposed to call him to day, though I don’t know what to say.

The offer is unfortunately for less then I am making now but still, it feels good. 

I also know my current employer will have an incredible difficult time replacing me.  I am an Web Developer, who built their web application that calculates the values for used aircraft. To say it is an niche area, is an understatement.  It requires advance understanding of database structure, math and web applications. 

My particular frustration comes from having rebuilt the interface to manage the database for the aircraft historical data, and asking my boss to test it for the last six months before it went live. It went live a few weeks ago and my boss, the primary user never tested it, or even looked it. But now there are errors, and he inform me he is too busy to test the interface. But expects me to work days where the office is close, to fix the issues, while he is off work. There was even a day when I was coming out of surgery three years ago, and I was called on my way home from the hospital. I had to do work, home fresh from surgery, before I could take my pain meds.

I am the only backend developer they have. I have worked for the company for over five years (no raise ever), with only help from one part time front end developer. They have occasionally try to hire another developer, but no one has been able to handle the math and database needed for the pay they are offering.

&#x200B;

If you’re tired of hearing about a pandemic resurgence, sick of video conferencing, excited to

see and catch up with co-workers, want to dress professionally or go out to lunch downtown,

then I am not the only one eager to get back to the office.

&#x200B;

As we get through winter and get closer to spring, it’s encouraging to see a much higher

understanding of COVID-19 variants and better risk management through vaccinations and

boosters. It appears we are moving back to some kind of pre-pandemic normalcy: vaccines, new

COVID-19-fighting medications and shorter mandatory isolation times, ... all elements that allow

us to return to work faster. The most recent variant has been compared to the flu, with some

experts stating it will be considered eventually an endemic, something we will need to accept as

part of life.

&#x200B;

While these times of uncertainty have been challenging, we are seeing more Canadians voicing

their need to get back to normal. Over the next few weeks, all offices of \*\*\*\*\* will be

reopening with full attendance, following our “Work Smart Program” guidelines. This program is

not a policy or a one-size-fits-all approach, but truly an evolution of our culture, for everyone.

Our physical well-being and mental health remain a top concern as things start to stabilize and

allow us to get back to our offices. Therefore, you will soon receive your opening dates from your

RVP’s and leadership of your region, according to guidance from your local health authorities.

&#x200B;

We are excited to be able to work together again. During the months that we were fully open,

we noticed a lot of jubilation from our employees, in being able to work collaboratively and

increase teamwork by physically being together. We expect this will be even more relevant as

we open all offices and get back to working with our peers, co-workers, and friends. We have

demonstrated resilience and hope through the last two years, and now, we are more optimistic

than ever that better days are ahead.",1644340819.0

snop9x,Leaving my job today,5,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snop9x/leaving_my_job_today/,3,"Hey y'all. After just 4 months of my this role, I'm leaving my new job. I'm a corporate e-comm supply chain analyst. I stumbled into this career path after college - I went to school for geography, and ended up sticking with supply chain because of the industry demand and growth potential.

However, in this role (and in others in the past), I've been placed on a small, beyond lean team. We are constantly over-worked, over-scheduled and stressed to the max. Within my first few weeks in this role, my colleague (who was training me) left the company. Since then, I have been doing the job I was hired for, in addition to her job which has still not been backfilled. 

My manager is on vacation this week and now even though I am an analyst who has been with the company for 4 months, I am essentially being treated as her fill-in. So essentially I'm doing 3 jobs at once. The VP is chatting me on Teams every morning for reports/data and slide deck inputs to other VPs and the President of the company, in addition to my normal work duties and preparing for 10+ meetings tomorrow, 5 of which I lead. I've been getting brought into meetings at the last second and am being skewered by other managers/directors in front of their teams, all while I'm trying my best to keep afloat and respond to everything as quickly as I can, while it's essentially impossible and unrealistic to expect that. My colleagues and I are all just cogs in a wheel. I know nothing about most of them personally, and I expect I never really would. We're just asses in a seat, faces on a screen, names to pester for updates on initiatives/transactions on a constant basis. It's dehumanizing and exhausting. The wheel never stops spinning and it never really goes anywhere, either.

The pay at this company is decent, and it's a brand/name that all of you have heard of. However, my mental health has been in a sharp decline. When I'm at work, I'm constantly stressed and either take zero lunch or a 10-minute break and that's it. When I'm done with work, I'm decompressing for the day and focusing on what needs to be done the next day. You can guess how this pattern translates to both Saturdays and Sundays as well. 

I used to be a creative, adventurous, easygoing person. I was signed to two record labels before I was 18. I studied abroad in college in an obscure place and sought out unusual adventures. I like making people laugh and feel comfortable, but these days all I care about is work, my outputs at work, and making sure I have enough mental capacity/stamina for work the next day/week/etc. I've been getting sick more, and the sickness lasts longer because I compile it with being stressed on how it'll affect my performance at work and knowing that I can never have a slip-up or make a mistake.

snq37p,US Wealth Re-Distribution and how it would look like,3,0.71,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snq37p/us_wealth_redistribution_and_how_it_would_look/,11,"Let's look at some of the numbers regarding wealth re-distribution in the US and how things would look if we would confiscate the wealth of the super rich and give it to the normal person.

The main numbers is that there are about 329.5 million Americans. Of those there are a little more than 20 million people that are millionaires ([20.27 million people](https://spendmenot.com/blog/what-percentage-of-americans-are-millionaires/)). Then we have [724 billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/).

Let's start with just looking at the top 25 wealthiest Americans according to this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_Americans_by_net_worth#Top_25_richest_Americans). They are worth a total of $2,049.7 billion. If we were to take all of that money except for $1 billion for each of them we could give every non-millionaire American $6,548 right now.

In the [2021 Forbes 400](https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/) list of the 400 wealthiest Americans it says they have a total of $4.5 trillion between them. None of these people have less than $2.9 billion in net worth. If we do the same thing and take all of their money over $1 billion for each of them we could give every non-millionaire American $13,259 right now.

If we are a little less nice and give those 400 wealthiest people only $1 million after re-distribution each non-millionaire American would get $14,551 right now.

Here we are only talking about the super wealthy. There are still 324 billionaires this wouldn't be affecting and the $14,551 number we currently have could go even higher if we start including them. Let's not even talk about all of the people that are currently millionaires but are not yet billionaires! It would be interesting to see how much we could give everybody if we would cap everything at $1 million. It would be life changing money for so many people!

I realize that a lot of the wealth is in the form of stocks and other such things but if those stocks are transferred to people they can be bought and sold and these people that now own the stocks can liquidate their assets. This is mostly a thought exercise and shows how much money these people are hoarding and how much money each normal person could be receiving if this type of re-distribution would  take place.",1644342325.0

But I'm really confused about the amount of post I come across on this sub about people either getting fired or forbidden to talk about salary, or even mention in the contract about this interdiction (but this last one might be fakes, not really sure). 

So, I'm wondering, is there actually a law, in either a state, if so which ones, or a Federal one that can ban salary discussion among employees ?

Can companies really implement a ban on this subject without repercussions ?

Anyways all employers have to pay there workers these ‘construction minimum wages’ on these government projects. Don’t get screwed over. If any of you work on the Interstate, build post offices, or other government buildings then click the link below and make sure you are getting paid correct wages!  

\*wages might be higher/lower for different crafts and where at in the country you work\*

I work for a local government agency in the US. We have a union.

 Last week we just found out a new statute/policy was going into full enforcement. It basically states that no employee can vent, talk down about or complain about their working conditions, supervisors, or the city in any way, regardless if whether they are on the clock or not. 

Say if I was at home, on my day off, and I go onto  Facebook and complain (never done that but I know some folks that do) about my employer not approving sick leave or vacation time and my boss, or someone that also works for my employer see that, all they have to do is file a complaint to HR and boom, investigation time. 

The union has fought this thing tooth and nail. What was going to be a fireable offense is now a suspension and write up. 

This goes for venting or complaining to other coworkers or really, anyone in general. A coworker can simply file a complaint against you simply because they were having a bad day. BAMM! You will immediately be under investigation. 

It's not enough that it's so hard to find workers and keep them, now my employer is actively seeking to punish those that remain, for simply venting about something at work. 

This just shows you how employment laws in the US only protects employers and are actively against the employees.

Edit. I'll be deleting this post soon as it could get me into trouble. Believe it or not, this post would be a prime example of inciting an investigation.

Edit: wow. This post has gotten a ton of traction and decided to leave it up. I also wanted to post a sorta update.

It's a great long read but in case it's too long (it is long!) I summarized it for all of us!

**TL;DR:**

* **Since 2017, private-equity backed firms like Greystar have done rapid takeovers of apt. buildings all over the US. Private equity takeovers of housing has led to soaring rents (sometimes +25% in a year), no hot water sometimes, the PE firms not paying for trash pickup (leaving scattered trash everywhere) and reducing security guard patrols.**
* **Of 35 biggest multifamily apt building owners, now almost HALF of the owners are private equity.**
* **These PE firms flip these buildings, then unload them for profit. These PE-led apt. housing funds try to return 20% compared 4% for regular real investment trusts. Greystar CEO Bob Faith has bragged about these returns.**
* **Freddie Mac has enabled these firms, accounting for 85% of biggest apt. bldg. purchases. After Freddie issues the loan, it allows PE firms to jack rent with no tenant protection. Blackstone was also accused of tenant abuse in 2017.**
* **Biggest PE firms involved have been Greystar, Southern Management, Lone Star, Irvine Co. and Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, & Starwood Capital. Both Goldman & Starwood were implicated in fraud in ANOTHER ProPublica study called ""The Bigger Short"" on commercial real estate fraud.**
* **Firms like Blackstone fight regulation; they spent nearly $83 million in California to fight rent control measures, 3x their opponents'.**
* **This is happening under a housing crunch over the past few years, as many of these firms took advantage of the boost in renters from the 2008 crash, and even more so now during the pandemic.**

He says for positions that are hybrid (2-3 days in-office per week) the fill rate drops to about 60%.

For positions that are 100% in-office, the fill rate is less than 10%.  No one is willing to go into an office 100% of the time if there is no reason for it.

I am a developer on a very small team for a small company and we are all 1099. This is my first dev job and I've been there about a year.
I was given this internal customer support app to work on alone. Fine. But given just one 3 week sprint to do it during which I was on vacation for the 1st week after handoff of the design. Then I got covid. 
Basically I didn't get it completed in time even though it was a non-essential app and i completed what I could complete without the rest of the api's (which my boss still hasnt given me) the next week. 
Today my boss has a talk with me about the hours I've billed for Jan. Essentially accusing me of not having worked the hours I billed. Because the code that I did do on a separate branch wasn't merged into development before the end of that sprint. 
It had a file structure,  api call, types, slices/reducers, components, a few feature pages. He refused to even look at the branch and just kept referencing how he hadn't seen anything in development.  
Nevermind that I got the entire app finished the following week. 
This is a rant but I could just cry. They keep piling more and more shit onto us. We rebuilt the entire front end for web and mobile in like 5 months and they just keep adding external apps and more features at the speed of light. 
We don't even have our FE TESTED because we have no time and it's never prioritized in sprints.
Then in this discussion he was like 'I really like you as a person and you have a great opportunity here. But this can't happen again' and I was like 'what go on vacation and then get covid????' 
He just kept saying how it's such a good opportunity to work with so many skilled people. Meanwhile neither of our 2 seniors has any time for mentorship and one can barely speak English. The guy who doesn't know much English is very smart and talented but it can be hard to get feedback or ask him for help because it's awkward having to ask him to repeat himself 5 times. 
Anyway during this convo he also told me that there aren't many jobs out there for people who aren't senior devs (a lie) and basically insinuated that I should stay and learn and just, I don't know not get sick I guess. 

I'm just so done. He wouldn't even look at the code that I had written in January. He just had this narrative that because the entire app wasn't done in time I hadn't done enough work.

snn1iv,Advice on quitting?,2,1.0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/snn1iv/advice_on_quitting/,0,"So I've been lurking for a while on this sub, trying to learn some stuff, and I've decided to ask some advice on quitting my job. For context, I work a full-time job during the week, a part-time job on the weekends, and some dog-sitting on the side (usually once a week). The job in question is my weekend job, which I'm considering leaving.

Since September 2021 I've been working at a kid's toys & games store on Saturdays & Sundays. It's a small place, pretty quiet except on holidays, not the worst retail job ever but it's still retail lol. The owner & my managers are relatively reasonable, my coworkers are fine, but the customers are annoying (naturally) and the pay is... starting to feel like it's not worth it, let's say that. To be clear I took this job as an extra support for my income, which is just barely enough to cover rent, groceries, and bills. But, I'm getting off-topic.

Anyway, recently more frustrations have been piling up. For one, back in the beginning of January the owner told me that after the holiday rush, things get pretty slow so she'd be cutting my hours because I won't be much needed on the floor. She said that in-store traffic would start increasing again toward the end of January, so I thought okay, I'll get back to my normal hours by the last week in January. Nope. Previously, I would work 5-6 hours on Saturdays and 4 hours on Sundays, staggered with other employees. But ever since the start of 2022, I've only been working 4 hours on Saturdays and nothing on Sundays. Hell, even this week, she said to only come in from noon-3pm this Saturday (Feb 12). I suspect that it's because of the new person who just started, who also works weeks & weekends, but still. Honestly at this rate I'm making more from my once-weekly dogsitting than at the store. So that's fun.

The other issue is my manager. At first she seemed chill, very understanding, but also v picky on how us employees are supposed interact with customers. I know it varies with retail but we have a VERY rigid set of rules. If you don't say this, this, and this, you more or less get talked to by the owner or get a ""friendly"" reminder of The Rules. (Sometimes I feel like an NPC in a BioWare game I stg.) Anyway, we had really bad weather two weeks ago, a huge snowstorm, and my manager told me not to come in - not like I would have been able to because of all the ice we got lmao. But then on Sunday, the DAY after the snowstorm, when I was not scheduled to come in, she texted me begging me to come in ""as a favor"" because another employee who *was* scheduled for that day had ""bailed"". (I was like well of course she did because it's fking impossible to travel but okay.) I told her, no, I don't feel safe walking bc of the terrible conditions, she responded ""aw, too bad"" & left it at that.

Then this last weekend, while working my (reduced) hours, I asked a customer to please put their drink at the back counter. It's our policy bc we've had so many spills lmao. He mumbled something to me about his wife and kept walking. I stopped him again and tried to gently explain it but he said, more clearly, ""no, my wife is here, we're literally leaving"", cuz I'd not heard him the first time; I'm partly deaf, and because of COVID masks make it impossible to lip-read, which is what I've relied on my whole life. So misunderstandings with customers happen often. My manager called the customer over and loudly apologized for my behavior & tried to explain it away with the 'spills' line. She knows about my hearing, I've even interpreted in ASL for deaf customers before so I thought she had more awareness about this. Pretty embarrassing since the other customers were watching (it's a small store haha), but like I say, it happens often, so I try not to let it get to me.

That's really it. I'm sure a lot of this has been mentioned on this sub before but I'd just like advice on my specific situation. I've never quit a job before so do I really have to put in ""two weeks"", or can I just email and leave?  At this point it's too much frustration for not enough hours/pay, on top of my worries about Omicron (we've had our share of antimaskers too).

It was absolutely chaos. I would literally come home and cry to my husband EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I ended up getting ""laid off"" less than two months into the job. It was a huge hit on my ego since it was the first job I was ever fired from (""laid off"") due to performance. I was so embarrassed especially since I was always a top performer at all my previous jobs.

Fast forward, I found out I was pregnant shortly after getting laid off (first time pregnancy). My husband and I were beyond excited - we're high school sweethearts and had been waiting for this moment forever. He started buying furniture to build a nursery in our home. I started having some health issues and was told I was anemic and had low blood pressure. We went to our first ultrasound at 10 weeks. I was told I had a blighted ovum and would be miscarrying in the weeks to follow. We were heartbroken beyond words. I felt worthless and torn to pieces. I ended up having the miscarriage at home and suffered excruciating pain. I can't even describe what I went through. I was a mess. I was still not working so I was home all day. All I would think about was sleeping so I would not be ""living"" this nightmare. When I was awake, all I would think about was ending my life. It was torture. I hated myself. I still wanted to try for another baby but had to wait 3 months before trying again.

I ended up getting covid during that 3 month wait and suffered from it really bad. I had pneumonia and ended up in the hospital during that time. I recovered after a few weeks.  Almost two months had passed by when I found out I was pregnant again. I was so happy to be pregnant again. I was driving home one day when an idiot ran past a stop sign and hit my car. I was t-boned on my passenger side and was just in shock. It was my first car accident and my mind was still processing everything. All that ran through my mind during the impact was my pregnancy. Long story short, I ended up spotting shortly after and was taken to the hospital where I was told I was having yet another miscarriage. I felt completely numb. I thought I knew what depression was until that second miscarriage happened. It got 20x worse. It feels like every time I try to get myself out of that dark place, I keep getting pulled in deeper.

It is so hard to show up to work everyday (new job) and act like I am okay when I'm not. My boss just announced her third pregnancy following my second miscarriage which has been very hard on me. I'm happy for her but can't help but feel  resentment. I feel like a horrible person. I don't share personal information to any of my coworkers so no one knows what I have been dealing with these past months aside from getting covid and being in a car accident. I have been at this job for about 5 months now and I just want to quit. I don't feel mentally stable to be at work. I hate my current job and feel like it is only adding to my stress. I feel like the best thing to do would be to just take a break from work all together and focus on my mental health before I completely lose it. I want to quit my job but I don't know what's holding me back. I still need to do something where I can have some income coming in obviously just enough to pay bills.

I got transferred to a yard much closer to home. Awesome. 

My new crew leader is fine. The equipment driver is someone Iv worked with and get along with. 

My crew leader has to go work in my old yard for two days during my first week. When he comes back he starts bad talking all my old coworker friends, and it turns out he was talking trash about me too.

He told one of the guys at my old yard that if I’m still on his crew he will quit. Then this Friday he turned in his truck, chainsaws, and all the company equipment. He’s been with the company for more than 10 years.

I’m not the hardest worker, but I’m consistently working. He expects me to run full speed in ice/snow because he wants takes safety shortcuts. Safety is supposed to be number one priority, but he’s rushing for production. The owners want us to take time and do things safe.",1644288897.0
