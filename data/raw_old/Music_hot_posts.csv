sk4ysj,Red Hot Chili Peppers announce new album: Unlimited Love. This marks the band’s first release with guitarist John Frusciante since 2006.,6454,0.95,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sk4ysj/red_hot_chili_peppers_announce_new_album/,669,"Article: https://consequence.net/2022/02/red-hot-chili-peppers-new-album-unlimited-love-john-frusciante

Red Hot Chili Peppers will return in April with their new album, Unlimited Love. Spanning 17 tracks, the album was produced by Rick Rubin and marks the band’s first release with guitarist John Frusciante since 2006.

“Our only goal is to get lost in the music. We spent thousands of hours, collectively and individually, honing our craft and showing up for one another, to make the best album we could,” RCHP explained in a statement. “Our antennae attuned to the divine cosmos, we were just so damn grateful for the opportunity to be in a room together, and, once again, try to get better. Days, weeks and months spent listening to each other, composing, jamming freely, and arranging the fruit of those jams with great care and purpose. The sounds, rhythms, vibrations, words and melodies had us enrapt.”

“We yearn to shine a light in the world, to uplift, connect, and bring people together. Each of the songs on our new album Unlimited Love, is a facet of us, reflecting our view of the universe,” the band added. “This is our life’s mission. We work, focus, and prepare, so that when the biggest wave comes, we are ready to ride it. The ocean has gifted us a mighty wave and this record is the ride that is the sum of our lives. Thank you for listening, we hope you enjoy it. ROCK OUT MOTHERFUCKERS!”

In his own individual statement, Frusciante added, “When we got together to start writing material, we began by playing old songs by people like Johnny ‘Guitar’ Watson, The Kinks, The New York Dolls, Richard Barrett and others. Ever so gradually, we started bringing in new ideas, and turning jams into songs, and after a couple of months the new stuff was all we were playing. The feeling of effortless fun we had when we were playing songs by other people, stayed with us the whole time we were writing. For me, this record represents our love for, and faith in each other.”

As a preview, RHCP have shared the album’s lead single, “Black Summer.” The accompanying video, which you can see below, was directed by Deborah Chow (The Mandalorian, Obi-Wan Kenobi).

Success, of course, is an understatement when it comes to Rumours. The album sold more than 10 million copies during its first month out in early 1977 and eventually more than 40 million worldwide. It launched four Top 10 singles (including “Dreams” at No. 1) and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Rumours was subsequently inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry.",1643988332.0

sjsl3q,Spotify CEO addresses Joe Rogan controversy: “We don’t change our policies based on one creator”,25370,0.86,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sjsl3q/spotify_ceo_addresses_joe_rogan_controversy_we/,7895,"Article: https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-ceo-address-joe-rogan-controversy-we-dont-change-our-policies-based-on-one-creator/

Spotify CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek has addressed the company’s handling of the ongoing controversy surrounding Joe Rogan and his Spotify-exclusive podcast, The New York Times reports. “In general, what I would say is, it’s too early to know what the impact may be,” Ek reportedly said during an earnings call on Wednesday, February 2. “And usually when we’ve had controversies in the past, those are measured in months and not days. But I feel good about where we are in relation to that and obviously top line trends looks very healthy still.”

According to The Times, Ek also stated during the call:

I think the important part here is that we don’t change our policies based on one creator nor do we change it based on any media cycle, or calls from anyone else. Our policies have been carefully written with the input from numbers of internal and external experts in this space. And I do believe they’re right for our platform. And while Joe has a massive audience—he is actually the number one podcast in more than 90 markets—he also has to abide by those policies.

Along with his remarks during the earnings call, The Verge reports that Ek addressed the controversy during a town hall event with employees. “Regarding our platform rules, the fact that we hadn’t moved fast enough to make our policies available externally has made the situation especially difficult,” he reportedly said. “And these policies have been in place for years, but it was a mistake that they weren’t public. And that’s on me, and something that I will learn from.”

In December 2021, 270 medical professionals published an open letter criticizing The Joe Rogan Experience and claiming that the host has spread “false and societally harmful assertions” about the coronavirus. Since then, Neil Young has removed his music from Spotify, stating, “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” Many other musicians—including Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, David Crosby, and more—have also sought to have their work taken off Spotify in support of Young and his protest. Spotify has responded to the departures by adding content advisories to podcasts that discuss COVID-19.",1643918142.0
skknl3,Huey Lewis and the news?,125,0.67,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/skknl3/huey_lewis_and_the_news/,68,"In my opinion, their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.",1643999564.0

In my opinion the best way to describe Techno is if the music is a train going at a constant speed throughout the music without slowing down. What do you think about this topic?",1643989745.0

We all know him from his incredible contributions to Queens of the Stone Age but lets not forget his work in The Raconteurs but *especially* The Dead Weather.

His work in The Dead Weather is bloody spectacular. As some may know, it takes a lot of energy and skill to keep up with the mad man we know as Jack White lol. But Dean compliments Jack's drumming excellently and I don't think anyone could provide bette4 chemistry. I really reccomend DW's live performances to see them really shine.

Of course, he is a vital cog to QOTSA and I hope he stays in the band for years to come. Dean Fertita is a humble, hard working and extremely talented multi instrumentalist. As far as 'hired guns' go, i can imagine Dean is the go to guy for when you wanna really get shit done and create some incredible work. Just ask Beck or Iggy Pop!",1643983300.0

sk8p5o,Songs that sends shivers down your spine / makes you tear up?,6,0.8,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sk8p5o/songs_that_sends_shivers_down_your_spine_makes/,19," Doesn’t necessarily need to be because of the music itself! Could be emotion or lyrics or anything!

An example that comes to mind for me Is There Anybody Out There by Pink Floyd. Something about the way “Is there anybody out there” is said almost brings me to the verge of tears. I’m not sure exactly what it is exactly, but between the tv clips and the lonely ambience, it perfectly conveys the feeling of being completely alone. It somehow brings to mind being in outer space floating among what should be stars and planets, but you reach out and there’s nothing there. You open your eyes and all that can be seen is pitch blackness. You call out for someone to hear, but there is nothing but the sound of your own voice as you are filled with dread.

Another very different example for me is at the very end of Third Eye Blind’s Self titled album, at the very end of Motorcycle Drive By, in which it is sung :

“Summer dies and swells rise

The sun goes down in my eyes

See this rolling wave

Darkly coming to take me

Home

And I've never been so alone

And I've never been so alive”

I always feel the progression of the entire album up this point, the entire weight and emotion of the story 3eb is telling falls upon you as this song comes to a close. It’s not something I think I can perfectly describe in text, so please listen to this album in its entirety if you haven’t already. I would probably rate it as one of my favorite albums of all time

Of Monsters and Men’s Little Talks has this absolute heartbreaker of a line: 

“You're gone, gone, gone away

I watched you disappear

All that's left is a ghost of you

Now we're torn, torn, torn apart

There's nothing we can do

Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around

I'll see you when I fall asleep” 

Not sure what else to say about it. Just very sad especially considering the depressing meaning of the song.  


Finally, in All Eyes on Me by Bo Burnham the part near the end in which he sings 

“You say the Ocean’s Rising, Like I give a shit

You say the whole world’s ending, Honey it already did”

There’s something so heartbreaking, yet somehow relieving  about these lyrics. The entire *Inside* special shows Bo’s struggle with everything from his past self to the future humanity has created for itself, and yet now at the very end he is completely letting go, reasoning that there isn’t much more to be done to change the course of its fate. It’s weirdly freeing, in a strange sense, just completely letting go as he does. I still feel the need to cry everytime I hear it though.

I’m sure there are others I'm forgetting right now, but these are the main ones I can think of. I’d love to hear more examples though, so please comment with more examples!",1643964931.0

We really feel like it's a major accomplishment. The sound, the songwriting, the presentation. But it's incredibly hard to reach people.

skkmh5,Spotify vs. YouTube Music... Winner: YouTube Music!! To my absolute surprise.,0,0.44,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/skkmh5/spotify_vs_youtube_music_winner_youtube_music_to/,8,"So to my surprise, I found a service that is better than Spotify imho.  Joe Rogan receiving 100m dollars over the pennies that other artists receive, as well as the content he puts out there.... just led me to explore other options.  While I am not about cancel culture per se, I am still working out the multi-layered perspectives to this issue... All I know is that it led me to see what else was out there, if I happen to land on the decision to leave Spotify for ethical/political issues.

I watched videos and read articles - and realized I already had YouTube Premium because I like to play concerts in my house during the pandemic, and I really Hate commercials.  So for me, I bought Premium a few years ago for $17 a month.  I never explored the music aspect because I already had Spotify... although I am not the biggest fan of Spotify's radio stations because I have found I got incredibly sick of John Prine's Clay Pigeons from the repetitive play no matter if the radio station was Fleet Foxes or Nick Drake...  I found myself sick of more songs from artists who had an extensive library of music.  I used to say that Spotify's radio stations are kinda like the local radio stations, just without the commercials.

So up to this week... I tried out YouTube Music's radio stations... and I have to say the diversity and rarity of music offered was way amazing!  I also searched for favorite rare artists and they were all listed, like Kitka or Bongeziwe Mabandla or The Toure-Raichel Collective... I just wanted to share my experience with this new revelation... and not only leaving Spotify because of the gross inequity and support of a man who makes comments that make me cringe inside (see his take on who gets to call themselves black)... I have decided to switch because I have found that YouTube has everything Spotify has (I listen to my podcasts from apple), and I found it to be better!  So we are going to save $16 a month and feel good about it because not only are we saving money, we aren't supporting someone like Joe Rogan.  Yeah, I guess at the end of the day, that is how I feel about the situation, leaving Spotify because YouTube Music is better and yes, personal ethical reasons.",1643999490.0

I know it won't be easy, but I wanted to make this a challenge for myself, I got interested and who knows, maybe I'll like to keep doing it for a long time.

Since I have no idea I was wondering if that was useful, way to do it.

Do any of you have some experience creating something like that? What would you recommend me to do so that I can have an ""easier"" time?

I know playing an instrument can help, and I do have a piano but ¿Do I need some amount of skill for it to help?

Its a 4 minute dark ambient song written and released by a metal band known as Dragged Into Sunlight and the album art on the single is the aftermath of the mass suicide in Jonestown. But on streaming services, the band claims that they released the song in 1934, decades before metal and ambient music existed, and even longer before the Jonestown massacre took place. Wtf? 

The song is normal until you get halfway through when a man starts talking about doing something horrible and having to hide that part of him from everybody he meets for the rest of his life and also having to go forwards in life with the knowledge that he's a bad person but I just can't track down the source of this sample.

However I can't remember any of the words or anything that could help me just search the song. It was very indie pop with a strong 4/4 beat

In the video the main singer is a girl with dark hair wearing a suit and heals and the song is featuring another guy who I think is carrying around a sampler or synth and he is part of a catchy part in the chorus or something. The video is set in this building with just flights of stairs going up. The singer is accompanied by a whole group of people all dancing up and down the stairs to the beat of the song. The end of the video is the girl making it up to the roof and kicking the door shut I think.

The singer I think was maybe from another country originally but she's not a big name artist or anything.

I am asking because I love exploring new music. It's definitely one of my most beloved things to do, and I will listen to every single suggestion. 

For example, I am from Denmark and these are my personal picks for you to check out: 

**Alex Vargas**  
Not only do I not understand that this man is not an international superstar, I am also mindblown by the fact that he is not the most famous singer in Denmark. He has one of the most crispy voices I have ever heard, and when he hits that high note my hairs are fleeing from my arm to marry him.

**Saybia**

If you ask me this is the best danish band to have ever existed, lead by leadsinger and songwriter Søren Huss. His lyrics about love are almost considered as a national treasure to this day in the business. This band was HUGE nationally in the early 00's and people were talking about Saybia being the next big thing. Unfortunately destiny would it otherwise. Huss' wife and newborn kid was killed in a car-accident when the band was on the verge of taking the next step.  It is hard for me to say my favorite song from Saybia, but let me go with his one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1JTt\_upuQ4&ab\_channel=WarnerMusicDenmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1JTt_upuQ4&ab_channel=WarnerMusicDenmark)

She has some of the best sales of all time, consistently tops the charts and earns platinum records, can excel in any genre or any tempo, and brings it with the visuals and live performances and choreography in a way that shows a range and versatility that 99% of artists lack. Her vocal range is astounding and she can sing in many keys flawlessly, her songwriting is top-notch, and she’s an unproblematic queen with nary a scandal throughout her decades long career who uses her platform to support positive change.

There certainly are a lot of examples (think of all the songs that weren’t about drugs but everyone thought they were when they came out). I’ve got a funny one of my own.

I’m too young to remember the original Supertramp version, so the first time I heard the song “Give A Little Bit”, it was through the cover version by the Goo Goo Dolls. The band name alone surprised me at first, especially considering they’re men. And then there were the lines:

“See the man with the lonely eyes /
I’ll take his hand, you’ll be surprised”

Given those lines and the band’s name, my initial assumption was that the Goo Goo Dolls were gay and the song was about “coming out of the closet”. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Incidentally, their version switched the order of the verses to place the above lyrics earlier in the song, making them more prominent.

Of course, later on I learned the song was a cover (and that the lyrics were written about humanitarianism in general). And I began listening to other Goo Goo Dolls songs and they usually sang about women, so they weren’t a gay band, and I’ve read they apparently chose their name as a joke. But it’s still kind of a funny story. Anyone else have similar stories about songs?",1643858240.0

It's essentially to protect an artist's song from being duplicated by somebody else. 

That's still important, if I make a song I don't want somebody else just re-recording my lyrics to my instrumental and stealing listens that could of been for my original work.

But if you take 30 seconds of my song and re-interpret the melody and then write a new song, why should you have to pay me for that privilege? It seems silly, and for lack of a better word: greedy. 

What would happen if magically that rule was removed or reduced? We would have a renaissance in hip hop, for starters. 

It used to be we'd just throw those songs onto a mixtape and release it for free, ""for promotional purposes"", but that circuit has been dead for years now. Nobody really listens to mixtapes anymore. 

Before streaming was popular and there was sites for everything, we'd go to limewire for most of our music, and check [datpiff](https://www.datpiff.com/) for that free music with all the album artwork included, and life was great. 

A lot of huge artists got their start in that circuit, and part of that reason was the use of unclear-able samples in the mixtapes. Nowadays everybody just streams, if your music isn't on spotify or w/e else nobody is going to hear it, and you can't put your music on spotify if you have an uncleared sample.

In a perfect world for me, spotify would buy Datpiff and role it into it's library, having a section for 'mixtapes' and regular releases, but that just won't happen with current copyright laws.

Obviously this all ignores a lot of legal specifics of copyright law, but I think this is a discussion worth having. What do you all think?",1643828103.0

sj36zr,Music Marvel New Scam Targetting Unsigned DIY Artists?,0,0.5,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sj36zr/music_marvel_new_scam_targetting_unsigned_diy/,0,"There is a shady competition circulating the social media recently under the name Music Marvel Competition.

I was one of the artists that participated in the ''contest'' only to be later on removed and blocked [very unprofessional and childish way to deal with things] on their social media all because I asked for an explanation as to why my group (Round 1) of contestants got way lower points per vote compared to Round 2.

Round 1 (my group) would only get 10 points per daily vote for the 1st 5 days of week2 [week1 there was no voting because they told us they were using this ''latest sound technology'' to rank the artists and figure out the best 75% which sounds like a load of crap although I was among the Top 75% and was actually Top artist of Round1 & finished week4 with 12,570 points followed by a singer from Madagascar who had about 9,000 pts. I cheked the contestants' links and compared those who made it to those who got dropped only to find out that some of the people in the Top 75% literally couldn't even sing and some were totally tone-deaf not to mention those who wrote some really boring non-artistic ''songs'' (sound technology to detect good music? Lol)]. week 3 we were still on the same score system (10 points per daily vote) and it wasn't until the last 3 days of the week that we started getting 30 points. Week 4 came and we would only get 10 points per vote until the last 3 days where we started getting 50 points per daily vote.

(There were so many other res flags during Round1 and I kept telling myself to just wait and see what happens next. Example: I was Top artist of Round 1 fron the very 1st week yet they chose to showcase somebody else who was in 2nd place at the time and shared his music on thei ig [30-40 views per posts haha] I emailed them and explained how I was in 1st place coz they named him 'Top Artist' of the first week. I emailed and texted them and thet never replied)

Round 2 contestants were off to a 100 points per daily vote right from the get go (daily)!! Then later on, they would get 400 points per vote to thousands of points which resulted in a huge gap between Round 1 amd Round 2 Artists. Me being Top Artists or Round 1 only had 12,570 pts whereas this guy as Top Artists of Round 2 actually got 103,000 pts. 

They reset the scores at sme point before Round 3 (Finale) where they had all of the top artists from round 1 and round 2 put together (95/1500+ contestants).
we all had 0 points for one week, then they decided thet were gonna start the voting with scores from the previous rounds. And I went from being potentially in he top 3 to somewhere around 11th or so all because they had many artists from Round 2 that got lots of ''inflated'' bonus votes which put them 10s of thousands of points ahead of me and the rest. Honestly tho!! Me as Top Artist of Round 1 with 12,570 pts and the other guy as Top Artist if Round 2 with 103,000 pts??? Then he's in lead at the very top before we even start the Finale?? And where do I end up? 11th place? How's that fair at all?

I sent these guys a message and obvi, they didnt get back to me. Then, I commented on their latest ig post and asked for an explanation. Then almost immediately, I got blocked on their ig and instantly removed from the competition.

It was very childish, the way they reacted! It was the most unprofessional amateurish contest I've ever seen.

I found some peole's comments on their facebook posts where they were promoting their app and contest for next season and it was a post that dated back 6 days before. Certain contestants were asking how they could find out more about the competition and sounded a bit confused about the way it was being run. Remember! It had already been 6 days on that post with no reply from these guys. I replied to a couple of them and told them how I had valid reasons to believe it was all just a scam. The same exact minute, they replied to one of the comments saying the same usual crap any self-respecting scammer would: ''thanks for reaching out. we are sorry to hear... u can email us at....'' Then I got blocked on their facebook, too. For some reason, they unblocked me later on that day. The next morning, I woke up and checked my facebook only to find out that my account said it was LOCKED by facebook because of some unusual activity and that someone might have used my accoubt without me knowing. Facebook was asking me to set a new password before re-activating my account.

The first thing I thought of was their sketchy app that i logged into with my facebook account. I don't whether it had anything to do with it or not, but the app was weird. Votes would work one day and then the next day 'cannot find user' and u can't vote. they kept turning the in and off for some reason.
I was shocked when I saw the app permissions that included unlimited access to data storage (altering/deleting content) + the very high consumption of traffic while on an app that had no pop-ups, no ads, no videos ( clickable just links to artists' videos) no data consuming content! But how could use so much traffic for nothing?? sounds sketch if u ask me.

These guys are the dodgiest I've ever had to deal with. They are vert childish and so unprofessional.

(I can prove all of the above with screenshots, videos, analysis of their content and the competition + this is my own exoerience with them)

Next time u hear Music Marvel Competition take these things into account.

Stay safe, fellow artists✌
