This is stemming off of trying to listen to FLAC files off of iOS 14.8 (iPhone XR) but I can’t find anywhere to drop the file I purchased from Bandcamp.

Found the VOX media player, but when I connect my Spotify library and listen on there, it says 160 kbps and 44.1 kHz. Is that how good it should sound? Am I getting the best quality it advertises?

I feel like I can hear a very slight difference between VOX and Spotify listening to them back to back, but not sure if it’s as big as it should be.

So is this how it should sound, or am I missing something here? Thanks!",1644002812.0

But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.",1643999564.0
skkmh5,Spotify vs. YouTube Music... Winner: YouTube Music!! To my absolute surprise.,0,0.44,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/skkmh5/spotify_vs_youtube_music_winner_youtube_music_to/,8,"So to my surprise, I found a service that is better than Spotify imho.  Joe Rogan receiving 100m dollars over the pennies that other artists receive, as well as the content he puts out there.... just led me to explore other options.  While I am not about cancel culture per se, I am still working out the multi-layered perspectives to this issue... All I know is that it led me to see what else was out there, if I happen to land on the decision to leave Spotify for ethical/political issues.

I watched videos and read articles - and realized I already had YouTube Premium because I like to play concerts in my house during the pandemic, and I really Hate commercials.  So for me, I bought Premium a few years ago for $17 a month.  I never explored the music aspect because I already had Spotify... although I am not the biggest fan of Spotify's radio stations because I have found I got incredibly sick of John Prine's Clay Pigeons from the repetitive play no matter if the radio station was Fleet Foxes or Nick Drake...  I found myself sick of more songs from artists who had an extensive library of music.  I used to say that Spotify's radio stations are kinda like the local radio stations, just without the commercials.

So up to this week... I tried out YouTube Music's radio stations... and I have to say the diversity and rarity of music offered was way amazing!  I also searched for favorite rare artists and they were all listed, like Kitka or Bongeziwe Mabandla or The Toure-Raichel Collective... I just wanted to share my experience with this new revelation... and not only leaving Spotify because of the gross inequity and support of a man who makes comments that make me cringe inside (see his take on who gets to call themselves black)... I have decided to switch because I have found that YouTube has everything Spotify has (I listen to my podcasts from apple), and I found it to be better!  So we are going to save $16 a month and feel good about it because not only are we saving money, we aren't supporting someone like Joe Rogan.  Yeah, I guess at the end of the day, that is how I feel about the situation, leaving Spotify because YouTube Music is better and yes, personal ethical reasons.",1643999490.0

I've been on a binge of his work this morning and I just love the guy and his work ethic.

We all know him from his incredible contributions to Queens of the Stone Age but lets not forget his work in The Raconteurs but *especially* The Dead Weather.

His work in The Dead Weather is bloody spectacular. As some may know, it takes a lot of energy and skill to keep up with the mad man we know as Jack White lol. But Dean compliments Jack's drumming excellently and I don't think anyone could provide bette4 chemistry. I really reccomend DW's live performances to see them really shine.

Of course, he is a vital cog to QOTSA and I hope he stays in the band for years to come. Dean Fertita is a humble, hard working and extremely talented multi instrumentalist. As far as 'hired guns' go, i can imagine Dean is the go to guy for when you wanna really get shit done and create some incredible work. Just ask Beck or Iggy Pop!",1643983300.0

An example that comes to mind for me Is There Anybody Out There by Pink Floyd. Something about the way “Is there anybody out there” is said almost brings me to the verge of tears. I’m not sure exactly what it is exactly, but between the tv clips and the lonely ambience, it perfectly conveys the feeling of being completely alone. It somehow brings to mind being in outer space floating among what should be stars and planets, but you reach out and there’s nothing there. You open your eyes and all that can be seen is pitch blackness. You call out for someone to hear, but there is nothing but the sound of your own voice as you are filled with dread.

Another very different example for me is at the very end of Third Eye Blind’s Self titled album, at the very end of Motorcycle Drive By, in which it is sung :

“Summer dies and swells rise

The sun goes down in my eyes

See this rolling wave

Darkly coming to take me

Home

And I've never been so alone

And I've never been so alive”

I always feel the progression of the entire album up this point, the entire weight and emotion of the story 3eb is telling falls upon you as this song comes to a close. It’s not something I think I can perfectly describe in text, so please listen to this album in its entirety if you haven’t already. I would probably rate it as one of my favorite albums of all time

Of Monsters and Men’s Little Talks has this absolute heartbreaker of a line: 

“You're gone, gone, gone away

I watched you disappear

All that's left is a ghost of you

Now we're torn, torn, torn apart

There's nothing we can do

Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around

I'll see you when I fall asleep” 

Not sure what else to say about it. Just very sad especially considering the depressing meaning of the song.  


Finally, in All Eyes on Me by Bo Burnham the part near the end in which he sings 

“You say the Ocean’s Rising, Like I give a shit

You say the whole world’s ending, Honey it already did”

There’s something so heartbreaking, yet somehow relieving  about these lyrics. The entire *Inside* special shows Bo’s struggle with everything from his past self to the future humanity has created for itself, and yet now at the very end he is completely letting go, reasoning that there isn’t much more to be done to change the course of its fate. It’s weirdly freeing, in a strange sense, just completely letting go as he does. I still feel the need to cry everytime I hear it though.

I’m sure there are others I'm forgetting right now, but these are the main ones I can think of. I’d love to hear more examples though, so please comment with more examples!",1643964931.0

Red Hot Chili Peppers will return in April with their new album, Unlimited Love. Spanning 17 tracks, the album was produced by Rick Rubin and marks the band’s first release with guitarist John Frusciante since 2006.

“Our only goal is to get lost in the music. We spent thousands of hours, collectively and individually, honing our craft and showing up for one another, to make the best album we could,” RCHP explained in a statement. “Our antennae attuned to the divine cosmos, we were just so damn grateful for the opportunity to be in a room together, and, once again, try to get better. Days, weeks and months spent listening to each other, composing, jamming freely, and arranging the fruit of those jams with great care and purpose. The sounds, rhythms, vibrations, words and melodies had us enrapt.”

“We yearn to shine a light in the world, to uplift, connect, and bring people together. Each of the songs on our new album Unlimited Love, is a facet of us, reflecting our view of the universe,” the band added. “This is our life’s mission. We work, focus, and prepare, so that when the biggest wave comes, we are ready to ride it. The ocean has gifted us a mighty wave and this record is the ride that is the sum of our lives. Thank you for listening, we hope you enjoy it. ROCK OUT MOTHERFUCKERS!”

In his own individual statement, Frusciante added, “When we got together to start writing material, we began by playing old songs by people like Johnny ‘Guitar’ Watson, The Kinks, The New York Dolls, Richard Barrett and others. Ever so gradually, we started bringing in new ideas, and turning jams into songs, and after a couple of months the new stuff was all we were playing. The feeling of effortless fun we had when we were playing songs by other people, stayed with us the whole time we were writing. For me, this record represents our love for, and faith in each other.”

As a preview, RHCP have shared the album’s lead single, “Black Summer.” The accompanying video, which you can see below, was directed by Deborah Chow (The Mandalorian, Obi-Wan Kenobi).

The group has done an amazing job at transfering to different genres. Their on-stage presence is incredible. They have multiple cultural backgrounds thaf blend so well together. I always loves their fashion sense, always futuristic and unique. The chemistry in the group was just something else.

Its a 4 minute dark ambient song written and released by a metal band known as Dragged Into Sunlight and the album art on the single is the aftermath of the mass suicide in Jonestown. But on streaming services, the band claims that they released the song in 1934, decades before metal and ambient music existed, and even longer before the Jonestown massacre took place. Wtf? 

The song is normal until you get halfway through when a man starts talking about doing something horrible and having to hide that part of him from everybody he meets for the rest of his life and also having to go forwards in life with the knowledge that he's a bad person but I just can't track down the source of this sample. I've been looking everywhere on and off for months trying to get to the bottom of this and I just can't find anything. So please, does anybody know what this is?

However I can't remember any of the words or anything that could help me just search the song. It was very indie pop with a strong 4/4 beat

In the video the main singer is a girl with dark hair wearing a suit and heals and the song is featuring another guy who I think is carrying around a sampler or synth and he is part of a catchy part in the chorus or something. The video is set in this building with just flights of stairs going up. The singer is accompanied by a whole group of people all dancing up and down the stairs to the beat of the song. The end of the video is the girl making it up to the roof and kicking the door shut I think.

The singer I think was maybe from another country originally but she's not a big name artist or anything.

It's entirely just the two of us, Isserley and I, writing, recording, mixing, promoting, doing the art, making videos, for the entire album... (Also, it's all done remotely, we're based on opposite sides of the world from each other.)

We really feel like it's a major accomplishment. The sound, the songwriting, the presentation. But it's incredibly hard to reach people. We've got it on playlists, we've got a few reviews, some small interviews, some podcasts, but these days indie music is just an endless sea of music. I don't entirely think that's a bad thing, but it sure makes it hard to get listened to.

Spotify CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek has addressed the company’s handling of the ongoing controversy surrounding Joe Rogan and his Spotify-exclusive podcast, The New York Times reports. “In general, what I would say is, it’s too early to know what the impact may be,” Ek reportedly said during an earnings call on Wednesday, February 2. “And usually when we’ve had controversies in the past, those are measured in months and not days. But I feel good about where we are in relation to that and obviously top line trends looks very healthy still.”

According to The Times, Ek also stated during the call:

I think the important part here is that we don’t change our policies based on one creator nor do we change it based on any media cycle, or calls from anyone else. Our policies have been carefully written with the input from numbers of internal and external experts in this space. And I do believe they’re right for our platform. And while Joe has a massive audience—he is actually the number one podcast in more than 90 markets—he also has to abide by those policies.

Along with his remarks during the earnings call, The Verge reports that Ek addressed the controversy during a town hall event with employees. “Regarding our platform rules, the fact that we hadn’t moved fast enough to make our policies available externally has made the situation especially difficult,” he reportedly said. “And these policies have been in place for years, but it was a mistake that they weren’t public. And that’s on me, and something that I will learn from.”

In December 2021, 270 medical professionals published an open letter criticizing The Joe Rogan Experience and claiming that the host has spread “false and societally harmful assertions” about the coronavirus. Since then, Neil Young has removed his music from Spotify, stating, “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” Many other musicians—including Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, David Crosby, and more—have also sought to have their work taken off Spotify in support of Young and his protest. Spotify has responded to the departures by adding content advisories to podcasts that discuss COVID-19.",1643918142.0

This band was HUGE nationally in the early 00's and people were talking about Saybia being the next big thing. Unfortunately destiny would it otherwise. Huss' wife and newborn kid was killed in a car-accident when the band was on the verge of taking the next step.

The song features incredible musicianship from all three members, and it never gets boring even when only just the drums and bass are playing.

There are just two sections to learn the verse and the refrain. You'll learn them both in this video.

sj8etn,What’s it called when you hear the lyrics of a song correctly but misinterpret the meaning?,2,1.0,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sj8etn/whats_it_called_when_you_hear_the_lyrics_of_a/,2,"There’s a sub for misheard lyrics (r/mondegreens), but I’m not sure if there’s a name for people misinterpreting the _meaning_ of lyrics. There certainly are a lot of examples (think of all the songs that weren’t about drugs but everyone thought they were when they came out). I’ve got a funny one of my own.

I’m too young to remember the original Supertramp version, so the first time I heard the song “Give A Little Bit”, it was through the cover version by the Goo Goo Dolls. The band name alone surprised me at first, especially considering they’re men. And then there were the lines:

“See the man with the lonely eyes /
I’ll take his hand, you’ll be surprised”

Given those lines and the band’s name, my initial assumption was that the Goo Goo Dolls were gay and the song was about “coming out of the closet”. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Incidentally, their version switched the order of the verses to place the above lyrics earlier in the song, making them more prominent.

Of course, later on I learned the song was a cover (and that the lyrics were written about humanitarianism in general). And I began listening to other Goo Goo Dolls songs and they usually sang about women, so they weren’t a gay band, and I’ve read they apparently chose their name as a joke. But it’s still kind of a funny story. Anyone else have similar stories about songs?",1643858240.0

sj36zr,Music Marvel New Scam Targetting Unsigned DIY Artists?,0,0.5,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sj36zr/music_marvel_new_scam_targetting_unsigned_diy/,0,"There is a shady competition circulating the social media recently under the name Music Marvel Competition.

I was one of the artists that participated in the ''contest'' only to be later on removed and blocked [very unprofessional and childish way to deal with things] on their social media all because I asked for an explanation as to why my group (Round 1) of contestants got way lower points per vote compared to Round 2.

Round 1 (my group) would only get 10 points per daily vote for the 1st 5 days of week2 [week1 there was no voting because they told us they were using this ''latest sound technology'' to rank the artists and figure out the best 75% which sounds like a load of crap although I was among the Top 75% and was actually Top artist of Round1 & finished week4 with 12,570 points followed by a singer from Madagascar who had about 9,000 pts. I cheked the contestants' links and compared those who made it to those who got dropped only to find out that some of the people in the Top 75% literally couldn't even sing and some were totally tone-deaf not to mention those who wrote some really boring non-artistic ''songs'' (sound technology to detect good music? Lol)]. week 3 we were still on the same score system (10 points per daily vote) and it wasn't until the last 3 days of the week that we started getting 30 points. Week 4 came and we would only get 10 points per vote until the last 3 days where we started getting 50 points per daily vote.

(There were so many other res flags during Round1 and I kept telling myself to just wait and see what happens next. Example: I was Top artist of Round 1 fron the very 1st week yet they chose to showcase somebody else who was in 2nd place at the time and shared his music on thei ig [30-40 views per posts haha] I emailed them and explained how I was in 1st place coz they named him 'Top Artist' of the first week. I emailed and texted them and thet never replied)

Round 2 contestants were off to a 100 points per daily vote right from the get go (daily)!! Then later on, they would get 400 points per vote to thousands of points which resulted in a huge gap between Round 1 amd Round 2 Artists. Me being Top Artists or Round 1 only had 12,570 pts whereas this guy as Top Artists of Round 2 actually got 103,000 pts. 

They reset the scores at sme point before Round 3 (Finale) where they had all of the top artists from round 1 and round 2 put together (95/1500+ contestants).
we all had 0 points for one week, then they decided thet were gonna start the voting with scores from the previous rounds. And I went from being potentially in he top 3 to somewhere around 11th or so all because they had many artists from Round 2 that got lots of ''inflated'' bonus votes which put them 10s of thousands of points ahead of me and the rest. Honestly tho!! Me as Top Artist of Round 1 with 12,570 pts and the other guy as Top Artist if Round 2 with 103,000 pts??? Then he's in lead at the very top before we even start the Finale?? And where do I end up? 11th place? How's that fair at all?

I sent these guys a message and obvi, they didnt get back to me. Then, I commented on their latest ig post and asked for an explanation. Then almost immediately, I got blocked on their ig and instantly removed from the competition.

It was very childish, the way they reacted! It was the most unprofessional amateurish contest I've ever seen.

I found some peole's comments on their facebook posts where they were promoting their app and contest for next season and it was a post that dated back 6 days before. Certain contestants were asking how they could find out more about the competition and sounded a bit confused about the way it was being run. Remember! It had already been 6 days on that post with no reply from these guys. I replied to a couple of them and told them how I had valid reasons to believe it was all just a scam. The same exact minute, they replied to one of the comments saying the same usual crap any self-respecting scammer would: ''thanks for reaching out. we are sorry to hear... u can email us at....'' Then I got blocked on their facebook, too. For some reason, they unblocked me later on that day. The next morning, I woke up and checked my facebook only to find out that my account said it was LOCKED by facebook because of some unusual activity and that someone might have used my accoubt without me knowing. Facebook was asking me to set a new password before re-activating my account.

The first thing I thought of was their sketchy app that i logged into with my facebook account. I don't whether it had anything to do with it or not, but the app was weird. Votes would work one day and then the next day 'cannot find user' and u can't vote. they kept turning the in and off for some reason.
I was shocked when I saw the app permissions that included unlimited access to data storage (altering/deleting content) + the very high consumption of traffic while on an app that had no pop-ups, no ads, no videos ( clickable just links to artists' videos) no data consuming content! But how could use so much traffic for nothing?? sounds sketch if u ask me.

These guys are the dodgiest I've ever had to deal with. They are vert childish and so unprofessional.

(I can prove all of the above with screenshots, videos, analysis of their content and the competition + this is my own exoerience with them)

Next time u hear Music Marvel Competition take these things into account.

Stay safe, fellow artists✌

So I ask: what makes a ""good"" song? Is it something that differs from person to person? Are there qualities that make a song ""good""? 

Not looking for an argument here - more of a conversation. What - in your opinion - makes for a ""good"" song?",1643836171.0

I have in my mind a music video for my band's song and i am in need of other music videos for inspiration and to show bits of what's in my head to the director

I am picturing my band playing in some abandoned place at night, with actors posing as audience in some clips. The video relies a lot on cold coloured lighting (light blue, white lights) and using a very dark background only iluminating the people from behind the camera. Also using a lot of flashing lights and like that effect when It looks like like still images or slow mo due to fast flashing. Also using some slight fish eye effect to slightly deform the view and give a sense of width.

The idea is that the immersion in this studio helps an artist to discover and broaden symbolic associations within their practice and imagination, all around emotional states.

Would this type of technique interest anyone?

But i don't want to start by listening to big names such as Eminem or Ice cube, maybe Something more underrated with a Million or two of views? 

Now, i have some informations regarding my taste:

1 - i'm more used to instrumentals, so unless the instrumental uses more than two instruments, has more than two rhythyms, has long or fast notes or the lyrics themselves are frequents, i Will probably get bored.

2 - with my limited knowledge of rap music, i kinda liked Clint eastwood (Gorillaz), Godzilla (Eminem), those are the rap songs i can remember now (i have a bad memory). I also kinda liked the final part of whats up danger, but the rest of It, in my opinion, was kinda of a letdown and the ""fast"" parts didn't matched the instrumental for my taste, though i'm getting used to It.

3 - regarding hip Hop, i think i liked the soundtrack of Miles Morales stuff, i like when the beat isn't only ""tings"" and uses different notes and instruments.

It's essentially to protect an artist's song from being duplicated by somebody else. 

That's still important, if I make a song I don't want somebody else just re-recording my lyrics to my instrumental and stealing listens that could of been for my original work.

But if you take 30 seconds of my song and re-interpret the melody and then write a new song, why should you have to pay me for that privilege? It seems silly, and for lack of a better word: greedy. 

What would happen if magically that rule was removed or reduced? We would have a renaissance in hip hop, for starters. 

It used to be we'd just throw those songs onto a mixtape and release it for free, ""for promotional purposes"", but that circuit has been dead for years now. Nobody really listens to mixtapes anymore. 

Before streaming was popular and there was sites for everything, we'd go to limewire for most of our music, and check [datpiff](https://www.datpiff.com/) for that free music with all the album artwork included, and life was great. 

A lot of huge artists got their start in that circuit, and part of that reason was the use of unclear-able samples in the mixtapes. Nowadays everybody just streams, if your music isn't on spotify or w/e else nobody is going to hear it, and you can't put your music on spotify if you have an uncleared sample.

In a perfect world for me, spotify would buy Datpiff and role it into it's library, having a section for 'mixtapes' and regular releases, but that just won't happen with current copyright laws.

Obviously this all ignores a lot of legal specifics of copyright law, but I think this is a discussion worth having. What do you all think?",1643828103.0

Intro:
I'm sorry for doing this,
But I hope you understand,
Oh I hope you will let me in,
Take one more breath 

Chorus:
Oh why don't you let me in (let me in)
And I'll tell you what I did,
I will love you more (love you more)
if you did something for me,
Why don't you let me in (let me in)
I'll tell you what to do
Give you more to do.

Verse:
What I did back then
I regret it right now 
I get so overwhelmed
When you come by my side
I really hope you where my bride.

Chorus:
Oh why don't you let me in (let me in)
And I'll tell you what I did,
I will love you more (love you more)
if you did something for me,
Why don't you let me in (let me in)
I'll tell you what to do
Give you more to do.

Verse 2:
I know I will sound similar 
To someone that you know
But you trust me more right now
Than what I did back then

Chorus:
Oh why don't you let me in (let me in)
And I'll tell you what I did,
I will love you more (love you more)
if you did something for me,
Why don't you let me in (let me in)
I'll tell you what to do
Give you more to do.

Break down:
At least I like to do this
But it only happens once

Outro:
I really want to get this off of my back 
I destroyed my life 
for someone like you...
let me in.

I currently have over 70k followers and for the longest time I’ve been wondering if I should keep going with my channel or stop because I don’t know if it could help my music or hurt it actually.  I know I can start promoting my music on there and a lot of people who don’t know my band could find my music through tiktok.  

However, the thing that worries me is that my channel can be a bit vulgar at times when I try to make my videos funny and entertaining and if I hypothetically did made it big, I don’t know if people would judge me negatively because of those videos.  
Now it’s nothing horrible in terms of being vulgar, an example would be me  jokingly saying “Miguel Cabrera” sucks ass because he had one bad game.  Or another example would be me acting out a skit between two players and have one player slander the other or act drunk in front of the other.    

To sum it up, I can’t tell if me promoting my music on my channel is worth it or if I should even delete my channel because of a digital footprint.  If anybody sees this post, I’d really appreciate to hear your thoughts.",1643774709.0

High Mage Productions description:  
""Dark, effect-driven drone, spastic chippiness, synth weirdness, all encapsulated into a cohesive 30-minute story. Continuous Revelations steps away from tradition and the expected to give us this journey, one we are too happy to be on!"" 

&#x200B;

To me, the narrative these songs form is a ghost story gone to hell.

It starts with the murder of two lovers by drowning; they probably had it coming. They don't seem like nice people.

While playing this, I first envisioned a massive ship sabotaged and lost to the waves, with the lovers aware of who had orchestrated their deaths as they met their ends.  
Their bodies drown but their spirits refuse to dissipate into the next stage of their respective journeys and they wander disoriented into unknown lands. They try to come to terms with their situations, but alas, they turn on one another and then go their separate ways, losing themselves to madness and despair.

The ghosts find they can only properly interact with one another, cursed as they are, and so are grudgingly drawn back to each other. They reconcile and commit themselves to a ritual wherein they sacrifice one another's souls to hell for the payment of taking their murderer with them, trading their tormented wanderings for the satisfaction of vengeance. As they descend to hell dragging their killer with them, they experience an elated joy.  


As a listener you get to create your own narrative to go with these sounds I have conjured up. That is a wonderful thing and my interpretation is not as important as you may think, but I thought you might be entertained by reading it.

I really want to hear a remix of [Paralyzer by Finger Eleven](https://youtu.be/ZD3kCxMqjuk) done by Rick Rubin.

Pretty popular song, memey but catchy. I’ve just recently revisited it. I’ve always remembered it as a nu-metal song, probably because of its bombastic main riff. However upon revisiting, I’m now hearing a funky dance rock song. 

Call me crazy, but the slappy snare on the 2nd beat and jingly rhythm guitar during the verses evoke a funky feeling in me. 

Anyway, the only reason I chose Rick Rubin is that I’ve heard he is good at capturing the “quintessential” musician. For example, the new Tom Jones album, produced by Rubin, sounds like “quintessential Tom Jones”, if that makes any sense. That’s what some sound engineer said on a podcast, anyway.

This is the only song by Finger Eleven I’ve heard, but I’m eager to hear if their other songs are similar, because I kinda like the vibe and production of this particular song. Who knows, this may be one of those instances where I listen to a song while super stoned and get infatuated with it because solely because the guitar is jingly.

si347p,Concert Experience Discussion; Pop vs Metal,3,1.0,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/si347p/concert_experience_discussion_pop_vs_metal/,9,"For the sake of some context I'd like to mention that I've been to over 100 concerts and for a variety of music styles mostly various types of metal, edm, pop, goth rock, and witch house. I adore all genres of music. After going to so many concerts there's something that I noticed and I wanted to know if anyone else feels the same way. 

I feel like metal music gets a rep for having rough and hostile crowds but in my experience, the metal scene is probably the friendliest I've been in. And the pop crowds are actually some of the meanest. I'm going to talk about a recent experience that I had.

I won't name any artists because I don't to call a fandom out. But I went to this pop/hyperpop show and several things happened; 

* During the opening band's (they were more trap/trap metal) setlist one of the members went crowd surfing. One of the people in the crowd began punching him in the head and straight up verbally fought him when he apologized for misjudging the type of crowd he was preforming for.
* Between sets, the same girl and several others were yelling at everyone behind them to back up and stop getting so close. (Now maybe this sounds rude but; girl, you're at a concert that's kind of just how it is, if you don't like it then GA is not for you or you should hang out closer to the back because across all genres everyone is shoving everyone forward).
* This group of people started harassing security to tell everyone to back up.
* During the headlining act someone managed to squeeze up to the front. Cue another verbal fight. This lasted for the entire set.
* According to my friend who was hanging out on the balcony, he witnessed security break up 5 or 6 fights that night.

In all of my concert going years I have *never* been in such a hostile crowd. And, again, I mostly attend metal shows.  And this isn't a one off thing. Some time ago I went to see a different pop artist; while there wasn't any physical fighting people would bicker with each other over things like, 'you have to move because I can't see'. 

But with the above concert I feel like there was a major lack of concert etiquette. It seemed like a whole lot of first timers who didn't know what they were getting into (like the girl demanding that everyone backed up). Maybe it just seems that way because I vibe more/fit in better with the metal crowd. Or because I'm just used to a different scene?

Now I'm not going to say that metal crowds are perfect. I've seen my fair share of fights over guitar picks or people who had too much to drink getting into it. But generally speaking I don't see that as much and usually it's a one and done thing. At least in my personal experience. 

I guess that maybe it's just a different type of rough? Like metal has a lot of crowd surfing and moshing and there's more opportunity for physical damage so to speak. But the crowds tend to be more friendly and supportive. While the pop crowd has less physical damage but seems to be more possessive and 'every man for himself.' 

With metal it seems like the aggression is more controlled or done for fun. When someone falls they get picked up. In the same vain, I also feel like the metal crowd is much more open. Idk if that makes sense.

Another thing is that at metal shows I can just strike up a conversation or someone else will just start talking to me and we just vibe. We talk about the band, outfits, other types of music we like. With every edm and pop concert I've attended thus far, I'll try to start a conversation (same stuff; ""cute outfit"", ""what song are you hoping to hear?"" etc.) and it just kind of dies out or is ignored entirely. So I end up just kind of keeping to myself.

All of this said, I do plan on attending more pop shows. Maybe I just haven't found the right pop crowd yet lol.

So I guess I'll end with the questions; has anyone caught a similar vibe or do you have a totally opposite experience?",1643743293.0

I have zero interest in Podcasts which seems to be where Spotify is dumping their money.   

Here is what I have found so far in my search: 

We are pretty deep in to a Google Assistant eco system. Whoever is in the kitchen is always playing music and the voice control is essential while cooking. I had no idea this would limit our options! I was excited to switch to Tidal, I have heard great things about the experience and the artist payout but no integration with voice control on Google Home kills it for us. Pretty much my only options are Deezer, Apple Music, YouTube Music or Spotify.

Spotify is the only service that offers a plan for two people! It is just my wife and I, and we don't need 6 accounts. The Spotify Duo plan is perfect for us at $13.00 a month. Anywhere else we go, we will paying more money. I have had YouTube music and Apple Music in the past, If YouTube had a plan for 2 with no adds at a reasonable cost, I would deal with crappy interface but no way am paying $18.00 a month for two people. 

I have been trying Deezer but their family plan is still more money than the Spotify plan for 2, and I can't find a single benefit of their service over Spotify. I can't even find evidence they are paying artists much more than Spotify.     


I guess I am sticking with Spotify until their competitors get their act together.",1643739608.0

What was the best year in music history based solely on the albums released (not other events or when they became popular, etc.). Just based on release year. I know a lot of people cite 1967, and it's hard to argue with that one honestly.

For me, these 3 come to mind:

1975:

""Blood on the Tracks"" - Bob Dylan

""Toys in the Attic"" - Aerosmith

""Captain Fantastic..."" - Elton John

""Fleetwood Mac"" - Fleetwood Mac

""Born to Run"" - Bruce Springsteen

""Wish You Were Here"" - Pink Floyd

""The Who by Numbers"" - The Who

""Horses"" - Patti Smith

&#x200B;

1977:

""Rumours"" - Fleetwood Mac

""The Stranger"" - Billy Joel

""Peter Gabriel"" - Peter Gabriel""

""Animals"" - Pink Floyd

""Bat out of Hell"" - Meat Loaf

""Never Mind the Bollocks..."" - Sex Pistols

""A Farewell to Kings"" - Rush

&#x200B;

1991:

""Ten"" - Pearl Jam

""Nevermind"" - Nirvana

""Badmotorfinger"" - Soundgarden

""Temple of the Dog"" - Temple of the Dog

""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" - Red Hot Chili Peppers

""Gish"" - Smashing Pumpkins

""Metallica"" (The Black Album) - Metallica

""On Every Street"" - Dire Straits

""We Can't Dance"" - Genesis

""Achtung Baby"" - U2",1643737679.0

My school's symphonic band used to be one of the best in the nation (we're pretty small), and about seven years ago the band was being sent overseas for all sorts of competitions and festivals. But by some terrible luck all this faded away and right now the band is failing terribly. Most people don't practise or enjoy band anymore, the seniors can barely play a scale in tune, and once the year 4s leave (sec sch is year 1-4) this band is definitely going to collapse and possibly be shut down in our school.

Right now I'm a year 3, and the year 3s are next in line to be band leaders. I really want to find some way to save this band from being demolished in our school. There are some of us who are still very passionate about band and it's so painful to see the deteriorating quality of it all. I don't know if it'll work, but I'm determined to get this band up on their feet again - even if we don't return to the golden standard the band used to be, at least I want to try getting the band to be decent enough and fun for the members. Has anyone been through this? And how did your band manage to pull it off?

I want to believe there's still hope. I think we could revamp the band and change the culture here. I think we could add games and make band fun enough so that the kids in band actually look forward to band. How can we do that? Are there any activities or session structures that can do that?",1643693899.0

Hiya all, I've been thinking for a bit now I'd like to break away from Spotify and its BS payrate per stream to bands/artists. However, the main thing that has kept me on Spotify recently was their somewhat recent update to remove the 10,000 saved (liked) song limit for your library. This was amazing for me as I'm an avid listener of all sorts of tunes and my library is now at 17.5k songs and constantly growing.

Are there any solid alternatives to Spotify with this feature in mind? I was looking at Tidal and it seems they have a 10k limit also, and another thing that's making Spotify harder to let go is it seems their Shuffle algorithm has improved/sped up a great deal recently.

[https://youtu.be/WHchApfEIeg](https://youtu.be/WHchApfEIeg)

&#x200B;

All feedback is welcome! - I wrote this piece for a high school jazz band, give it a listen and see what you think.

&#x200B;

For those of you are that more inclined toward music theory:

I utilized a mixture of dominant seventh chords and key modulation, along with a healthy amount of dissonance, to make the edgy sounds you hear.

Piece Description:

The High Road is a contemporary jazz piece which I composed for a high school jazz ensemble. It will (probably) be performed this spring by the Flint Hill band at Arts Jam. The piece itself evokes feelings of traveling a real road; it has its ups and downs, but ultimately reaches its destination.

Though the saxophone is the main instrument, as is often the case in jazz music, the tuba plays a large role in giving this piece the foundation of its melody, despite being a monophonic instrument. The piano and guitar primarily provide dominant chords to harmonize the tune. The key modulation not only provides a good exercise for the amateur musicians this piece is intended for, but also provides the framework for developing melodies that might otherwise bore the listener. The drum beat for much of the piece is simple, however there are two drum solos that provide transitions between various sections of the piece.",1643686151.0

For me, with We Are Between by Modest Mouse, it's suuuucch a shame in my opinion because this song is hands-down one of my very favourite songs ever. Despite that though, this song just seems to HATE in-ear monitors. It still sounds... ""strange"" on headphones and speakers, and there's a LOT of 3K going on from the sounds of it, but specifically with In-Ear Monitors, I find that the pinna gain just cranks the mids of this song into a painfully screechy mess; its the only song in my entire playlist that I have to turn the volume down on to enjoy without experiencing pain. 

:( To my ears, it just sounds like the mids are sooooo forward and there's not much of a sense of stereo separation because its so loud and busy. What I would give for a remastered version of this song! (And when I say remastered, I mean levels adjusted / better dynamic range etc, not remake the song or just jack the bass or something, lol).

Tell me about your songs like this! Very interested to see what comes up and how common this is.",1643675182.0

Nothing too spectacular just the things needed to create less than mainstream quality work. I plan to spend no more than 5-600 usd. Simply because if I can't get what I want out of the studio I create sound wise, I don't want it to be too much of a loss in dollars dished out. Even if buying second hand equipment from places cuts cost slightly ie ebay, pawn shops Im not against it. One thing I want at a budget is a laptop. I recently found one on sale for $200.

Which is the

I was recommended by an employee at my local music shop that a Mac book pro is the way to go. Although I'm sure he is right simply because apple makes high quality products. My wallet would disagree. The specs that were suggested to me were at least 16gb ram & 6 core processor. The laptop I'm considering isn't half of the suggested specs. 

How big of a hindrance would buying the cheaper laptop be for running things like fl studio and or connecting beat machines and accessories.

shchd1,Is Neil Young responsible for anti-vaccine sentiment?,0,0.16,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/shchd1/is_neil_young_responsible_for_antivaccine/,29," YES. History is needed for context but it seems Neil Young has actually played a part in the problem and his past political engagement has directly influenced the anti-vax movement. Stay with me here. Some of you might not be old enough to remember when it started but GMO technology has been the boogeyman for years regarding food safety from the left. In fact, Neil Young is personally responsible for spreading misinformation regarding our food supply. It's this very type of misinformation, spread since the 90's, that has driven a lot of the fear in new technologies.....including vaccinations. Don't believe me? Read this article for more information:  [https://www.thedailybeast.com/neil-youngs-long-record-of-spreading-scientific-misinformation](https://www.thedailybeast.com/neil-youngs-long-record-of-spreading-scientific-misinformation)

Here is a quote from the article as reference: ""*Amplified by Young, the anti-biotechnology movement helped lay the foundations of the anti-COVID vaccine movement today, giving it an arsenal of misinformation to be repurposed, mainstream articles to be referenced, and misguided laws to be held up as proof of inherent dangers posed by safe technologies.""*

My first language is English but I speak a pretty good amount of Spanish as well so I have quite a few Spanish songs in my repertoire (!Selena por vida!) and I want recommendations from people on this sub about their favorite songs in their language. I would love to learn about some songs in a language totally out of my comfort zone like Chinese or Yoruba. I have little to no experience with those languages but I think it would be interesting to learn a new song in a language I don't speak. I find music to be the best way to learn about a culture.

&#x200B;

I think it would be really cool to learn at least one song in each language around the world. That is what I'm working towards. Whenever I start to learn a new song, I look for the translation in English so I can know what they are talking about and also the significance in the culture. I also like to try and research the musician and their lives. I like to use music as a starting point to go down a cultural rabbit hole. =)

&#x200B;

If you have current songs to recommend that would be great, too, but I'm most interested in those songs that EVERYONE knows. The classic songs that bring the nostalgia and touch the soul. The ones your mama and grandmama sing. Please let me know if the songs are newer or more old school. I would like to think I would be able to tell the difference but who knows! =)

My roommate is decidedly stuck in early rock and 90's grunge era music. He has said that most new rock isn't as ""crunchy"" as this stuff but would listen to it if it's out there.

I'm looking for suggestions on new rock that is ""crunchy""...

Crunchy would be stuff like:

Nirvava - Aneurysm  
Soundgarden - Jesus Christ Pose  
White Zombie - Thunderkiss '65  
Pearl Jam - Do The Evolution  
Most RATM  
Black Sabbath  
Heavily into Primus (not sure that fits crunchy)  
Zeppelin (and other early rock acts)


For him also lyrics are a big part of the music so crunchy but not vapid lyrics. English vocals as we are monolingual :(

Any suggestions on stuff made in the last 15ish years?
GVF he listened to a bit Highway Song or whatever it was called... Liked it just for the sound of Zeppelin they emulate in it.",1643650959.0

sh5mav,"Modern ""Folk"" Music has been slowly Destroying Artistic and Informed Musical Culture since Woody Guthrie Wrote his first Lyric... Change My Mind.",0,0.16,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sh5mav/modern_folk_music_has_been_slowly_destroying/,18,"I'm going to shoot from the hip here... I think Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Phil Ochs, Woody Guthrie, Peter Seeger, etc., are all talented storytellers, and hardly songwriters.

And the notion makes a good deal of sense, too: modern Folk often takes anti-establishment stands, is epitomized by emotional Instrumental simplicity, lyrical depth, and and emphasis on literal verbal storytelling over complex musical journeys. When coupled with the revolutionary culture of social protest movements, the extremity of the less-is-more mindset becomes an aversion to the nobility of true talent, thus producing perhaps some of the most untalented and societally-detrimental musicians and songs of all time.

To add insult to injury, The Folk Music Revival not only ruined public musical culture, but it also infiltrated and proceeded to denigrate most other Genres...

Solid Country Music Died in 1983. Sure, there have been resurgences over the Years, but they're all emulators of other people. Why do you think that is?

Rock and Roll, which dominated and brainwashed the world for several decades, is essentially distorted Blues: a Folk Derivative.

And Hip-Hop/Rap?... I actually deeply appreciate and admire many Old-School instrumentals and their producers (Dr. Dre and Mark Ronson, among others, are truly maestros), but most of the final cuts are ruined by the repetitive, unsung Vocals and trashy auto-tune.

The only foreseeable glimmer of hope in any possible near future for music is a mere handful of talented and Informed Synthesizer-based Artists who can comprehend Classical Structure.

...But the fact that Bob Dylan, of all people, has a Nobel Prize for Poetry under his belt... is truly a dissapointment in the Human Race. There is no doubt in my Mind that we are deep in The Kali Yuga. The Great Baroque Composers could tell the same stories without Words.",1643647402.0

There are uncontrolable external factors that makes a song famous. No amount of pop elements you put into a song and marketing can make a 100% sure hit song. 
Even if you put all the ingredients to make a pop song and invest heaps of money for marketing. People, the worlds state and random events will make a song relevant. Its not for you to decide.


I always ask myself if Im still willing to do this even if I only  have 10 fans. Yes, yes I do. Its what makes my life bareable in these hard times.

sgzsq3,Music. A tragedy.,0,0.33,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sgzsq3/music_a_tragedy/,17,"I wonder, how did we go from songs with beautiful lyrics like those found in Don't stop believing, songs like Hotel California, to songs with senseless lyrics, hardly a real instrument, and certainly no heart.

How did we go from Stevie Wonder, Temptations, Eagles, Sugarhill Gang, Tupac ...to ""Migos""?

Partly, I assume, it is that music, which used to be played simply by people who loved it, has over the years become a business.
Anything that becomes a business, is highly susceptible to becoming corrupted, especially when so many billions are involved such as in the music industry. Something about that gold evokes the nasty in us.

I also feel, as much as I believe this deterioration in quality of music is indicative of a similar deterioration in society, the same is true the other way around.
I struggle to believe that even in Michael Jacksons heyday, millions would have blindly bought a track from him just to later realise it was white noise (As had happened with a ""Tswift"" song.)
People listened to songs first, back then (I must assume). Critically reviewing the track. Do we nowadays just buy it to be hip? 
It is, at least to some degree evident now that the quality of the song does not matter, not to the degree that it used to. 
Or in the least, the quality of the song is no longer the deciding factor for many people. No longer the sole criteria upon which we decide whether or not to purchase/download a song, that is what the White noise situation signified to me. What does that mean? I'm asking. Please, I need to know.

What are these people basing their musical decisions on?

It's become a business, a market. So these ""artists"" are marketed, naturally. Is this why people go for tswift, without listening? We feel the same mindless urge to pursue their songs as we do for the Mcdonalds burger we seen on the television and on our instagram or whatever platform we use to dim our minds, under snappy phrases telling us this is the hip and cool thing to eat?

We want to fit in, feel like we are part of a tribe. I get that. But do these kids desire it so deeply they are willing to dissolve their self for that goal? They simply listen to what is promulgated to be the hip thing and BANG! they do it, without for a second wondering if THEY think it actually is fucking hip?

If so, we are in for a depressed generation. Such a deep need to fit in that they are willing to give their own selves up, can only be sourced from a dark place, some horrid abyss. But where else was humanity to go?

We are seen as nothing but commodities to push and entice towards one product or another. A global society built on money. That’s very precarious ground. Rotten ground, too. Not a strong foundation.

If you'd say no to autographs (Dave Grohl, for example, will only ""sign for charity"")..why? Does the idea that some people will use your autograph for money outweigh the fans who legitimately really want your autograph?

They covered Tame Impala's ""Eventually"". I've seen other videos of them performing the cover, but none have the quality of the CBS recording. I've looked online, and I dug through the CBS website, but I couldn't find it.

Listening to Poison's energetic snare pattern. It functions as both the snare and the hi-hat in a sense in that it rides the ""ands"" and the 4 beats. Most modern rap hi-hat doesn't occupy the ""on"" beats, and serve as the in between flavor. I'm not as up on the history and evolution of rap on into the contemporary stuff. I was curious if the snare pattern from Poison made similar appearances in other rap titles of the era, etc. In general I'm curious where Poison rests in the hearts of rap fans, as wide of a genre as it is.

Since the general concensus on this sub is that Imagine Dragons is an overrated artist, I'd have to go with 'Hopeless Opus' or 'The Fall'.

Hopeless Opus is a catchy, deep, sad but upbeat song about never reaching your full potential and wasting your life away. The guitar solo at the end is the cherry on the cake.  


The Fall is an incredibly ethereal feeling song that's about Autumn and losing faith at the same time. Everytime I listen to it I get goosebumps without fail. Such a hauntingly beautiful song.
