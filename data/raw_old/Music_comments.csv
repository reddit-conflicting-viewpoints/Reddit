rhuzow,"Lovely question . Natural woman by carol king is such a beautiful song . So powerful words and melody . 
Also across the lines Tracy Chapman . That one is a heavy hitter and there are no instruments  . I hang on her every word"
rhuzow,"Hi Joss. Paul McCartney said he wished he'd written God Only Knows, actually written by Brian Wilson. Which song do you wish you had written, creatively speaking?"
rhuzow,Why did you pick to be a Sausage on the Masked Singer?
rhuzow,"Hey Joss, have you ever considered going back and doing an album like Let It Be Naked? Just ditching all the orchestra sounds and any effects to making the tracks more ""raw,""totally stripped back and recorded live in the studio. Really like your soulful sound and good luck with the new album."
rhuzow,"'Fell in Love with a Boy' is one of my longest standing 'turn-it-up-and-sing-at-full-volume-when-alone-in-the-car' songs.  The funky baseline just gets me grooving. My question is, what is a song (by yourself or another artist) that you just can't resist belting out when it comes on in the car?"
rhuzow,"How are you not aging? I mean, I literally Googled a picture of you now versus a picture of you on The Tudors and could have made one of those 'It's the same picture' memes."
rhuzow,Why did you decide to start a podcast around the idea of happiness?
rhuzow,Do you have any anecdotes about filming The Tudors with Henry Cavill?
rhuzow,"As an artist who has done all the hard work early in your career, how do you feel about artists who gain fame and popularity by competing on talent shows such as X Factor / National Idols? Do you find it‚Äôs a useful tool that gives talent a route to good exposure, or an overly manufactured system that devalues the integrity and efforts of other artists?"
rhuzow,"Hi Joss, how has the pandemic impacted on you and your music?"
rhuzow,"How has the attempted murder impacted your life and your music? I hope you are ok, that must have been horrible ‚ù§Ô∏è"
rhuzow,"Joss, I always wondered. Where did your stage last name - Stone - came from? Its not your real last name, but you use it since ""Star for a night""!"
rhuzow,"What does it feel like to be performing at your shows, as you walk out and see all those people singing along to your songs?"
rhuzow,Hey Joss!! I know you are touring a bit in the US next year. Are you planning any gigs in the UK at all after your success with Sausage?
rhuzow,When did you first decide you wanted to be a musician for your career?
rhuzow,"What was it like working on 007 Blood Stone, being a virtual Bond girl?

I consider it the missing film of the Craig era, and you had a really prominent role as both a Bond girl and singer for the theme. I think that's a pretty unique achievement (no other Bond film or game has done the same)."
rhuzow,"Hey Joss, I saw you at Henley Festival in 2014 and you were incredible! What‚Äôs been your favourite concert? And are you playing in the summer in the UK?!"
rhuzow,"i was just thinking about your cover of the white stripes‚Äô fell in love with a girl even though i admittedly haven‚Äôt followed your career since then, apparently it‚Äôs etched into my memory."
rhuzow,"Hi Joss, the Masked Singer looks so much fun to take part in. Apart from winning (congrats), can you share any highlights / funny moments that stand out?"
rhuzow,What's it all about?
rhuzow,"Hi! Of all your songs, what is your favourite?"
rhuzow,"Hey Joss, when is the next album out?"
rhuzow,What 80s cover would you love to do?
rhuzow,"Ah yes. I‚Äôve prepared a list for exactly this occasion:

- How many people do you think have died from picking their nose?

- Why do hotdogs come in packs of 10 and buns in packs of 12?

- would you rather fight a bear with a chainsaw, or 100 ferocious marmots with your
bare hands? (To be clear- you‚Äôre wielding the chainsaw, not bear. Unless you‚Äôre feeling adventurous)

- If you could end world hunger, but had to use  sporks exclusively as the only utensil for the rest of your life, what dead celebrity would you most like to meet and why?

I‚Äôll thank you in advance for writing your answers in the correct order, double spaced, printed to A4 paper in 12pt comic sans and mailed to PO BOX 11121b, Krasnodar, Russian Federation."
rhuzow,"Not a question, just want to mention I am looking forward to buying and listening to the new album."
rhuzow,"Hey Joss, is it still at least 2 times a day üòé"
rhuzow,African or European swallows?
rhuzow,"Just saying hi, I introduced your music to my dad when your first album came out. He loved it. You‚Äôre on rotation with the Stones, Black Sabbath and UB40 now! Happy holidays!"
rhuzow,What new artist would you like to duo with?
rhuzow,Hey Joss! Which song on the new album is your favourite?
rhuzow,Hi Joss!! You did some songs with Dave Stewart after LP1 for the More Love tour such as Nowhere But Your Arms and You Couldn‚Äôt Kill Me. Are any of these songs on the new album?
rhuzow,"Hi Joss, can you tell us when the pre-order of new album starts? (I think that if it is about love it will be around Valentine's Day, am I right? :D) and are there any chances for an european tour this year, (few concerts in Poland would be great, we miss you soooo much ;)"
rhuzow,My girlfriend wants to know what your favourite cheese is.
rhuzow,"I hope you come to Argentina next year
it's not a question, it's a wish ‚ô•Ô∏è"
rhuzow,"Love your voice. But when you recorded No Man's Land for the British Legion, why did you miss out the last verse, which is the whole point of the song, laying out the waste and pointlessness of war?"
rhuzow,"Hello Joss 

I'm such a huge fan and l'm hoping you will come to Vancouver Canada üá®üá¶  any time soon. And why did you name your daughter Violet  any special reason..
God bless
Happy Holidays"
rhuzow,"Hi Joss!! I've been a huge fan of yours ever since I saw the music video for ""fell in love with a boy"" when I was 15. LP1 has been in my CD player/alarm clock for I can't even tell you how long. I've probably listened to ""Never forget my love"" about 10 times since I saw it pop up on Spotify (it's a fantastic song). You are an incredible artist and an amazing person. You've probably had some awesome experiences in your life. What was your biggest ""oh my God, I can't believe this is actually happening"" moment you have had?"
rhuzow,"Can I ask you, who was your most important musical influence growing up? Who is inspiring you currently famous or unknown to make new music?

I think you are an awesome artist! I am a small producer myself but i make mainly electronic music. I can only imagine how easy it would be to work with somebody like you, your vocals and range would be amazing to use!

I wish you all the best with your future endeavours!!!"
rhuzow,What is Joss short for?
rhuzow,Who's your favourite rapper?\`
rhuzow,"This may be a bit of a blast from the past; what was it like recording ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Take It All‚Äù? The title song for the James Bond video game, ‚ÄúBlood Stone‚Äù.

You also provided your voice & likeness for a character in the game, Nicole Hunter. How did that come about?"
rhuzow,How was working with mick Jagger?
rhuzow,Why did you start talking in a really fake American accent ?
rhuzow,"Hi Joss, i am a young music enthusiast, who would like to try and make some music of his own. What editing program would you recommend? And thank you :-)  best regards Elias"
rhuzow,"Hi Joss, just wanted to ask how your day is going? I‚Äôve been a longtime fan and have introduced you to lots of friends. My favorite memory involving your music-One time I was having such a shit day, so I grabbed my tanning lotion, stereo and my Joss Stone CD and laid out in the sun, I sang with every song and ended up dancing barefoot in the grass :) my day was 100% better! This was over 15 years ago ;)"
rhuzow,Hi Joss! Is there any particular song you have covered in your career that is your favourite?
rhuzow,this will be the longest release gap between any of your albums. is there any particular reason behind that?
rhuzow,"Hi! ‚ù§Ô∏è 2004 was the year you released Mind, Body & Soul. That‚Äôs 17 years ago! Wondering what goes through your mind now when you think of 2004?"
rhuzow,"Hey Joss will you be doing bundles for your new album like vinyl, CD, cassette, signed stuff etc on your official store?"

rhuzow,"Hey Joss, waiting for the show at Rock In Rio in September! It will be great to see you and Guns N' Roses on the same night. About the album ""The Soul Sessions"", can we expect a Volume 3 in 2022?"
rhuzow,"Hi Joss,  I saw you live with Jools Holland a few years ago in the UK and it was a fantastic show - one of the best live performances I've seen. I was wondering what are some of your favourite live performances by other artists that you have seen?"

rhuzow,"Hey Joss, when did you feel ‚ÄòI can really pursue this as a career?‚Äô Like was it always, or did you reach a certain point where you could feel the momentum carrying you forwards?
Also any advice to anyone starting out? Is 26 too old to start a fresh music career?

Sorry for all the questions haha - love your work!"
rhuzow,"Once. I went to a bonnaroo music fest a long time ago. I was given an Artist CD , which has a song on it that I fell in love with. 

To this day, Right to be Wrong, is forever burned with the amazing memories of that weekend and learning a new artist that has stayed with me ever since.

rhuzow,"Hi Joss, we share the same birthday! Have you ever met our birthday sharers Dele Ali, Lisa Stansfield or Cerys Matthews?"
rhuzow,"No questions, just wanna say I've been a fan for ages. I can still recall you on the podium when I saw you on TV for the first time, that was just before your first album I think.

When I'd gotten into reviewing audio equipment, I usually had that album on hand. Even tho the mixing wasn't the best IIRC, it was always a good listen.

Anyway, keep it up."
rhuzow,"I don't have a question; I just wanted to say your version of I Put a Spell on You with Jeff Beck changed my life. I don't mean that insincerely. As a performer and audio engineer, that song has served as a golden reference to which I compare my work for years.

Thanks for kicking ass!"
rhuzow,"Joss, please come back to Argentina:‚Äô)"
rhuzow,Would you work with Jeff Beck again?
rhuzow,"I absolutely love you. I've had a crush on you since you were 17 and me 16. I once dreamt we were dating and it was such an disappointment to wake up!!

I love your voice. Keep it real I know you will!! Pls come to Chile soon and I can introduce you to my family"

rhuzow,"Hey Joss, I remember watching you on Punk'd, how do you feel about how you were portrayed on that program?"
rhuzow,"I don't have a question. I just want to say, wow, you are radiant."
rhuzow,"Hey Joss! üòá 

I remember when I used to live in Puerto Rico as a young teenager, my mom got your first couple albums and I absolutely fell in love with your music. Over the years, I've listened to how you're music has evolved yet somehow maintained the same essential roots that makes them distinctly yours. 

My question to you is this: How have you managed to stay inspired to write and create your music after all these years? As an artist, do you ever find it difficult to stay inspired? 

By the way, Proper Nice is my favorite song of yours. =) 

Have a lovely day! And thank you for doing this AMA. I was not expecting to see you here. It was such a pleasant surprise.

- Joel"
rhuzow,Damn. Joss Stone is hella nice and better looking now than ever. What‚Äôs going on.
rhuzow,"Dang, Joss Stone on Reddit lol, I played ‚ÄúFree Me‚Äù on a cover band a couple years ago and damn was that fun (still play it somewhat often).

rhuzow,"Would you consider recording one of my original(ish) tunes?
This is a happy happy happy song"
rhuzow,"I hope that wasn't offensive. They were two podcasts. 
I love you rendition of Here Comes the Rain Again. It lends itself perfectly to your voice
What has been the most challenging song for you to write or perform"
rhuzow,who are you
rhuzow,Can I sing with you?
rhuzow,answer is on video
rhuzow,Do you miss being relevant?
rhuzow,....who?
rhuzow,Why were you so mean to Gal Gadot and Charisma Carpenter?

rhuzow,Who dis?
rhuzow,No
rhuzow,What advice can you suggest to a musician (family band/2 teens & their Dad in our case) that will be new to the world of streaming our originals in order to try to capture &/or gain a broader audience in such a vast sea of talented musicians today? My husband thinks the best route is continuing live performances and trying to expand into larger venues but without streaming one becomes dependent on the other I think?  Have long been a fan of your music! Happy wishes to you this new year.
rhuzow,Your favorite song that you ever recorded
rhuzow,what is your Best color
rhuzow,I always like the same music when I am relaxed
rhuzow,The real Joss Stone? or this is just some joke
s8m1uh,Never fails to bring a tear to my eye

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Can you guess what makes a sound other than a person before the little girl does?  I don't believe I did the first time I heard it. =D"
s8m1uh,This whole album is fucking tiiiiiiight
s8m1uh,SUCH a good video!
s8m1uh,Love this song and this video.
s8m1uh,"Genuine question, why is ""plunderphonics"" always used as a genre to describe them? I feel like it is always the label used, and I've never heard it used for any other group/act."
s8m1uh,Glad it's not Frontier Psychiatrist again. This and [Frankie Sinatra](https://youtu.be/SjfspM5sDIA) should be bigger.
s8m1uh,"It's an incredible video and just such a joyful song, not sure there's many better combinations of song and music"
s8m1uh,It's always nice to see miners behaving respectably.
s8m1uh, This is one of my favorite music videos of all time.
s8m1uh,This album is incredible. I think it's such a vibe it's almost a shame to listen to one song. I put it on for the first time and the first notes made me feel like I was on vacation. Then it really takes you on a journey.
s8m1uh,"One of my favourite bands. Had the pleasure of seeing them live a few years back after the release of Wildflower and they killed it.

Their new album is great too."
s8m1uh,Brilliant song and video. I got to see them live (21 years ago!) and they were awesome
s8m1uh,This brings me back to high school and getting broken up with. About a week after the fact my ex had this song up on her myspace.
s8m1uh,Still slaps and what a vibe.
s8m1uh,This is wonderful!
s8m1uh,"It‚Äôs nice to be reminded. Damn, that‚Äôs sweet in the best way possible."
s8m1uh,i used to do chiptune plunderphonics. took a long time to build up a sample library.
s8m1uh,Beautiful and tragic video!
s8m1uh,"Avalanches are the best, love their music"
s8m1uh,Always a great tune.
s8m1uh,One of my favorite videos.  I just love everything about it.
s8m1uh,"I'm in Hawaii and the opening line is stuck in my head. ""Get a drink, have a good time, welcome to paradise!"""
s8m1uh,"There are a lot of people that apparently really love this, but I really don‚Äôt get it at all. Seems very standard and one dimensional to me, maybe I just need to hear more of their music or see more of their videos. I guess I just don‚Äôt get what all the fuss is about"
s8m1uh,an eternal fave.
s8m1uh,"Go subscribe 
https://youtu.be/rTX6Dvju1Qo"
s8m1uh,"I wish their newer albums were better.  They just don't have the same emotion as the first.

Edit:

Not sure why this comment is -1.  There's really no reason to be downvoting someone's basic opinion on this subreddit.  You're using the feature improperly and breaking the rules of the sub."
s8dqe7,German version by a wide margin.
s8dqe7,Luftballons.
s8dqe7,"The word ""red"" was added in the English translation merely so that it had the same number of syllables.

""99... baloons"" just didn't sound good."
s8dqe7,Hast du etwas zeit f√ºr mich?
s8dqe7,I prefer the Goldfinger version
s8dqe7,"Luft

I just speak English but the German version is so great


Also an older one called Sukiyaki which is in Japanese and is wonderful but the English version is not so much"
s8dqe7,I like the punk version by 7 Seconds
s8dqe7,[Dead Baboons](https://youtu.be/kRpcEFJL1_8)
s8dqe7,German version sounds so much better
s8dqe7,Goldfinger's version with a bit of both English and German is my preferred version.
s8dqe7,English version by Goldfinger.
s8dqe7,"99 Luftballons, even when I was younger my dad and I always agreed that the German version was better. My dad said the only reason they made the english version was for Americans haha. But German version all the way, nostalgic song for me."
s8dqe7,Luftballons
s8dqe7,Gold fingers version... they do half of it in german when it matters.
s8dqe7,"I prefer the English version since I think it tells a better story than the translated German lyrics - how in German, the jet fighter pilots identify the balloons as UFOs and decide to attack, which leads to war, while in English, there is no mention that the balloons are ever identified, they just float innocently by while the entire world commits to war without any understanding of what they're reacting to, which parallels a lot of Cold War launch-on-warning themes where completely innocent things could escalate tensions because there was always a standard response.

I know Nena refuses to sing the English version and that's fair.

[Side by side comparison of German, literal translation and Nena's English lyrics.](http://www.inthe80s.com/redger3.shtml)

Edit: haven't read the lyrics in a long time. Clarified my answer."
s8dqe7,"Original.   Same with Falco's ""Der Kommissar"".  The English cover by After The Fire makes no sense.... and I'll be forever perplexed why ATOMIC BLONDE, which takes place in East Berlin of the 80s, uses the English version (I'm betting it was a sync rights issue, but they should have just forked over the money) yet uses German versions of other songs including a re-recording of 99 Luftballons by Gabi Kerner of Nena."
s8dqe7,The goldfinger version is the best version.
s8dqe7,Red Balloons but it must be the Goldfinger version.
s8dqe7,The happy hardcore version.
s8dqe7,[Both if you're Goldfinger](https://youtu.be/5szuJsQzScA)
s8dqe7,SUBS > DUBS
s8dqe7,"99 Red Balloons by Goldfinger. I don't get why people are complaining about them adding ""red"" to the title. Without it, it wouldn't sound right. What's wrong with making it sound good?"
s8dqe7,"99 Luftballons of course. 
I agree, the german version sounds better."
s8dqe7,I remember a parody version. ‚Äú99 Dead Baboons‚Äù
s8dqe7,The goldfinger version that uses a bit of both
s8dqe7,The Goldfinger cover
s8dqe7,Goldfinger.  That is the only correct answer.
s8dqe7,LUFTBALLONS üéàx99
s8dqe7,"Goldfinger‚Äôs, easy"
s8dqe7,[99 Dead Baboons](https://youtu.be/kRpcEFJL1_8) by Tim Kavanagh
s8dqe7,I like the cover by Goldfinger. It's got a verse in English AND a verse in German.
s8dqe7,I like the German but what I really like even more is the Goldfinger cover of this song.
s8dqe7,The goldfinger rendition
s8dqe7,"The Goldfinger version is the clear winner, best of both worlds"
s8dqe7,Goldfinger version or bust.
s8dqe7,"I have a fond spot for 99 Luftballons, because a coworker and I spent a whole shift once listening to Nena.

99 Red Balloons though, I prefer the Goldfinger cover, especially because they blend the German and English lyrics."
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons until we are talking about Goldfinger
s8dqe7,Auf Deutsch
s8dqe7,"99 Red Balloons - love the accented English, very unique and interesting"
s8dqe7,"English but only cuz i love the line ""Everyone's a superhero  
Everyone's a Captain Kirk""."
s8dqe7,"Don't worry, Nena didn't speak any English either. She learned and sang the English version phonetically."
s8dqe7,I speak both German and English and I prefer the German version. The lyrics and the flow are better.
s8dqe7,"I like the English version because I understand the lyrical meaning, and not just the up beat melody."
s8dqe7,Definitely the German version.
s8dqe7,"German version, always. This also counts for Das Model by Kraftwerk"
s8dqe7,"I prefer the German version by Nena over the English one, but I equally like the English version from Goldfinger"
s8dqe7,the german version
s8dqe7,"I prefer the Goldfinger Grand Turismo 3 Soundtrack Version of the song. - No german, instead they sing verses in english.

I just like the upbeat ska version, as opposed to the slow german electronic version."
s8dqe7,"As a cultured norwegian, only the DDR version will do:

https://youtu.be/cTHfc6NgWKQ"
s8dqe7,"German one is  so much fun to sing along with:

> Neunundneunzig Luftballons

> *muffled, vaguely german sounding noises, pretending I know the words*

> Captain Kirk!"
s8dqe7,My American husband used to work on an airbase in Germany. Taxi driver who picked him up one day had the English version playing. He asked if he could change it and the taxi driver perked up and switched to the German version with glee.
s8dqe7,There are two versions. You don't have to pick one. Both of them exist.
s8dqe7,Neunundneunzig Luftballons auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
s8dqe7,It‚Äôs much better in Klingon
s8dqe7,"Luftballons. Aside from it just being better, German as a language is inherently ill suited to music so the fact that it works in German should be appreciated"
s8dqe7,99 Red Balloons. Grew up with that one. The English one is catchier to me. The original one is actually prettier.
s8dqe7,"The German version sounds better, but I also prefer it because of my grandmother. She was born and raised in Germany and lived there until around her 30‚Äôs. She lived with us because my grandparents divorced and my mom was a single mom. I grew up hearing her German accent and now that she‚Äôs gone I miss it so much. It‚Äôs what I want to hear more than anything. For me, listening to songs in German is comforting. I also loved Elvis Presley‚Äôs ‚ÄúWooden Heart‚Äù because he sings part of it in German."
s8dqe7,"I like the German version much more. The music is much more powerful.

Goldfinger's version is also pretty good (I'd put it between the German and Spanish versions by Nena)"
s8dqe7,red translated is **rot**.   Air translated is **luft**
s8dqe7,"Just a reminder that the singer, Nena, is hardcore in on the covidiot / queerdenken movement."
s8dqe7,Did you know that Nena encouraged her fans to ignore hygiene rules at a concert in Berlin and also attended a party with lots of people from the QAnon movement?
s8dqe7,The original German version is 100% better than the lame English translation.
s8dqe7,"as a german, i will commit homicide if i ever hear that song being played in english"
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons metal cover by Leo Moracchioli
s8dqe7,What is 99 red balloons?
s8dqe7,The balloons are not red in the original Nena German version. Luft is 'air' auf Deutsch.
s8dqe7,Luftballons always.
s8dqe7,Luftballoon. I enjoy it the way it was meant to be.  It didn't really need an english version.
s8dqe7,"German one 100%.

Same with Irgendwie Irgendwo Irgendwann vs the English covers."
s8dqe7,"I first heard this, in its original German of course, in West Berlin when there still was a West Berlin. So I‚Äôve never felt any real affinity for the English version. West Berlin was a kind of a crazy place, full of youngsters who had moved there to avoid their National Service. This was a perk granted by the West German govt to encourage people to live there."
s8dqe7,"99 Luftballons, specifically because the song is written in German and fits with the German cadence.

/speaking about a blast from the past."
s8dqe7,"After listening to the German version, I concur this version is elite. Anyone have recommendations on more German music to get into? I took 4 years of German back in HS and I miss this language...oddly beautiful to my ears."
s8dqe7,"I prefer the German by Nena. But my favorite version is the cover by Gold finger, they use both languages."
s8dqe7,"German version, always.

I only speak english, but listen plenty of music not in english. Don't necessarily need to know the lyrics to be a banger."
s8dqe7,"German version, so much better!"
s8dqe7,The Goldfinger version was my favourite.
s8dqe7,I love the Goldfinger version. It has a bit of both. Kinda like Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads
s8dqe7,The Goldfinger cover gives you the German & English lyrics - https://youtu.be/p-qfzH0vnOs
s8dqe7,The English version was a dud. Everyone thought it sounded best in German.
s8dqe7,"The German version definitely flows better

But Goldfinger‚Äôs version is still the best banger."
s8dqe7,"Unpopular opinion time, I think the Goldfinger cover is the best version of this song."
s8dqe7,Goldfinger version have the answer to this. Both. And it's the best version IMHO.
s8dqe7,"I was 18 when it came out. Every guy was in love with the singer until her pits were noticed...

ü§£ü§£ü§£"
s8dqe7,There‚Äôs an English version?
s8dqe7,There is a Jay-Z/Nena mashup which is my favorite
s8dqe7,Lazy Jones soundtrack.
s8dqe7,both
s8dqe7,i prefer the 7 Seconds version.
s8dqe7,Porque no dos? I love both versions.
s8dqe7,captian kirk is captian kirk in both versions...
s8dqe7,Listen to kaleida's version of that song it's superb
s8dqe7,"The best line in the English version is ""Worry worry super scurry call the troops out in a hurry."""
s8dqe7,The Homer Simpson version
s8dqe7,7 Seconds version >*
s8dqe7,Goldfinger version all the way
s8dqe7,This is the one case in the universe where it's acceptable to like both versions. I remember the English version reaching number one in the UK charts and loved it and her. Then I heard the German version years later and i loved that too.
s8dqe7,"I just like the line in the English version

""flash the message, somethings out there"" 

That line always stuck with me."
s8dqe7,The 7 Seconds version is best version.
s8dqe7,Luftballons. It's easier to dance to when you don't realize it's about nuclear apocalypse
s8dqe7,German version.
s8dqe7," I love them both, the original because its better, and the Goldfinger version because I like Goldfinger."
s8dqe7,"99 Red Balloons, floating in the summer sky-

While driving a PT Cruiser in a race.

Wait why is it slowing down..."
s8dqe7,99 red balloons because I don't speak German and like to sing along.
s8dqe7,"German version is definitely better bay fat, but English has some cuteness to it. I like to hear them both"
s8dqe7,"As I heard the German version a few years before the English one, definitely the German version!  Even though I had no idea what it meant.

By the way, the same goes for Peter Shilling's ""Major Tom"", which to me is a much better song, especially in german."
s8dqe7,I didn't even know there was an English version...
s8dqe7,Translated songs sound weird. I prefer the original.
s8dqe7,This song is GOAT in either language
s8dqe7,luftballoons
s8dqe7,"I don‚Äôt remember enough from my high school German days to follow the lyrics, but I distinctly remember the original German being a much darker story than the English sort-of translation. I fact, I was in my 40s (I was in high schoolWhen the song came out) before I realized the song is about accidental nuclear war and not an alien invasion. That‚Äôs how badly the English translation mangled it (that and the Captain Kirk reference)"
s8dqe7,"I grew up with the English version, so that‚Äôs the one I know."
s8dqe7,I have a 45 with both of them! I don't speak German but I enjoy both equally.
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons
s8dqe7,Luftballons
s8dqe7,Luft for Life
s8dqe7,die deutsche version by far!
s8dqe7,"Neither, it's depressing."
s8dqe7,I like the way the German sounds like noina-noina.
s8dqe7,Yes
s8dqe7,"Luftballoons. Cmon, man."
s8dqe7,You have not experienced Nena until you have heard her in the original Klingon!
s8dqe7,I hate both.
s8dqe7,I don't speak German but can recite Rammstein's Du Hast pretty well.
s8dqe7,For me out here is Asia it was difficult to get the German version. So when I got one i brought it to school to show everyone! I like the German version !
s8dqe7,"The German version is far better.  The English version is basically a different song.  My only gripe with the German version is that it sounds to me that she's singing ""neunundneunzig"" in a way to make it sound like ""ninety nine"" in English, which makes the song more marketable in the US, but might just be her accent.  The song is great, though, and a great example of  anti-nuke rock."
s8dqe7,"I like 99 Red Baloons for the ending lyrics:

""If I could find a souvenir

Just to prove the world was here

And here is a red balloon

I think of you, and let it go...""

Beautiful...

But the German version is really good too."
s8dqe7,This version is tops‚Ä¶ https://youtu.be/OWiigbnIprs
s8dqe7,This isn't even up for debate.
s8dqe7,Prefer this version the best https://youtu.be/kRpcEFJL1_8
s8dqe7,"Prefer German, am English speaker"
s8dqe7,"I sing along too, but with made up words. ‚ÄúShlocken glocken minah gorgen‚Äù"
s8dqe7,"First time i heard it, it was ""Luftballon"" and that's the version I grew to like. When the ""Red Balloon"" version came out it sounded all wrong to me."
s8dqe7,For some reason I always think the lyric is 19-90 red balloons
s8dqe7,I would like to hear a German version that was based on translating the English translation back to German.
s8dqe7,Both versions are great
s8dqe7,Luft x 100
s8dqe7,"Neither, as i don't like this song."
s8dqe7,English only speaking people who prefer the German Version up vote here.
s8dqe7,The lyrics in Nenas version tell the same story but in a more amicable and personal way whereas the lyrics in German version seem more sinister and more like a history book. I love both its hard to choose between them.
s8dqe7,"German, no question."
s8dqe7,There was a racing game(gran turismo 3 I think) with like six songs on the soundtrack including this one so it‚Äôs ingrained in my head pretty bad.
s8dqe7,"Honestly, I always feel like the original is better 99% of the time, so I gotta go with German. Take a look at any song that has been translated from its original language and you will see some liberties taken with the lyrics, which is a necessary evil, so that the song will still flow. Even Disney isn't exempt from this travesty, and they've got enough money to do *almost* anything correctly."
s8dqe7,"used to sing this song in a band i was in back in college. we did red balloons, but i had a habit of getting a lil tipsy before shows and if I blanked on a verse id just start singing the verse in german to the best of my ability. nobody knows if you make a mistake there as long as there are no germans in attendance."
s8dqe7,I still find both versions equally cringy.
s8dqe7,Neun und Neunzig Luftballoons is the best
s8dqe7,Almost like it was written in German first.
s8dqe7,I like luft version better but both are good
s8dqe7,Honestly the English version.  They did a good job translating the lyrics (everyone's a Captain Kirk!) and I don't speak German
s8dqe7,Luftballons and I only speak English and a little Spanish.
s8dqe7,"Luftballons. No contest, I can't even stand 99 Red Balloons."
s8dqe7,I bet the the YouTube algorithms are trying to figure out what there's a massive surge in traffic for both versions today. :)
s8dqe7,"The rhythm is the same, so yes.  Then afterwards we sing the polish one, which had a different rhythm and to which I don't know the words so I just say Happy Birthday stuff along to song."
s8dqe7,"this was a cool take on it also:

https://youtu.be/EoZQRHri3mA

(John Forte, Wyclef et al.)"
s8dqe7,why not both ?
s8dqe7,Luft beats red by miles and miles
s8dqe7,"Yes, I've sung just the Neunundneunzig Luftballons/Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont part of the chorus ever since I heard it in the 80s and my pal David Zurbrugg wrote it down for me."
s8dqe7,"Luftballoons, it‚Äôs the og"
s8dqe7,Both
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons so much better!
s8dqe7,"German is my native language, so 99 Luftballons all the way!!"
s8dqe7,"Red Ballons, anyone who says otherwise is a try hard"
s8dqe7,German but I speak German and also relied on this song a bit to help me learn haha
s8dqe7,I was born in the early 90's so I gotta say the Goldfinger version
s8dqe7,The former
s8dqe7,"I first heard the song in German while living in Germany. Only after returning to the US did I hear the English version.

They did a great job reworking the lyrics for English. But, it definitely loses something in the translation."
s8dqe7,"How original. An American who prefers the German version of 99 Red Balloons. Wow, you're unique."
s8dqe7,Liz Lemon‚Äôs.
s8dqe7,The original song (German) is WAAAAAY better. Also the lyrics are about the balloons used to pass messages over the Berlin wall.
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons is superior. Everyone knows that.
s8dqe7,Luftballons all the way
s8dqe7,99 Luftballons all day long. The English version is nowhere near as good as the German version.
s8dqe7,"Go subscribe 
https://youtu.be/rTX6Dvju1Qo"
s8dqe7,"It makes sense, considering that it was originally written in German, and the English version is a loose translation.

I heard long ago that Nena (the artist) didn't speak any English, and basically had to learn the English version syllable by syllable. Don't know if that's true, but I thought it was kinda interesting."
s8dqe7,"Luftballons is far superior; I don't speak a word of German

Also check out Nena's other work! Incredible artist that is often overlooked purely because of one massive hit"
s8dqe7,Luft balloons. 100% amazing in Grosse Point Blank
s8dqe7,The goldfinger cover is the superior version with the best of both worlds
s8dqe7,"Du hast ihn gekauft und ich habe es gesehen

Shameless plug of the other 80's german song"
s8dqe7,Neither.
s8dqe7,"these german to english cover songs always seem to turn to shit, after the fire's cover of ""der kommissar"" is another one that comes to mind"
s8dqe7,99 luftballons for sure. I like both but definitely the German version is the OG version and the best version.
s8dqe7,100% German version!
s8dqe7,I still can't get my head around Peter Gabriel being able to sing several albums in multiple languages
s8dqe7,Also check out the Beatles‚Äô German versions of ‚ÄúShe Loves You‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Wanna Hold Your Hand‚Äù.
s8dqe7,I usually add the English version just cause then I can sing along.
s8dqe7,The German version is much better.
s8dqe7,It‚Äôs originally a German song. Always original.
s8dqe7,"Luft. Don't speak German except for a bit in school, but i like hearing people sing it."
s8jx84,AOF is great. I personally like Secret Treaties just a bit more but that is probably because I heard it first. The live record they did after AOF is pretty killer too.
s8jx84,I always considered BOC psychedelic rock. I've never heard anyone call them heavy metal that's so weird to me.
s8jx84,"I was 13 in 1976, and just discovering 'cool music' for the first time. An amazing time to be alive, for sure... and yes, I'm very familiar with AoF.

If you have a Spotify account, [here's my 1976 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2xsNKyStXgwB6MwGNN4oH7?si=37c5b9f8a109483a). It's 44 songs by 44 different artists, all of them bangers. (""Reaper"" is track #33.)"
s8jx84,"I here people list their rankings of BOC albums and it seems like they are afraid to rank ‚ÄúAgents of Fortune‚Äù high because it is the chalk pick.

I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the chalk, ‚ÄúAgents of Fortune‚Äù is my #1 and a fantastic album."
s8jx84,I‚Äôve listened to ETI twice today by coincidence.
s8jx84,‚ÄúAgents of Fortune is a total fuck album‚Äù - The Stoned Age
s8jx84,More Cowbell!
s8jx84,You're damned right!
s8jx84,My first concert.  Academy of Music (long gone) in NYC.  Summer of 1974.
s8jx84,"Great album, absolutely horrendous album cover."
s8jx84,"I just wanna know how they got Patti Smith to guest vocal on Blue √ñyster Cult song (Vera Gemini) üòä Always thought that was an odd pairing.

I‚Äôm a bigger fan of the first 3 ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù albums, more my style, but this one is great for sure.

Actually their 2020 release ‚ÄúThe Symbol Remains‚Äù ain‚Äôt bad, surprisingly!

My first show was in the 70‚Äôs, must have seen ‚Äòem a dozen times."
s8jx84,What about if you play it loudly?
s8jx84,Love that album. Such a great guitar player imo
s8jx84,I've actually seen them perform this album in it's entirety but out of order =p  They toured with a backup guitar player for like 6 mos a few years back and he only had time to learn 1 record the first week.
s8jx84,Even Debbie Denise hits me hard
s8jx84,Loved this album since I was 16. So much variety.
s8jx84,*Secret Treaties* is even better.
s8jx84,"I saw them live a few years ago in Portland. Holy shit these guys still rip. There was an awkward younger third guitarist, but the main two guys were shredding the whole time. They gotta be like 70, it was awesome."
s8jx84,"That whole album is so strong. Not a single weak song. I've always really, really liked the closer ""Debbie Denise"" a lot too.

I hadn't listened to them in a while, and randomly checked out their latest album from 2020(!)--The Symbol Remains. It's really good too."
s8jx84,"I would like to suggest Harmonium by Harmonium. 

So good, like comfort food for your ears

70‚Äôs prog rock"
s8jx84,Imma peep!
s86gam,"My favorite song on Bad Co. the album, by Bad Co. the band, is Bad Co. the song."
s86gam,"Yes

Try tons of sobs by free. Paul Rogers was 19 then and sings just as good. Bassist 15! Paul Kosoff was one of the most incredible Les Paul heroes, and 18yo here I think. It's one of the craziest phenomenons in music that these high performing teenagers made this in 1968 and released such a heavy dark blues record before the likes of Led Zeppelin"
s86gam,"I have an older buddy who grew up when these guys were big. For reference, he‚Äôs a fan of Bruce, Steve Earle, and David Allen Coe, but he also dug some popular rock like Cheap Trick. Despite being too young at the time, I became a fan of Bad Co later in life.

I asked him what he thought about them, and he said he didn‚Äôt care for them because they never told stories.

In response I started badly singing ‚ÄúJohnny was a school boy when he heard his first Beatles song‚Ä¶‚Äù"
s86gam,"Almost every day around noon, this starts running repeatedly through my mind:

*I‚Äôm ready for lunch*

*Oh baby, I‚Äôm a-ready for lunch*"
s86gam,"Paul Rogers is one of the most underrated singers of the British Invasion. Killer range and soul but seldom as high up on any list as he deserves IMO.

Check out Savoy Brown. Another underrated Brit Invasion blues rock band from the same era with a more folk & big band horns fusion style."
s86gam,"I still listen occasionally.

Bad Company..  I can't deny."
s86gam,Any LPOTL fans immediately start singing it in Henry‚Äôs voice?
s86gam,Paul Rodgers is a great singer. There‚Äôs a great video of him singing with Queen from several years ago that is really good too.
s86gam,Run with the pack is my favorite album but love all bad company
s86gam,"Bad Company is the music high school weight lifting coaches blast at 6 in the morning.  Nothing like 60 dudes scream singing ""Feel Like Making Love!"" to get you all pumped up."
s86gam,"Bad Co's problem is that their first record is their best, the next is their second best and so it goes on a downward slope. They rotted before our ears.  First one IS a classic, though"
s86gam,"It still kicks ass, and sounds like no other band.  They  never made a better album than their first."
s86gam,"I love that album from start to Seagull! When I was converting my old vinyl to digital this album was where I realized noise reduction was a crime. On my IPod classic you hear the needle hit the vinyl and that defect (in my copy) that pops about 5 times in the beginning of the song, just like it did in high school."
s86gam,"Not on their first album; but, ""Silver, Blue & Gold"" is the biggest underrated rock song."
s86gam,I heard a podcast about the OKC bombing and how Timothy McVeigh loved Bad Company and now I‚Äôll never not associate those two.
s86gam,First act to headline a stadium tour off their debut album
s86gam,Something something Jojo reference
s86gam,"When Paul Rodgers joined Queen I was like ""what?  No.  He's no Freddie!""

Then I watched a recording of the live show, and was like ""oh...I get it.""

[The Show Must Go On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfvMRREeD0)

No, he's not Freddie, and that's the thing.  He's a fucking rock star in his own right, and they were so right to tap him for the gig.  Rodgers didn't try to fill Freddie's shoes.  he brought his own pair."
s86gam,It really is I love it
s86gam,"The song Bad Company was featured on an episode of Billions, that's how i discovered them, the entire album is great, this and Thin Lizzy's Jailbreak are my go-to classic rock at the moment."
s86gam,They have a ton of bangers
s86gam,"Did anyone else discover ""Bad Company"" the song through Supernatural? It's one of my favorite songs now."
s86gam,One of the best albums ever
s86gam,I loved Bad Company...they were a second or third up band. J. Geils's band was similarly placed. Bad Company tipped into being played disco nights. Don't worry so was the Rolling Stones. They had a dance beat in their repertoire running into & past mid-70s.
s86gam,"Agreed. 

Also, ""Feel Like Making Love"" off Straight Shooter is like, ridiculous. Chunk-chunk--BAM! chunk-chunk--BAM! Holy hell, that guitar is a force of nature."
s86gam,"Terry Reid is another guy, like Paul Roger‚Äôs, that‚Äôs underrated and can sing his ass off! Zeppelin‚Äôs 1st choice, they went with Plant when he declined, I hear."
s86gam,"I just recently bought straight shooter in great condition for 1$ at a vinyl store. Quintessential dad rock, sounded fantastic!"
s86gam,Paul Rogers is my favorite singer of all time! Their live at Red Rocks show is amazing!
s86gam,"Bad Company, Grand Funk, and BTO, 8-track cartridges were always close at hand in high school while cruising the strip. Still gets my old bones moving 40 some-odd years later."
s86gam,"Eric Johnson


Damn Yankees


BAD COMPANY



Steve Miller Band


Alpine Valley, East Troy WI


Helluva show! Can't remember the year though..."
s86gam,"Great timing coincidence. I just finished sorting and cleaning the last box of vinyl albums from my Dad's collection. Bad Company was among them, and I'm not currently familiar. I guess the universe is telling me to give this one a listen next. Thanks for the recommendation!"
s86gam,Dude. [Bad Company - Ready For Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rClS2ANayh8&t=481s)
s86gam,It is. But 10 From 6....oof.
s86gam,"Bad Company is an interesting band. They started with two awesome albums, I love ‚ÄúBad Company‚Äù and ‚ÄúStraight Shooter‚Äù. ‚ÄúRun with the Pack‚Äù is solid but a step down. ‚ÄúBurnin Sky‚Äù and ‚ÄúDesolation Angels‚Äù are a mixed bag.

But the 80s were not kind. ‚ÄúRough Diamonds‚Äù is what I would consider the last real Bad Company and it‚Äôs not good. 

The band completely changed its sound after that album. ‚ÄúFame and Fortune‚Äù and ‚ÄúDangerous Ace‚Äù have some decent tunes but they sound like a wannabe Foreigner cover band. All 4 albums with Brian Howe (RIP) singing are dubious at best.

And I have never listened to their final 2 studio albums so I can‚Äôt comment. I tell people that are interested to just stick with the first 3 albums unless they really want to do some deep diving."
s86gam,"""Seagull"" is still the unheralded gem on the album."
s86gam,I remember high school ...
s86gam,I prefer Bad Company (UK)
s86gam,"Not my cup of cock rock. They always seemed like some knobs posing as badasses, making boring predictable music for the muscle-car crowd.  Like maybe they positioned themselves as safely straight rockers at a time when 70s glam had girly boys in heels & make-up in the spotlight? I remember at least a couple of kids who liked Bad Co. in the 80s really really wanted other kids to know that they weren't gay at all.


[""Feel Like Makin' Love""](https://youtu.be/TeZqjZ_kvLY) from the 2nd album sounds like a literal comedy parody to me. Like something Trey Parker would have written for Team America or Orgasmo."
s86gam,Bad Co sucks.
s86gam,"Check out J. Geils band if into Bad Company. 

This would be a typical concert night: 
Tickets were really expensive 18$ to 35$ 
J. Geils Band 
Bad Company
Humble Pie
Yes
Ten Years After

Black Sabbath played with one local talent."
s86gam,"Alison Krauss said Paul Rodgers‚Äô voice is ‚Äú incredibly masculine, sexy and hard working.‚Äù  Well said. It is still strong and pure.  He takes care of his voice."
s86gam,"Also Bad Brains, Bad Brains (1982). Just came to my head..."
s86gam,"Bad Company - Here Comes Trouble, is a great album. Different era, different singer, but holy hell, what a good record"
s86gam,"10 from 6 is none of those albums I inherited from my parents collection and has always been one of my go to picks, it wasn't till many years later that I realised it was a compilation even though looking at it now it's blatantly obvious."
s86gam,Self titled album with a self-titled track. That's balls.
s86gam,"I have their album 6 from 6 in my van. 6 belters in a row.

I do now prefer the FFDP version of Bad Company (The song) as it hits a bit harder"
s86gam,"Such a great band and I agree with you. I recently picked up a copy of their album ""Desolation Angels"" on vinyl. Huge flea-market find here in Tampa for $8.00 

What a fantastic album..."
s86gam,I love that album start to finish! Not a crap song to be found.
s86gam,Drove from Philadelphia to Knoxville for the worlds fair in 1982. We had ONE 8 track for the player- Bad Company.
s86gam,Saw them live when I was in high school in the early 80s.  Awesome.
s86gam,Simon Kirke is a bad ass drummer.
s86gam,"I prefer [Bad Company - The Nine](https://youtu.be/KIGXGkzjAoc). 

Changed dnb forever when it dropped."
s86gam,I used to love it but over the years it has worn thin. 2 chord songs get old.
s86gam,Also one of the more overlooked call of dutys
s86gam,"Paul Rodgers' solo version of the song is way better in my opinion.

https://youtu.be/SBsUub--P0E"
s86gam,Facts
s86gam,"Check out their song ""Nuthin on the TV"" or my favorite ""Electricland"" timeless lyrics that apply to today"
s86gam,I'm pretty sure the only song I have ever heard from Bad Company is the song Bad Company. Not sure what album it's on.
s86gam,Seagull
s86gam,Who has a song with the same name as the band?
s86gam,It was such a good album that I went to see them on their tour for it. They were one of the worst live bands I've ever seen.
s86gam,"I remember the day my older brother (boomer) bought Bad Co when it was released, and hearing the album, and I knew the hits were going to be big hits, but the title track was different and smouldering on the piano. Much better than the rest. And then the other albums came out with nothing good, and I moved on to better things, and cringed at every note when it popped on the heavy rotation when they got worse and worse and worse, just like Foreigner. Foreigners first album was pretty amazing the day it was released, but now?"
s86gam,When I was a young lad in the early 90's I happened to order some of those CDs for a penny.  I picked based purely on the album cover and Bad Company - Bad Company was one of the lucky 16.
s86gam,*I can't deny it.*
s86gam,And you know what the best song on the album Bad Company by Bad Company is Bad Company
s86gam,"Timothy McVeigh's favourite band.

&#x200B;

*AlsodidyouknowAlcatrazmeansPelican?*"
s86gam,"I watched a great documentary on them. Can't remember if it was the 40th anniversary or not, but that's likely it.

Apparently there was a lot of trepidation about their this album because it was not only their first release but also the first on Zepplin's new swan song label. Bad Co was a supergroup so everyone, including Zep, was afraid these guys would get a big head because of the hype and tank. They proved everyone wrong for sure."
s86gam,Midwest 80s and 90s they were on classic rock radio constantly. But yeah good stuff if you haven't heard of them yet.
s86gam,"Saw them live a few years back. Incredible show, Paul Rodgers‚Äô voice has really aged well."
s86gam,"My pops told me he saw a band waaay back in the day, called Free. They were named that cause their music was free, their shows were free, and they were free. Or so that‚Äôs what he told me. He then said when they got a record deal they sold out, their sound changed, they started charging insane prices for their shows, and they changed their name‚Ä¶. To Bad Company.

Could be all untrue, but it‚Äôs a memory that will always pop up when Bad Company comes up."
s86gam,"I had the pleasure of seeing Paul Rodgers at a little music festival in Canada a few years ago. Wow, that voice... Hasn't changed much since he was 18 singing in ""Free""."
s86gam,They still sound great live also. Great band!
s86gam,Agree on Bad Company - For all you 80's metal heads there was Metal  Church - band - Metal Church song - Metal Church CD
s86gam,God that's such an overused term
s86gam,Hell yeah! Had my first gay sex to that album back in 76 with my brother of course. Brings back good times.
s86gam,"I concur! Another banger, their 'Live"" album"
s86gam,"Is there another band out there whose biggest hit is also the name of the band? Seriously, I can‚Äôt think of one."
s86gam,"If you're like me and happen to be both a Bad Company/classic rock and Shakespeare fan, check out ""Scotland, PA"" a modern take (as of late 90s) on Macbeth. Great movie and killer soundtrack."
s86gam,10 from 6 has entered the chat.
s86gam,Bad Company \^3
s86gam,Bad Company by the band Bad Company off the album Bad Company
s86gam,Classic rock sucks. It's 2022 get some new tastes
s86gam,Rip our friend Timmy McVeigh
s8gwoc,"> Doom Metal

Uh-oh"
s8gwoc,So stoked. Seeing them live next month
s8gwoc,"Decent enough, as a lead single for a new album it doesn't quite have the same punch as Rats did but still new Ghost is always a good thing."
s8gwoc,"Aight guys, I love Ghost, but it isn't doom metal. I'd like to throw out a term for where I think Ghost lands: Pop Metal. I honestly think that it's the most apt description of their sound."
s8gwoc,"Love the band, like the song...but is it really Doom Metal? Is it really?"
s8gwoc,"Sick, I'm always happy to hear new Ghost"
s8gwoc,This is not doom metal
s8gwoc,Has Papa changed his persona again?
s8gwoc,Getting some good The Black Album-vibes from this.
s8gwoc,"Great stuff! Ghost is a weird band for me. I like damn near every song I hear, but I never really get into them like I do with other bands. Idk why that is lol"
s8gwoc,Ghosts EP: Opus Eponymous is one of the 100 greatest metal albums EVER and I will stand by that til I die
s8gwoc,"This is the happiest sounding doom prog hard classic rock metal I've heard in a long time.

I love Ghost so much. I don't care what people say, *Kiss the Go-Goat* and *Mary On a Cross* are some of the best."
s8gwoc,this sounds more like Toto than metal
s8gwoc,"Ghost isn‚Äôt metal


Ghost DEFINITELY isn‚Äôt doom metal

Edit: guys I actually LIKE Ghost for what it‚Äôs worth"
s8gwoc,Uh oh you called it doom metal now just wait for the /r/metal elitists to tell you why you‚Äôre wrong
s8gwoc,"I Don't like anything I have heard by Ghost but this, this is amazing."
s8gwoc," Ghost is like a drug

&#x200B;

Once you hear it, you never leave it. This is addicting as FUCK. Love you guys SO FUCKING MUCH!"
s8gwoc,I love ghost
s8gwoc,"Every time I hear a song by this band I wait for the ""metal"" to happen."
s8gwoc,for real doom metal: [Sunn O))) - megszents√©gtelen√≠thetetlens√©gesked√©seitek√©rt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3b7oNYf22s)
s8gwoc,"i like ghost, but i think i'm going to stick with the earlier more rock'n stuff. they seem to be going in a direction that's more like... campy? more theatrical? it's a little too sing-songy for my taste. bring back the fucking riffs! ü§ò"
s8gwoc,"It's fine, but it feels like a spiritual sequel to Prequelle.  They should've called the album ""Sequelle"".  #LOL."
s8gwoc,This is late 80's Ozzy Osbourne hair metal ballad revival schlock disguised as modern metal.
s8gwoc,This music video is dorky as hell. Lol it's an alright tune though.
s8l7lk,The Beatles - either *Abbey Road* (the last they recorded) or *Let It Be* (the last they released) - both excellent.
s8l7lk,Sublime - self-titled album.
s8l7lk,Simon and Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Water. I‚Äôd also count LA Woman by The Doors as it was their last album with Jim Morrison.
s8l7lk,MTV Unplugged by Nirvana
s8l7lk,"I'm mostly into metal. A band putting out an amazing album really late in their career is pretty rare. But there is one exeption...

Death - The Sound of Perseverance

They have a flawless discography, but that album to me is one of the best in both Death Metal and Prog Metal genres."
s8l7lk,"Fugazi - The Argument

As much as I hope for another one but Portishead - Third

Elliott Smith - Figure 8 (From a Basement on a Hill if you take into account post-mortem albums)

Kyuss - ...And the Circus Leaves Town

Morphine - The Night

Talk Talk - Laughing Stock"
s8l7lk,A Tribe Called Quest
s8l7lk,"Blackstar by David Bowie

It's amazing and so moving. Almost as good as his Berlin trio."
s8l7lk,The Police - Synchronicity
s8l7lk,Temple Of The Dog
s8l7lk,Electric lady land for sure
s8l7lk,"Back to Black - Amy Winehouse 

Spiderland - Slint

Warehouse: Songs and Stories - Husker Du

Third/ Sister Lovers - Big Star

Loaded - The Velvet Underground"
s8l7lk,"Leonard Cohen's last album. Like I said when it came out, when Leonard *opens* with a cantor, you know it's about to get serious. And it was, serious, and beautiful and sad and painful and incredible. What a swan song. 

Same with Bowie. When artists of that caliber know they've got limited time, magic can happen, but oh, it hurts."
s8l7lk,"*Pink Moon* by Nick Drake

Wish I could say *Gaucho* by Steely Dan, but they went and reunited."
s8l7lk,"Ignoring long periods in between, and sticking with the original group: 

The Eagles - The Long Run

Alice In Chains - Tripod album/Unplugged"
s8l7lk,Thank You For Your Service‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. by A Tribe Called Quest.  Reunion album mostly completed before Phife Dogs death at age 45 from diabetes complications.  Just as good as anything in their early 90s prime.
s8l7lk,Abbey Road
s8l7lk,"Random Access Memories by Daft Punk. I not only think is the best Daft Punk's album, but one of the best albums ever made."
s8l7lk,"Circles by Mac Miller. 

It felt like both closure and a bittersweet goodbye. His last couple of albums showed so much growth as a musician and artist, it is still so upsetting that we will never get to hear all the amazing art he would have created had he still been here."
s8l7lk,"Doors- LA Woman.

Its bluesy, greasy, volatile and thanks to Riders on the Storm and the title track, an epic road trip album."
s8l7lk,David Bowie- Black Star
s8l7lk,Warren Zevon -The Wind
s8l7lk,Rush. Clockwork Angels.
s8l7lk,LA Woman
s8l7lk,Apparently the Every Time I Die album
s8l7lk,Closer - Joy Division
s8l7lk,Iggy and The Stooges - Raw Power. One of the best rock n roll albums ever made. I do not acknowledge the reunion records so yes Raw Power is the last Stooges record.
s8l7lk,[deleted]
s8l7lk,"Rage Against The Machine's Renegades album.

Yes, yes, it's all covers ‚Äî but damn that album gets me goin!"
s8l7lk,"Brand New - Science Fiction 

It‚Äôs not their best album, well actually it might be, but it sort of sums up their whole varied discography in one final effort, very effectively"
s8l7lk,"The Postal Service - Give Up

Double dipping"
s8l7lk,LA Woman by The Doors was Jim Morrison‚Äôs last album (the band released 2 more after his death). Clockwork Angels by Rush was also a great way for the band to go out.
s8l7lk,Also *Pearl* by Janis Joplin (her last studio album) was great.
s8l7lk,Certainly not a best of all time but Every Time I Die just went out with a hell of an album
s8l7lk,"The Funeral Album - Sentenced

Final song ‚ÄúEnd of the Road‚Äù is amazing and videos from the tour supporting this album have the singer shouting ‚Äúsee you in hell‚Äù before exiting the stage while the epic final guitar solo plays.  

Truly a perfect way for a band to go out on their own terms."
s8l7lk,"Emperor. The final lyrics on the final track to the final emperor album are as follows,

""Of final wishes I ask none
But one
Now that I am gone
Lay thorns on my grave""


That's pretty epic."
s8l7lk,"The Dismemberment Plan‚Äôs Changes WOULD have been my answer here, had there not been that rather unfortunate coda a few years back‚Ä¶ If Changes had indeed been their swan song, it would easily be an all-time best last album."
s8l7lk,Led Zeppelin - In Through the Outdoor
s8l7lk,The Mars Volta- Noctourniquet was a strong final offering.
s8l7lk,The Sound of Perseverance. There is literally nothing more perfect than it.
s8l7lk,"Bad as Me, Tom Waits....*tears*

Unless?"
s8l7lk,"In an Aeroplane Over the Sea‚ÄîNeutral Milk Hotel

Who Will Cut Our Hair When We‚Äôre Gone‚ÄîThe Unicorns

Neither band was prolific, but these are two of my top 5 albums of all time and they never followed them up"
s8l7lk,"It‚Äôs not their best, but A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead is a pretty respectable album. 

Hopefully it won‚Äôt be their last though"
s8l7lk,"Synchronicity-The Police, Closer-Joy Division, Pink Moon-Nick Drake"
s8l7lk,"The United States Of America - United States Of America  
(the band made one album and split up) they had potential to be **HUGE** but it just didn't work out"
s8l7lk,"The Sky Is Crying - Stevie Ray Vaughn
Grievous Angel - Gram Parsons"
s8l7lk,"INNUENDO by Queen! How come no one mentioned this before? It was Freddie Mercury's masterpiece with the rest of the band while he was dying of AIDS. [He did the vocals for the last song in one amazing take after downing a shot of vodka](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1fy1ej/til_freddy_mercury_was_so_ill_with_aids_when_he/).

The whole album is pretty amazing."
s8l7lk,Warren Zevon - The Wind
s8l7lk,I‚Äôm sad that I can now comment ‚ÄúRadical‚Äù by Every  Time I Die for this thread :(
s8l7lk,Well since Everytime i Die just broke up(üíî) i guess Radicals is a pretty good choice.
s8l7lk,Mad Season - Above
s8l7lk,*The Sound of Perseverance* by Death. Absolutely incredible Prog/Tech-Death masterpiece by the progenitors of the genre.
s8l7lk,"Talk Talk - Laughing Stock

Isis - Wavering Radiant

Oceansize - Self Preserved While The Bodies Float Up

Death - The Sound of Perseverance"
s8l7lk,"For very different reasons...

1. The Angelic Process, *Weighing Souls With Sand*. Gorgeous album that became really sad in hindsight with the death of Kris Angylus.

2. After Forever, self-titled. Not like Nightwish-style symphonic metal was anything groundbreaking by then but After Forever put so much emotion, energy, and *fun* into their final album that their contemporaries didn't. I still sometimes wish they continued on instead of Floor eventually joining Nightwish and completing the circle.

Chosen because Death's *The Sound of Perseverance* was already spoken for."
s8l7lk,"Gonna go with more obscure ones.

*Dragonslayer* by Sunset Rubdown is a great final album.

*Donuts* by J Dilla."
s8l7lk,"Well from Club 27, Amy Winehouse's final album was her most famous. I dont actually like In Utero that much. I reviewed this for a student newspaper and I mentioned then it felt like an album on the cusp of suicide. Manic Street Preachers did a very similar album with Holy Bible. Of bands that split, At The Drive In split for some reason after a good album."
s8l7lk,"Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light - Woods of Ypres

Released posthumously after David Gold (vocalist, guitarist, songwriter, recorded drums) passed away. Brilliant last album from an almost flawless discography."
s8l7lk,"Unwound - Leaves Turn Inside You (honestly if u haven‚Äôt listened to them / this album u should get yo ass on it now. Highly underrated band. They started of as hardcore punk, gradually transitioning into a post hardcore/industrial/lo-if indie blend. Their songs are angry but not aggressive, delicate but not shy and emotional af but not soppy or cheesy or corny)"
s8l7lk,Public Image Ltd. Metal Box.
s8l7lk,Closer Joy division!
s8l7lk,"Bridge Over Troubled Water or Abbey Road, without a doubt. In Utero is pretty close though."
s8l7lk,"The Birthday Party - Junkyard

Perhaps the greatest rock'n'roll album of all time."
s8l7lk,Warren Zevon- The Wind.  With his dying breath he decided to make an album.  Poignant and beautiful. Heartbreaking.
s8l7lk,Painting of a Panic Attack by Frightened Rabbit.
s8l7lk,As Tall As Lions - You Can‚Äôt Take It With You. It was their best work. One of my all time favorites
s8l7lk,Van halen had the best first album and the worst last album lol
s8l7lk,Johnny Cash‚Äôs last few were great
s8l7lk,"Velvet Underground - Loaded.  

It's the real last Velvet Underground record because it wasn't Velvet Underground without Lou Reed."
s8l7lk,Goodbye Cream. I still personally think Badge is one of the greatest songs ever written.
s8l7lk,Roxy Music - Avalon
s8l7lk,Blind Melons Soup
s8l7lk,In Through The Outdoor -Led Zeppelin (CODA doesn‚Äôt count)
s8l7lk,"Uncle Tupelo - Anodyne

Band members made a bunch of great albums with other bands (Wilco, Son Volt), but some of the magic died with UT."
s8l7lk,The Jam - The Gift
s8l7lk,"""Bad Magic"" by Mot√∂rhead 

Last studio album of Mot√∂rhead with Lemmy passed 4 months after the album along with the disbanding of Mot√∂rhead. 

Album released 28th August 2015 
Lemmy passed 28th December 2015"
s8l7lk,"Frank Zappa- The Yellow Shark

I believe this was the final album of new material released under his name, while he was alive and with his participation, so I‚Äôm counting it.

Modernist ‚Äúclassical‚Äù style composition was always a key part of Zappa‚Äôs music and its influence was always a mixed bag. It was incorporated in his rock music but also sometimes he released orchestral albums which were mixed (boring, IMO).

For example he did a record with the London Symphony Orchestra but the compositions were inscrutable to most listeners and uninteresting to the musicians. He resorted to digital recordings and even won a Grammy for it but that tech sounds dated and cold.

The Yellow Shark is a live recording of a modernist classical chamber group performing a variety of Zappa‚Äôs songs and compositions, rearranged to match their enthusiasm for the material and conducted by Zappa himself. It‚Äôs an appropriately fitting final album, musically more interesting and energetic than anything he worked on for like 15 yrs before that (IMO), and relatively accessible even for listeners who don‚Äôt care about modern chamber music (ie, most people).

Plus because it‚Äôs instrumental you don‚Äôt have to slog through insults about working women or raps about Jesse Jackson or whatever."
s8l7lk,Your majesty from The Anniversary
s8l7lk,"Not sure if many here are all that into punk, but these two are 100% their best work:

- A Global Threat - Where the Sun Never Sets

- Clit 45 - Self Hate Crimes

Both of these artists already stood out among other street punk bands in the '90s/early '00s, which was a subgenre that didn't offer much variety and easily became a parody of itself. These two albums however are both lyrically and musically fantastic examples of the potential for street punk if it wasn't watered down by a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy situation. Their early catalogs were pretty good and showed steady improvement, but these really can't be beat."
s8l7lk,Definitely a lot more recent and I know not everyone will agree but Danger Days was My Chemical Romance's best album. And that's saying a lot.
s8l7lk,"The last Genesis album with Peter Gabriel - The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway


Also the last Sublime album with Bradley Nowell, which is also truly the last album, though they carried on as Sublime with Rome."
s8l7lk,"Snake finger. He had 3 albums that were pretty much nonsense, and 1 decent blues album. But his last album is a masterpiece."
s8l7lk,System of a down - hypnotized
s8l7lk,I am in the minority of people who think Terror Twilight is Pavement‚Äôs best album
s8l7lk,"David Bowie's ""Blackstar"".  He recorded that one and ""The Next Day"" after he was diagnosed with liver cancer, and ""Blackstar"" was made once he knew he was terminal.   


Knowing he knew it was the last thing he'd ever do gave him a push to make the best record he could, and since it's Bowie, that's a lot.   


Also have to mention Warren Zevon's ""The Wind"" , which was recorded under similar circumstances."
s8l7lk,Mac Miller- circles (largely completed before his death but released after)
s8l7lk,"The Seahorses, Do it Yourself. 
Squirrel Bait,  Skag Heaven.
The Stone Roses, Second Coming."
s8l7lk,"Hopefully they'll get back together again, but Sound and Color by Alabama Shakes is a great last and sophomore album. The songs flow one into the next thematically, and at the end you can start again."
s8l7lk,Innuendo by Queen
s8l7lk,"Beulah - Yoko

It is much rockier than their previous albums, but the emotional core is still present. Beulah never made a bad album, but this one takes the cake and was their last chance at making the band work (commercially speaking). I'm sad that they didn't succeed in that endeavor, but the album is so great that I'm still listening to it almost 20 years after."
s8l7lk,"Silver Jews - Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea"
s8l7lk,"Division bell - Pink Floyd, I adore that album. But I guess the endless river would be the last project but I also love that album too"
s8l7lk,Dissociation by The Dillinger Escape Plan
s8l7lk,Thanks for the dance was a pretty strong finale for Leonard Cohen. I also liked you want it darker.
s8l7lk,"Frank Ocean, since at this point he‚Äôs probably never coming out with another"
s8l7lk,Blackstar by Bowie
s8l7lk,El Jardin de los Presentes - Invisible
s8l7lk,Frightened Rabbit
s8l7lk,Brand New's last album Science Fiction is their best record.
s8l7lk,"Painting of a Panic Attack - Frightened Rabbit  

Ghost Notes - Veruca Salt  

Dove - Belly  

Miss America - Mary Margaret O‚ÄôHara  

Twenty Something Winters - SitDown Tracy  

All of Your Friends are Dead - ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS"
s8l7lk,"I really enjoyed Brand New's final album, Science Fiction."
s8l7lk,"I'm biased because they're my favorite band and just recently imploded, but Radical by Every Time I Die might actually be their next album."
s8l7lk,L.A. Woman
s8l7lk,"Woods of Ypres‚Äô final album is my personal favorite of all five (four if you count their first album as an EP).

I‚Äôve heard Type O Negative‚Äôs final album more often than any of their others."
s8l7lk,*The Eternal* by Sonic Youth has good reviews though I've never listened to it.
s8l7lk,Pacific Ocean Blue by Dennis Wilson.
s8l7lk,"Very unpopular opinion, but The Cars - Door To Door is, imo, a fantastic album. In particular, Fine Line is amazing; exemplary of 80s psychedelia. I think there might be one track O could skip listening front to back, maybe. (Technically Move Like This was the final album, but it was more like a singular release because it was released almost 25 years after D2D and after the band essentially called it quits)."
s8l7lk,"Infrasoinuak by Berri Txarrak. Pretty decent big band in Navarre (Spain) that sings in an old language.

Its the last album they recored before splitting after 25 years, right when they were on the top of the career but they didnt want to continue as many popular bands release crap and people still buy stuff, they didnt want to become that.

Its an awesome album, among their best."
s8l7lk,Trompe le Monde - Pixies. At the time ü§£
s8l7lk,"Those Once Loyal by Bolt Thrower.  Not universally, but widely considered their best album.  The band themselves considered it to be the ultimate statement of their style, done as perfectly as they feel it can ever be done, and just stopped recording afterwards because they didn't think it could ever be topped.  They continued to tour for over a decade until their drummer died, then called it quits."
s8l7lk,Dear You by Jawbreaker
s8l7lk,King Animal by Soundgarden
s8l7lk,The Funeral Album by Sentenced
s8l7lk,"Black Star - DB

Really was a last album :("
s8l7lk,Brand New - Science Fiction
s8l7lk,"Lots of good ones named already, so I'll throw my love behind The Blood Brothers Young Machetes. Arguably their best album too (though most days I prefer Crimes), & I'm not sure they could've topped it."
s8l7lk,J Dilla - Donuts
s8l7lk,Swimming / Circles by Mac Miller
s8l7lk,Mr. Bungle - California. I honestly listen to that one more than the other two combined.
s8l7lk,Daft Punk RAM
s8l7lk,Clockwork Angels slaps
s8l7lk,"Michael Jackson‚Äôs Invincible deserves a mention. Criminally underrated album with some of his best work on it. Break of Dawn, Butterflies, Unbreakable, Whatever Happens, You Rock My World, Speechless are all top tier MJ tracks. 

No it didn‚Äôt reach the heights of his ‚ÄòBig Four‚Äô but by most other artists standards it would probably be their best record."
s8l7lk,"The Beatles - Abbey Road (technically their last album recorded together)

Sec Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks

Jellyfish - Spilt Milk (absolutely *genius* album)

David Bowie - Blackstar"
s8l7lk,"Radical - Every Time I Die

Went with the recent nom but it doesn't change the fact that record is a god damn masterpiece."
s8l7lk,In Utero
s8l7lk,"Pixies - Trompe Le Monde, really underrated and overhated. Definely better than Bossanova, and still really original. A great album if you consider the fact that Deal and Frank really really hated each other back then‚Ä¶."
s8l7lk,Dr. Dre    Chronic 2001
s8l7lk,"Honestly I‚Äôd have to go with The Beatles‚Äô Abbey Road. I love the sound direction and every song is beautiful to me, I believe it to be their best album."
s8l7lk,"Studio:  The Division Bell

Live:  P.U.L S.E.

Hard ti say that they were Pink Floyd's greatest albums, but they were great ""last"" albums."
s8l7lk,"Every Time I Die - Radical. If you know, you know üíî‚òπ"
s8l7lk,"I definitely agree with the point about Nirvana and Sublime. Joy Division had the same experience with Closer, and I often wonder what might've been if Ian Curtis hadn't died that day

Blackstar is also a fantastic swan song for David Bowie. He knew his time was running out and he decided to make an album that pretty much raised a V sign to the concept of dying

Synchronicity is probably my favourite finale album, The Police generally had a very unique sound by that point and adding more of a foreign influence makes it a very strange album to listen to, compared to Outlandos or Regatta at least. Just goes to show how they'd evolved creatively in such a short time"
s8l7lk,"Black star - david bowie

What can i say, solid emotional tracks."
s8l7lk,"David Bowies last album was breathtaking 
Of course his death played a part in giving this album this haunting feeling but even without acknowledging his passing it‚Äòs still a phenomenal Album"
s8h8bn, Best death scream I‚Äôve heard in a while. And damn Brodie is still sexy as hell. Good song overall.
s8h8bn,"Live at Reading version is unbelievable. 
https://youtu.be/5IJ3k7CaqGA"
s8h8bn,"I recommend the live version at the Reading Festival.

https://youtu.be/5IJ3k7CaqGA"
s8h8bn,First heard this song live and listened to it for like a month straight after
s8h8bn,so in love with her omg
s8h8bn,There‚Äôs a chapter about The Distillers in the book Sellout by Dan Ozzi. Good read.
s8h8bn,"This song brings me back. Saw them play live in Ottawa touring on this record. At 3:15 the bass player stage dove off the speakers from maybe  8 feet up and the headstock broke my buddies nose and gave him the craziest black eye. Blood EVERYWHERE.  


We got to meet the band after. Got some free swag. They were all super cool. I miss live shows."
s8h8bn,I miss this band SO much. Spinnerette was not nearly as good IMO.
s8h8bn,the distillers drummer is hella sexy
s8h8bn,This brings me back to middle school damn
s8h8bn,Idk...all I'm hearing is Nirvana.
s8lat7,"Great job, love this song"
s8lat7,"Damn, that's really good dude!!"
s8lat7,Excellent cover!
s8lat7,Fun way to start my morning! Great cover
s8lat7,"Wow, great cover!  Would like to see a cover of Love Vigilantes and Leave Me Alone."
s8lat7,Fucking excellent cover!  Love it.
s8lat7,"Never heard this song before, so technically this is the best version of it I've ever heard.

But seriously good work OP, this made me stop my scrolling to listen all the way through."
s8lat7,this sucks
s8q708,I just don't get how they are planning on like 60 bands in 12 hours.
s8q708,Thanks for the research! This puts me more at ease.
s8q708,"I dunno about others but my concern isn't if the company is reputable, it's that there are too many bands, not enough stages, and too short of an event to sit well with me. It's literally too much crammed into a tiny, expensive schedule."
s7q4ru,"""Well you ain't Fiona Apple; and if you ain't Fiona Apple I don't give a rats ass."""
s7q4ru,As a boy who was just entering puberty when this video came out it made me feel some kind of way for sure.
s7q4ru,"This song and the its album were great. Last year, nearly 25 years later, Fiona‚Äôs new album was amazing. It‚Äôs not any kind of hidden gem, I know. It received lots of (deserved) praise. But if you haven‚Äôt taken the opportunity to check out Fetch the Boltcutters- I thought it lived up to the hype and it sonically defined a portion of the pandemic for me last year."
s7q4ru,I saw her in Portland at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall back in 98(?) and she DIDN'T USE A MICROPHONE! Just her and her piano filling the hall. It was absolutely jaw-dropping.
s7q4ru,"""He said it's all in your head, I said so is everything, but he didn't get it"" from Paper Bag is one of my favourite lyric snippets of all time."
s7q4ru,"I've always loved Fiona's work. And this song got a lot of airplay back in the day but yet it still sounds fresh to me. 

Part of that is the absolute beast of a drummer on this track, Matt Chamberlain. He's probably the best working drummer in popular music these days. If you like his style check out his old band Critters Buggin for some awesome freakout jazz(ish) sounds with Skerik, Brad Hauser (of the New Bohemians), and Mike Dillon. That band changed my life."
s7q4ru,I like 'Shadowboxer' better myself
s7q4ru,"I would suggest anyone interested in this song, Fiona herself, or 90's music in general take a listen to 60 Songs That Explain the 90s podcast on spotify. They did an excellent episode on this song as well as tons of great songs from the 90s. They did episodes on songs I wasn't even a fan of in the 90's that kept me glued to my headphones. I can't recommend that series enough. 

https://www.theringer.com/2021/12/15/22837378/fiona-apple-criminal-podcast-history"
s7q4ru,"I remember when this video came out everyone thought Fiona Apple was this hyper sexual anorexic raunchy woman but in reality she was just a classically trained teenager who was dealing with ptsd, an eating disorder and depression, they really put her in this box off one video 

Fiona Apple later made one of my fav videos as a teen and it still holds up, it was for ‚ÄúPaper Bag‚Äù and was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who she was dating, it‚Äôs a good song and she looks like she‚Äôs having fun skipping around dancing with those kids"
s7q4ru,I always think about the fact that she was 19 when she released Tidal. Imagine how much bullshit she went through to write THAT album at THAT age and younger. Truly one of my favorite artists ever. She has 0 bad songs.
s7q4ru,"My first big date with my college girlfriend was a Fiona concert in LA. 

A homeless guy came up to her and started physically harassing her, and myself and other guys in line grabbed him and got the cops. 

Was all worked up when they started letting people in, and we were up pretty close. Started smelling weed pretty strongly, and Fiona came out with a pipe she left by her piano and then spent the next 90 minutes making me a fan. 

Such an eventful day, but I gained so much respect for her live performance talent! See her if you haven't yet!"
s7q4ru,Fast As You Can has coke vibes but damn that song slaps
s7q4ru,"Imagine creating a phenomenal, no skip album at 19 years old‚Ä¶. Queen"
s7q4ru,[deleted]
s7q4ru,"Most 90s music sounds outdated. Like if you turned on the radio, you‚Äôd know it wasn‚Äôt modern. This song could have been put out last week and it would still make sense."
s7q4ru,Seeing her name always makes me think of [this](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/8c567d98-4761-4b5a-9d4c-12d24e6a1f27)
s7q4ru,"And can we talk about the raw fucking talent, please. She was (is) phenomenal and this album came out when she was like 18/19 years old."
s7q4ru,I still love this song. She is such a unique talent. The song ‚Äúsleep to dream‚Äù is also one of my favorites.
s7q4ru,Great song. It's on my Stabbing Westward playlist.
s7q4ru,I remember Carson Daily was really into her. Of all things why do I remember that?
s7q4ru,'You can use my skin to bury secrets in'
s7q4ru,"Kim Deal, Beth Gibbons, Lisa Loeb, Dolores O'Riordan, Poe, Fiona Apple, Alicia Keys ... I will forever have a crush on."
s7q4ru,It you have never seen the video for ‚ÄúNot about love‚Äù Do yourself a favor and watch it right now.
s7q4ru,"embarrassing admission time: back when this played on the radio every 5 seconds and I didn't know the song title, my dumb little teenaged brain heard the chorus as, ""Im feeling like a cribbon, uhwoah."" It wasn't until YEARS later where I saw the song title as criminal and was like, wait a minute wtf even IS a cribbon? Yeah, I was dumb."
s7q4ru,"Fiona Apple‚Äôs music has saved my life over and over again throughout the years. I remember buying ‚ÄúTidal‚Äù when I was in middle school and it was just utterly transformative for me. She gave voice to so much of what I was going through. I remember when I saw her play live the first time. She hit one chord and I just burst into tears. Later on in the show, she was thrashing around on the floor and belting it out like the most badass angelic lunatic I‚Äôve ever seen. 

I fucking love Fiona Apple so much."
s7q4ru,"I was such a sheltered baby at 18. It‚Äôs so crazy to see a girl singing about such heavy and mature topics. I can‚Äôt put myself in her shoes, I can‚Äôt imagine what it must have been like to deal with the burdens that were put upon her, OR to be able to write such nuanced and subversive material at such a young age."
s7q4ru,2 comments on this post and I already can't with you people
s7q4ru,"Tidal is such a great album.  I worked at Best Buy when the ""Sleep to Dream"" video first hit,  I worked in ""Video"" (name of the TV/VCR/DVD section), and that video played on a loop.  Of all the videos that ever played on that service, that one never got old.  Became a fan because of it."
s7q4ru,"I remember seeing this as a teenager. It was so incredibly different from anything else on MTV/VH1.  It has a dark grittiness to it and brought flash photos to life.  It also reshaped at my concept of what was sexy as I was more used to bright poppy stars being sexy.

As a car guy, the purple Plymouth product placement was strange but captivating too. 

Why was there a brand new car in this totally shady, 70's room? 

Great video, great artist, great song!"
s7q4ru,"I always thought Fiona was beautiful. 

I believe this one and Paula Abdul‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpposites Attract‚Äù were two videos my ex really liked."
s7q4ru,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
s7q4ru,always loved this music video
s7q4ru,god‚Ä¶ i haven‚Äôt heard this in forever.
s7q4ru,I love this song!  üñ§
s7q4ru,"""What would an angel say?  
The devil wants to know."""
s7q4ru,"I saw her in a small theatre in Birmingham, AL. I liked some of her songs before, but really became a fan that night. She doesn't interact too much, but DAMN, she's talented!"
s7q4ru,"So, I‚Äôm very very very late to the Fiona Apple party but I recently just got into her music. I‚Äôve tried for a bit before but it never really clicked until last year, I ended up DEVOURING her discography and fell in love with it. I absolutely love this song"
s7q4ru,"Whenever people ask stuff like ""what's your favorite full album"" I always include Tidal. Start to finish, just excellent. I personally wasn't as big into her subsequent albums, but I re-listen to Tidal often."
s7q4ru,"I've got to make a play to make my lover stay 
So what would an angel say, the devil wants to know.

I've always loved that line. Shit"
s7q4ru,Fiona Apple and Natalie Imbruglia really kicked puberty into high gear for me.
s7q4ru,who leaked this Euphoria season 3 trailer?
s7q4ru,"I've been a fan of her music since the first album, what an absolute treasure she is. Her later music definitely didn't/doesn't get the credit it deserves. She still writes great songs! The collaboration with Andrew Bird a few years ago was lovely too."
s7q4ru,"This video kind of gives me the creeps, in the best, horrible way possible, but I love this song. This introduced me to Fiona Apple and the rest of her work has made me a fan."
s7q4ru,This takes me back to 1997 getting ready to go to college. Think of that every time I hear this.
s7q4ru,It may be just me but this isn‚Äôt even the best song on that album imo
s7q4ru,"I‚Äôm always surprised when a new artist, as she was at the time, can make such a sexually seductive video in front of cameras and directors and other production crew. I feel like you need experience to warm up to being able to do that."
s7q4ru,"I'm just a brave traveler, who's finally come home"
s7q4ru,criminal criminal criminal
s7q4ru,good ol' fiona apple. gotta love her.
s7q4ru,"I think the song did it for me. I thought ahe was pretty. But the minute she came out she was very much not my type to turn me on. Way too skinny.

But the paper bag video. That one does it for me."
s7q4ru,FYT
s7q4ru,"I always took a lot of shit for liking this song. But really, what‚Äôs not to like? I think everybody either likes this song or ashamed of themselves for some weird religious reason."
s7q4ru,"Always loved her music. There's a lot of incidentals in her arrangement, giving the song a ""western"" flair and making it moody."
s7q4ru,"As a young boy, this video awakened something in me."
s7q4ru,"Fiona is amazing. Not body shaming her, but I am glad the super skinny emaciated look is no longer in vogue."
s7q4ru,The video is super meta in a song about using men and feeling guilty about it you're watching a 17-18yeat old writhe around barely clothed and being drawn in and feeling guilty about it.
s7q4ru,This was the jam back in the 90's.
s7q4ru,"Fiona Apple is a badass, all of her stuff is good"
s7q4ru,Heroin chic in its heyday
s7q4ru,I was 10 when this came out and was never the same afterward.
s7q4ru,WHAT I NEED IS A GOOD GOOD  LOVE
s7q4ru,"What a coinkidink! Got into a bit of a Fiona Apple bender as of late starting with When the Pawn‚Ä¶

Fantastic artist"
s7q4ru,[I still think her inclusion for the Microsoft Studio announcement was phenomenal!!](https://youtu.be/FEZ1-XbwZeI)
s7q4ru,She is so damn sexy
s7q4ru,"Way back in 1996 I was interning at a German press agency, and we got invited to watch the Paris showcase at La Cigalle. Beautiful show. The next morning we had the opportunity to interview her, and the boss allowed me to do it. I to this day don‚Äôt know how I got through the interview without embarrassing myself, I was so mesmerized by her beauty. So mesmerized in fact that I forgot to turn the tape recorder on‚Ä¶"
s7q4ru,I recall reading or hearing an interview with her somewhere in which she expressed unhappiness with this video and the 70s child porn vibe it has.
s7q4ru,"Ah yes, the video that made me realize I was bi"
s7q4ru,Sexiest music video ever made full stop.
s7q4ru,Her sexiness is criminally underrated.
s7q4ru,First music video I jerked off to. Thanks Fiona.
s7q4ru,She was like 16 in this....
s7q4ru,One of the greatest music videos of all time.
s7q4ru,"I listen to this album when I'm happy, I listen to this album when I'm sad. Definitely one that made an impression on me as a teen. Still love it so much."
s7q4ru,This video hit the same time as  puberty.  I discovered a lot about myself that year.
s7q4ru,Is she related to Tim Apple?
s7q4ru,"""Criminal"" is the first song I downloaded as an mp3, back when it was all mIRC and dodgy geocities-links. I own every single one of her albums too of course."
s7q4ru,my first time with this song was during American horror story watching. Awesome.
s7q4ru,"I‚Äôve got a cd that has an acoustic, jazzy, in-studio version of this song that she did for a DC radio station when this song was popular. It‚Äôs a fantastic version."
s7q4ru,"I had that CD with the image of her with an apple on the cover, I was so young. Wonder what she's doing now. I  was seeing her for about 2 weeks or so and then my dad took my binoculars away."
s7q4ru,"Honestly, always have been a huge fan, since her first album, which came out when I was 16. Fiona made me want to write music. I did and still am, partly because of her. Her lyrics are still some of the best I have ever heard. And it‚Äôs not just in Criminal, but every song. She‚Äôs an incredible songwriter, I actually think this video doesn‚Äôt do the song justice. For me, it distracts from how amazing the song really is, and doesn‚Äôt really reflect her personality. So much so that she wore a flesh colored bodysuit for the whole video."
s7q4ru,One of my favorite music videos of all time. It definitely kick-started my adolescence
s7q4ru,"She clearly has a foot fetish. Good for her, so do I."
s7q4ru,"I always knew I liked shiny stuff, but when she was standing there in those satin panties? That left no doubt about what I liked."
s7q4ru,This was a pretty racy video when it come out. Seems so innocent now.
s7q4ru,"The director of this video has done some cool shit, including directing the video for NIN's Closer, Jay Z's 99 Problems, Taylor Swift's Shake it Off, and the movie One Hour Photo. Cool guy!"
s7q4ru,I decided to watch this yesterday completely out of the blue. Creepy.
s7q4ru,This song is still incredible after all these years. Video is harrowing.
s7q4ru,"Classic, hot heroin chic"
s7q4ru,The Tune Dig Podcast does an excellent deep dive on Tidal and covers this video and the media reaction.
s7q4ru,She is attractive
s7q4ru,Something about the way this music video is shot is kinda creepy‚Ä¶
s7q4ru,"This song wasn't some sexual awakening for me. For me, the chorus stuck out. Super catchy then and now whenever i do feel like a criminal, because i consider a charotic neutral person,  i hum it."
s7q4ru,One of my top 50 songs that keeps spinning in my head.  Lots of personal tie-ins for me.  Loved it since it came out.
s7q4ru,"Hearing this song reminds me of the first time I heard it, and how it made me think of my relationship with my then girlfriend/future ex-wife.  The fact that at that time in 1996 this song made me think of my relationship should have been a red flag for me.

&#x200B;

And Pearl Jam's ""Better Man"""
s7q4ru,Fucking love her! Amazing music! Her newest album was amazing as well. Serious talent.
s7q4ru,"I was so young the first time I saw this video that remembering how it ""affected"" me makes me feel like a criminal."
s7q4ru,Fernando Vera theme
s7q4ru,What the heck? I never heard of this song but somehow it seems i liked the video. I'm utterly confused like WTF is GOING ON!!!
s7q4ru,0x27AA0f0E05d740A1Da818D2CEecDcA5f5cBAD93B

s7q4ru,Sucks
s7q4ru,"Unfaithful narcissist girls anthem. Regardless of the deep message some of you are pushing, that's the only kinds of girls I've ever known who jammed out to this lol. They cheat, play this song, feel redeemed and also feel like a rock star. Repeat"
s7q4ru,Kanye better
s7q4ru,Wow this is terrible music
s7q4ru,"I saw her open for a bigger band (I want to say Tears For Fears when it was just Roland on the Raul and the Kings Of Spain tour) in a small theater.  She already had the angel wings and some TV show had one of her songs in it.

She went over well for being someone that most people had never heard of.  I saw some bands get boo'ed off the stage at that place and one time there were only 30 people in the entire place to see the FIXX in 1998.  We could sit in the front row, then walk up to the stage to see the setlist to see what was coming and touch the shoes of the singer and then go sit back down.  

Then she put out that album with like a 30 word title and that sort of sank her career."
s7q4ru,"Her telling off the industry was nothing short of STELLAR.
(lol I'm currently adding this song to my cover set and its even sexy AF coming from a 54 yr old man :-*)"
s7q4ru,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkFwBcbnZKy0nLVefIFgvnQ
s7q4ru,Is this what it looks like when an addict is going through withdrawal?
s7q4ru,This damn song was playing hourly on every pop station from 1997 to 2005. SO overplayed. I still can't listen to it.
s7q4ru,About 15-17 years ago I called my local rock radio station for having this on the rotation.  They apologized and  said they would remove it.  I honestly never heard it played again.
s8n5nc,"Have you heard - Follow You, Follow Me - by Genesis?  If not, you'll have a new favorite."
s8n5nc,"I am a huge fan of the earlier Genesis catalog and highly recommend giving it a listen.  However, just so you know, Peter Gabriel was the lead singer on practically all of that material.  In fact, after he left the band, Genesis auditioned hundreds of singers before landing back on Phil. To quote Grateful Dead fans, ""Let Phil sing!"".  It worked out ok. üòÄ"
s8n5nc,"Even though I wasn't a fan of Genesis in the 80's, I did get a chance to see Collins on tour solo in 82 (i think) He did put on an incredible show and it was in a smallish theater setting rather than a big arena.  Good time!


Edit: made me look.  The theater only seats 3,500. That's the way to see a concert."
s8n5nc,I love this post. I love when people discover things for the first time. Also check out the Tarzan soundtrack he did for Disney!
s8n5nc,I‚Äôm a Phil Genesis stan; have all the albums from Duke-Invisible Touch. I also have Phil‚Äôs first three solo records. He also killed it on the Tarzan soundtrack.
s8n5nc,It reminds me of my childhood. Great song.
s8n5nc,"I had my ""invisible touch"" period, my Gabriel moment, my Duke and Abacab moment.

Now it's my ""any genesis is great genesis"" moment.. but if I have to choose two songs it would be The Musical box and Behind the Lines."
s8n5nc,"Saw the boys last month at Madison Square and even tho Phil had some issues he can still belt them out. An incredible showman.

&#x200B;

Also - it's definitely worth seeking out a Steve Hackett gig, he tours a lot and puts on a great show."
s8n5nc,"You should try playing it at .75x speed on YouTube. 

The original is amazing, but something about the slowed version that matches the vibe of the song a little better for me."
s8n5nc,Huge fan of genesis and Phil Collins love most of their music Everyday would have to be my favourite Phil track .. but I think it's post genesis
s8kfnq,I always come back to this song when I'm feeling really low. It's so somber yet soothing üñ§
s8kfnq,"From the looks of the title, you might need to go on my Subreddit and learn how to be more human r/musicbranding for the serious musicians. It discusses how humans behave to gain trust in your branding of being humanly human. The song gave me chills in the beginning, and you are totally human. You don't scare me, tho... as time went on in the song, I felt as if maybe I wasn't the human, and I was only acting humanly, perhaps too humanly. Song is a sold 8. It was awesome."
s88n8r,"Don‚Äôt you wanna go down, like some disgraced Cosmonaut?"
s88n8r,"One of my favorite bands ever. I was just listening to From Berkeley to Bakersfield the other day. Yes, I was the one."
s88n8r,Take me down to the infirmary‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
s88n8r,I really enjoyed that entire album.
s88n8r,"Camper Van Beethoven was the original band and they were so respectable Mr Fucking Bungle covered a medley of their tunes in high school.

Let me repeat

Once upon a time Mike Patton covered a medley of Camper Van Beethoven with Mr Bungle for a school talent show...Camper would later form Cracker lol

https://youtu.be/3kBL2Ctb4a4"
s88n8r,later on Jools Holland \* yeah I know typo in title
s88n8r,one of the greatest songwriters
s88n8r,"What the world needs now, is another folk singer, like I need a hole in the head...."
s88n8r,"Man, now there's a song I haven't heard for a long, long time."
s88n8r,"Man, this song brings back memories of teenage angst like no other!"
s88n8r,"The background song to my first skydive video, special place in my heart... total classic!"
s88n8r,The 90s seemed to be great man...
s88n8r,Thoroughly enjoy Cracker and CVB. Never really understood David Lowery's position [against Net Neutrality](https://thetrichordist.com/2017/07/12/have-you-been-suckered-on-net-neutrality-debate-by-google-and-big-tech/).
s88n8r,"I prefer the [""official"" music video](https://youtu.be/gYdlqjiQPAc) since it has Sandra Bernhard in it"
s88n8r,"I loved their albums but when I went to a free Smashing Pumpkins concert, Cracker opened and their performance was so much better and memorable, while SP's was not"
s88n8r,I was always surprised with how much Tom petty sued people for using his chords he never sued Cracker for using his voice.
s88n8r,Before he became an uncle?
s88n8r,I can't be the only one here who always thought he was playing that lick with a slide...
s7till,"I used to get told that all the time to the point where I was embarrassed to listen to rock in public because ‚Äúthis is white people shit‚Äù but I eventually broke down and was like ‚Äúthis is what I like and and enjoy‚Äù and vowed to never judge people for there music taste. It‚Äôs a stupid thing to say imo saying that one genre of music shouldn‚Äôt be listened to because of who makes it is just strange and you‚Äôre limiting yourself a lot especially with rock.

There is hundreds of great rockstars that are poc Freddie included"
s7till,"Freddie Mercury was not even white, he was South Asian or ""brown"" lmaooooooooo"
s7till,"Um‚Ä¶ No. Funny shit is Freddie isn‚Äôt White.üíÄ Also the Live Aid was literally to raise funds to stop the Ethiopian and Sudan famine in Africa. Instead of using hungry African children to ‚Äúadvertise‚Äù to ppl they used musicians and used it as a more convenient and easier way to connect to young and older audiences to raise funds for the famine.

As a Black person I‚Äôm starting to think ppl especially ignorant ppl like your GF are just saying it cause it‚Äôs starting to become this whole trend of coming after White ppl as a whole. I love music regardless of the race of the person and if it hits my ear senses just right, it‚Äôs ONLY about the music. You need to enlighten her that Freddie isn‚Äôt White and literally one of the most impactful and significant musicians who really popularize the genre of rock (a BLACK genre)."
s7till,"Your girl should check out Prince in the 80's. 

I have a feeling that she doesn't have much perspective of how the culture was back then and is commenting based on modern perceptions. Just a hunch, though."
s7till,"Indian guy who likes Queen here.

Calling something ""<race> people shit"" has always struck me as a uniquely American thing.

As a hypothetical, how would your girlfriend react to someone saying "" that's some black people shit"" and ""I can see why you like that"" in reference to rap and R&B?"
s7till,"Either she gets triggered listening to music outside of her comfort zone, or she has some serious prejudice.
Neither of those things is on you."
s7till,"""you're half white so that's your culture"" sounds pretty racist imo"
s7till,Gatekeeping based on race or culture is still gatekeeping.
s7till,"Wtf is that?

I don't hear Marvin Gaye and go,  'That's some black guy shit!'

I fucking turn it up."
s7till,"You know who isn‚Äôt white? Freddie Fuckin‚Äô Mercury. He was born in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents. Boy did his folks have some trouble understanding that rock-n-roll thing he was getting into. 

That‚Äôs some white people shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

That‚Äôs just pop culture, folks. All are welcome. Don‚Äôt judge by race. It‚Äôs that simple."
s7till,"That's kind of racist, but I get your point; honestly, if you like music solely based on the person's skin color of the person something must be wrong with you."
s7till,"That‚Äôs not a debate, it‚Äôs a realisation that you‚Äôve got great taste in music and terrible taste in girlfriends. 

It‚Äôs truly tragic that people can be convinced of such a simple lie; that they should limit the music they can like to listen to because of the amount of pigment in their skin or the geographical location they live in."
s7till,"As a white person, no.  And I wouldn‚Äôt look at a rap or R&B performance and instantly dismiss it as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs some black people stuff.‚Äù  Sounds like she was either joking (?) or has some racial issues that she needs to think about."
s7till,Freddie was for everyone!
s7till,"Damn, that's racist. So rap is some black people shit then? Lol"
s7till,Sounds like your girl is racist
s7till,"Uh, Freddie wasn't white. His parents were Parsi-Indian."
s7till,Queen is white people shit? A rock band fronted by a gay Asian man playing at a humanitarian aid concert is not what cis/white normie conservatives were clamoring for in the mid-80's. Why don't you put on some David Allen Coe and then tell me that Queen is white people shit.
s7till,"Considering Freddie Mercury wasn‚Äôt white, I don‚Äôt quite get their point."
s7till,Sounds like media influenced racism. Most people don't say shit like that
s7till,"Black guy here who listens to Journey, Led Zeppelin, Eagles, John Mayer, Queen, Tom Petty...

I also have a guitar + vocal cover of some these artist's/bands songs on my YouTube...im a musician tho, but I've listened to like 30 genres. Rap/Hip Hop, Rock, Metal, Reggae, Blues, Country...talent is talent"
s7till,Your gf is both ignorant and has terrible taste in music.
s7till,That is some racist shit.
s7till,"He was born to Persian-Indian parents in Zanzibar. He attended Indian schools, followed by more time in Zanzibar until he was 18.

And is apparently ""white people shit.""

The ignorance and racism here is wild."
s7till,Your gf was being racist. Freddy wasn't even Caucasian.
s7till,My dad dismisses rap because he's racist. He dismisses Queen because Freddie was gay. Your girlfriend has a lot in common with my racist ass dad.
s7till,"People who really appreciate music, can enjoy music that is well done no matter the artist or the genre and Freddy Mercury was one of the greats. Don't let ANYBODY suck the joy out of your musical journey."
s7till,What the Hell does color have to do with this? It's music. You either like it or don't like it!
s7till,She sounds like an idiot
s7till,"While that comment is not uncommon, it's foolish. Tell her Black people invented rock & roll. Tell her to look into the history of that genre, of its connections to blues, etc. That comment comes from pure ignorance (it isn't racist, but it is prejudicial and fully ignorant). Tell her to educate herself so she doesn't say something so ridiculous again. It's 2022... whatever her race is, she should know better. If she's Black, she ought to know that Rock is even more ingrained in our culture than white culture. If anything, it's more American music than ""race music,"" which then spread around the planet to the point that there is no well-off country that doesn't have it (same for hip-hoo/rap). Her world view is limited and lacking. I hope you can help her expand it. And, if she doesn't want to grow up, I hope she doesn't hold you back. There is far too much music (and far too much history behind it) to limit ourselves to only listening to people who look a certain way."
s7till,"Dude she's just an ignorant puss!
I'm white and was 5 yrs old and fell in love with the sounds of fats domino...then there was an explosion in the sixty...Sam Cooke, Aretha, Ray Charles, Otis Redding...then came Hendrix.  The entire band Sly and the Family Stone are essentially unmatchable....as we rolled into the 70s and 80s, I took for granted that in rock it was white dominated. Guys like Paul Simon were going to Africa to grab and record with outstanding musicians of any colour and race. Now I'm old...if you're good, you're good...Freddie was good. Brian May is good as well as Roger Taylor. Each era has its gold and gold is not being white or black...it's just being good"
s7till,Freddie Mercury wasn‚Äôt white and he was radical af
s7till,"Freddie isn't even white, and his music is loved by all.

Queen topped the charts all over the world, for years.

They sold out South Africa and Japan, they were literally the biggest band in Brazil and Argentina, their music is known by billions."
s7till,Your girlfriend is an ignorant racist.
s7till,"Look mate your gf is an asshole, racist and most of all uncultured. Anyone who is able to appreciate art is able to look beyond the person who makes it. John lennon was a bad father,  eric clapton addicted to cocaine, van gogh was sick in the head and lovecraft was a racist yet none of those things prevent people from enjoying their work."
s7till,Break up with that.
s7till,This is some dumb shit. Stop worrying about black white whatever and try to enjoy life lol
s7till,"White guy here.  Good music has no color.  Love George Benson, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye."
s7till,"Freddy Mercury wasn't a white person, so there's that."
s7till,"Tell her Queens ""I want to Break Free"" was pretty big in South Africa during it's time as a fight against oppression. I think some South American countries as well. 

Music is music to me. I'm a middle age white dude that loves it's all. I still remember hearing Run DMC and Aerosmith for the first time and just stopping. 
I also grew up with Waylon and Willie Nelson at Grandmas, bad 80's hairbands on the radio and all though the 90's I heard a huge amount of different kinds of music and loved a bunch of it. 

Look up peter gabriel he's got some great shit you might like. It's not really Queen related I've just been listening to his stuff again."
s7till,"She has probably never heard of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and Jackie Wilson. There is also Jimmy Hendrix and a whole lot of black performers in the mold of Freddy Mercury. She needs music education."
s7till,This discussion or debate has 2% to do with Queen.
s7till,"""Another One Bites the Dust"" was, famously, featured heavily on black radio stations when it was released. Freddie and the boys are the real deal with musical influences spanning just about every genre. Your GF is delusional and needs to chill. A lot of anger. You keep on rocking to what you like."
s7till,"Does everything have to be about the color of skin?  Seriously.   Racism in America cant ever end.  It will never end.   For so many people, race is all they have."
s7till,"Having ""white"" and ""black"" music is sort of stupid i think, music should be for everyone."
s7till,"I assume your GF is black. It‚Äôs not an uncommon attitude to believe everything except rap/soul/R&B is ‚Äúwhite people music‚Äù. There‚Äôs a lot of monoculture happening in large swaths of the black community. 

I can‚Äôt imagine being a black metal head. The amount of shit they must take."
s7till,"Freddie Mercury is Parsi, he was born in Zanzibar after his parents immigrated from India.....  


Queen isn't a ""white"" band."
s7till,"Rock is ""white people shit"", sure... Only to name a few living artists: Lenny Kravitz, Tina Turner, Tracy Chapman, even Willow Smith and her mom!"
s7till,That's racist plus Freddy isn't even white.
s7till,"If you heard a white girl slam her boyfriend for enjoying Michael Jackson, Kanye, 50 Cent, etc., with ""that's some black people shit""...how would you feel about that white girl?

Your girlfriend seems to have some...unhelpful...opinions about race, and some gatekeeping/stereotyping regarding how races are ""supposed"" to enjoy music."
s7till,"I don't know about Queen, but ya gals a racist."
s7till,"People are pretty weird lol I never knew someone would give a shit about their music taste because of their race. I'm middle-eastern. Used to listen black metal for idk 6-7 years? At the same time I really really love old school gangster rap. I mainly listen to grunge/alt rock for the past 5 years or so but for example today, I listened the whole Thriller album by Michael Jackson right after I finished listening Every Time I Die's latest album Radical. It's just music man, listen to whatever makes you happy."
s7till,"Good music is good music, regardless of who made it and when. Your girl needs to open her eyes and ears."
s7till,"No, I‚Äôd say that was one hell of a performance and Freddie Mercury commanded and mesmerized the 100,000 fans in attendance. Apparently your gf hates ‚Äúwhite people music.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure if there was a lot of ‚Äúcolored‚Äù people in attendance she wouldn‚Äôt have said that.

And I‚Äôm wonder who the hell said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll like it because it‚Äôs in your culture.‚Äù That‚Äôs about the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard. Apparently you have a lot of, dare I say, racist friends."
s7till,Now play her some Phish or Grateful Dead and see what she says.ü§£
s7till,I identify as racially middle Eastern and Caucasian and I listen to pretty much every genre of music. Piano is also my favorite instrument so when it is played in a song I instantly like it a lot more. Is piano only for white people? I‚Äôm pretty sure piano is played across all genres. If your girlfriend insisted there is ‚Äúwhite people music‚Äù she might consider taking a step back and identifying her own blind prejudice. Music is written by a specific person but is accessible to everyone which makes it such a profound and impressive work of art. Another thing to add: you can dislike something without disparaging it.
s7till,Music isn‚Äôt bound by race. Nothing is.
s7till,People that attribute liking a musical genre to a particular race are fucking idiots.
s7till,Your girlfriend is racist and you should capitalized Queen.
s7till,"As a black person these comments were always made to me since I grew up listening to mostly hard rock, classic rock, funk, bluegrass, electronic, etc. It always bothered me. I wish black people could let go of this narrative that we only rap and sing soul. It‚Äôs kind of sad to hear them to discredit so many black musicians that were pioneers and influences in these genres too."
s7till,He wasn‚Äôt even white
s7till,Dump her bro
s7till,Show her some Bad Brains
s7till,Get rid of her. Nobody needs that kind of negativity in their life.
s7till,"Your girlfriend is either fictional or a fucking racist. Dodge that bullet, bruh. Freddie mercury isn't even white lmao. I bet she thinks Prince is ""white people shit"" smh. She fucking dumb.

Edit: fuck imagine if it was the other way around. Imagine if she put on some hip hop and you said ""this is some black people shit no wonder you like it"". That shit's way out of line."
s7till,Dump her.
s7till,"that was one of the greatest rock performances in history- your girlfriend doesn‚Äôt know shit, respectfully"
s7till,"Break up, this is a flag"
s7till,"queen to me is freddie and brian, though john and roger were a tight rhythm section. i recommend the album innuendo, bar one or two misses there are some amazing songs and when you take in the context surrounding the record (ie. freddie dying of aids and getting hounded by the media at the time essentially waiting for him to die) you really get a sense of what a great band they were. i suppose they were in some ways quite an excessive band but when they were great they were and are one of the greats"
s7till,I am South Asian and i love Queen
s7till,wasn‚Äôt freddie‚Ä¶ yk not white?
s7till,Music has no race.
s7till,"Imagine telling someone admiring a mixed-ethnicity african singer who was born and raised off the coast of Tanzania that this admiration is ""white people shit."""
s7till,Who doesn‚Äôt like Queen or Freddie Mercury? Bad taste in music perhaps? But umm I‚Äôd be irked too.
s7till,"Not white. I think even if you don't care about the band, Queen's performance during Live Aid was iconic, whether it was some ""white ppl shit"" or not."
s7till,"Rock was invented by black musicians, and Freddie was Indian. 

Jimi Hendrix arguably the GOAT of ahem‚Ä¶ rock. 

Chuck MF Berry, for cryin‚Äô out loud. 

Your girlfriend knows not what she‚Äôs talking about."
s7till,"So instead of focusing on the pure musical talent that was Freddie Mercury and Queen, she hones in on race. 

Your girlfriend either is a racist, or a racist who thinks she can get away with her racism. 

So that means only white people can enjoy ‚Äúwhite shit‚Äù? What about black people? Or Asians? Or Brown people? Is she saying they can‚Äôt enjoy Freddie Mercury, because that‚Äôs some ‚Äúwhite shit‚Äù?

How insulting."
s7till,"Freddie Mercury is known for creating and performing very accomplished western music, while being born in Zanzibar with parents from Western India and being educated in India."
s7till,Queen actually had a pretty large black following back in the day.
s7till,"This may be a red flag for your GF. Shows how small minded she is. Besides being bigoted, that‚Äôs just ignorant. Queen is an all time classic"
s7till,Queen‚Äôs live aid performance is considered by many to be among the best live concerts of all time.
s7till,"Queen was a gift to all of us, no matter what colour your skin is. Fuck that shit, we are in this together, enjoy a kind of magic, find it where you can!"
s7till,Art and passion shouldn‚Äôt be segregated by race. Defeats the whole purpose of expression and enjoyment in my opinion. Sounds like she‚Äôs just playing though.
s7till,"Freddie Mercury himself was born in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, his parents were both from the Parsi region of Western India. However the land it covered is now Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. 

If she's calling a band fronted by a man of colour ""some white shit"" if she isn't white well fuck she is one presumptuous woman. How does she treat white passing First Nations or Native American people? M√©tis people? Half white, half Mexican people such as yourself?

She sounds petty, angry, judgemental, and certainly sounds like she has something against people she sees as ""less than"" her. 

I'm a M√©tis man. I pass as white, but myself and my people lost the exact same culture, language, and land that the First Nations people experienced in Canada. We had to give up our culture and livelihood to hide, but were still sent to Residential Schools, and were victims of the 60s Scoop. I've had tons of people, POC and white people assume I'm white and they get the same fuck you, fuck your diminishment and destruction of my culture. Freddie Mercury, or Farrokh Bulsara would've said the exact same thing that I do today. 

This is the type of person who holds you back with her own judgement and hatred. I'd be gone in a heartbeat."
s7till,"My wife is Latina and she has jokingly said some music I listen to is ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù music‚Ä¶but so have I and I‚Äôm white, lol. My wife also loves plenty of ‚Äúwhite people music.‚Äù Hell, our first date was to a Dave Matthews Band concert (who she loves) and she‚Äôs gone to a couple Phish shows with me (who she tolerates lol).

If it‚Äôs a lighthearted thing, don‚Äôt really see much of an issue besides different tastes. But if it‚Äôs dismissing entire bands‚Äô catalogues or entire genres of music, that‚Äôs pretty lame. Making fun of peoples music taste should stop when you turn like 15.

I‚Äôve also gained an enormous appreciation for Latin music over the years through her and her dad, who‚Äôs a salsa musician."
s7till,"Racism goes all directions and that‚Äôs some very negative segregation ideas she has about music and people that should listen to certain types of music. As a white person who isn‚Äôt the biggest fan of Queen and listened to a mix of stuff like Tech N9ne and Tool/Puscifer type music that idea is crazy to me. I like each artist for their individual talent and lyrics and sound. I am white and dated a black girl once and it pissed her mom off so much that she would dare bring white blood into the family and it shocks me to this day that people are still so racist this day in age. Unfortunately not everyone realistically knows they are being racist and promoting otherisms and shit like that. 
I like music for skill in the lyrical messages and such. 
Reminds me when I got in a major argument with my step mom because I had the BET channel on when I was like 15 and watching something on there, don‚Äôt remember what. But the remark of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt watch black tv in this house‚Äù added fuel to a life long hatred toward her. She has changed much in many years since then but I will never forget the blind hatred and how much I aim to never be anything like that. My rant which no one cares about is over.."
s7till,Yeah...Freddie wasn't white and an incredible vocalist so I'm sorry she can stfu when it comes to him haha. Am I fucking tired of hearing bohemian rhapsody? Yes. (I am black). I would sooner say that about Taylor Swift or someone much more annoying than  Freddie ever was.
s7till,Saying that is some racist people shit.
s7till,"Sorry to break the news to you: all her qualities aside, GF is a stupid ignorant racist."
s7till,freddie was born in zanzibar which i believe is in africa
s7till,Freddy Mercury was middle eastern.
s7till,"Gatekeepers suck 

If you enjoy something just fucking enjoy it and all the haters can suck it.

I live in a city thats 60%+ African American i worked at a steel mill that was about that %. When I broke out DJ Kool and Parliament on my iPod I got a few looks. ""What? Good is good. Just because I'm white with long hair doesn't mean I listen to only Metallica and Slayer""....I mean I do but I listen to almost anything.

Hell my Pandora has as much rap on it as I have german industrial metal. 


I mean shit even Ice-T has a metal band
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Count_(band)"
s7till,That‚Äôs a silly comment. Music has no color.
s7till,"Music transcends race, gender, nationality, sexuak orientation etc."
s7till,"Parsi-Indian and his real name was Farrokh Bulsara. Also what so bad about white music, I enjoy plenty of bands and ethnicity doesn't matter to me as long as I enjoy the music. Pretty racist thoughts  and considering that most modern music is based off of black music in the past, I'm not sure why someone would say white people shit."
s7till,I‚Äôd probably just laugh and keep listening to whatever I wanted.
s7till,Doesn't sound like a debate to me. Sounds like your girlfriend has a problem with white people.
s7till,Who doesn‚Äôt love Queen though? Genuine question.
s7till,"That‚Äôs just kinda of a gross thing to say. 
Not to be that guy but like... what the duck does it matter"
s7till,"I have a memory of being in the 9th grade and asking my friend what he was listening to. He said ""the new Dr.Dre, wanna listen?"" and I said something akin to it being black people music and wondering why he was listening to it. Spent the next 6-7 years listening to blink 182 until the hip hop bug hit me. Ended up playing in a few RnB/Hip Hop bands and just became obsessed. Turns out I was just ignorant and wasn't allowing myself to like things that I might like strictly because it seemed like it wasn't for me. My loss for many years. People gonna be ignorant."
s7till,"You know your girlfriend better than us. If by ""white people shit"" she means ""corney"" then she's entitled to that opinion. I've talked to some younger people who think music recorded before the 90s sounds old timey. The pre-digital age music recorded on magnetic tape has a sound they don't like. That could be strike 1 for Queen depending on her age. Freddy getting up in front of people and yodeling while the audience smiles and waves their hands in the air might also seem cornery to people who think they're too cool for it, but people usually grow out of that."
s7till,This is the power of ideology.
s7till,"You‚Äôre girl got some issues, move on"
s7till,Lmao your girlfriend is acting like a 60 year old 'real salt of the earth' midwesterner who just heard rap for the first time.
s7till,your girl is dumb as shit
s7till,Freddie transcends race. He is only Freddie. And fabulous as hell.
s7till,Your girlfriend sounds like she's a racist twat
s7till,"I think it's rather sad she looks at it that way. There's such a vast amount of music out there by white folks...it's such a weird way to segregate yourself.

So much hip-hop and R&B actually samples ""white music"". Maybe dig out some of that info to bust her ignorance?

Freddie wasn't even strictly ""white"" anyway...he was Asian I believe, although of course he was fairly light-skinned and his band-mates were white...but still.

Hopefully she broadens her mind a little more in future...she's missing out...for no good reason at all."
s7till,I seriously pity anyone who lives with tiny box of music genres that‚Äôs culturally and racially acceptable to them..  there‚Äôs so much music out there to enjoy if you just open yourself to it.
s7till,How is Queen white people music? What dictates what race can/should listen to certain music. What a fucking stupid thing to say.
s7till,Queen is one of those bands that is above race.
s7till,"Freddie Mercury was Persian, so (Indo-?) Iranian, for goodness‚Äô sakes, and he was one of the most talented individuals in modern history regardless of his skin color and ethnicity!! Why not just appreciate talent for talent like you have done?"
s7till,Freddie Mercury's from fucking Tanzania.
s7till,Your GF said some racist crap.  She needs to know she said some racist crap.  And if she says you can't be racist toward white people.  Leave.  She'll only get worse.  I love music for music's sake.  I don't care about what color you are.
s7till,"No and your girlfriend might be a bit (or a lot) racist. If she took a moment to even look up Queen, she'd know they Freddy Mercury isn't white AND Queen is enjoyed but more than Caucasians.   
If she's not racist, she sure seems to easily be prejudiced against something she doesn't care to understand."
s7till,"He wasn't even white nor am i and i love Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody is the Greatest Song ever imo."
s7till,"Freddie is Indian East-african, your girl racist as fuck. Plus also Live aid was to feed the fucking African countries affected by famine.

Drop that girl. She's ignorant and not worth your time"
s7till,"bro imagine thinking listening to music made by a white person is somehow ""bad"" and fucking good lord imagine thinking freddie fucking mercury is white lmfao talk about woke bullshit"
s7till,"I can't even remember what they played at Live Aid but they are definitely some amazing white shit.  Show tunes, complex melodies, straight ahead rock beats.  Ya.  Go figure."
s7till,"Good to know your gf is not only racist, but doesn't know what shes talking about as well. I don't imagine you too going far if you enjoy things and she can only think that 'its white people shit'

I don't think this attitude would only apply to music, but generally anything you'd want to do that she doesn't want to do."
s7till,"Honestly,  there is going to be times when she says dumb shit.  The mature thing to do is let it roll off your back, throw on a Queen album and just revel in the fact that she's not going to feel the deep connection with the music like you will.  It's a personal connection that makes you,  you.  

Long live Queen."
s7till,Dump her close minded ass
s7till,"Shit. Even Grandmaster Flash sampled Queen. You going to tell me he has no influence, directly or otherwise, on today's hip hop?"
s7till,"That makes me a little sad, because all music should belong to everyone. I guess some people might dismiss that attitude as privileged because I‚Äôm a white dude, so I ‚Äúfeel entitled to own all the culture.‚Äù   But no, man. Music is fucking music, not a culture war. Love your Queen, Queen is awesome. So is mother fucking Marvin Gaye, and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise."
s7till,"I recently had some face time with a fairly famous black (African-American) musician, and after 45 minutes of pleasantries and softball questions I asked  what he thought of a passage from a critic's review that I proceeded to read to him. This review was overall complimentary with just one caveat (*nothing* to do with race). 

The musician's dismissive response? ""Lemme guess, that was written by a *white* guy.""

So disappointing that that's where he immediately went."
s7till,Your gf sounds racist
s7till,"Freddie Mercury was impressive in this performance for his ability to control the crowd. You can think his music is ""white people music"" or not even like it at all, but his style and genre has nothing to do with why this is one of the most highly acclaimed performances in music history. It was his ability to command the crowd in a similar way to what DMX [did at Woodstock 99](https://youtu.be/xjsnALVN1DU). So this ability to conduct a crowd and incorporate them into his art is what has made this performance legendary. It has nothing to do with the actual music being played despite the music itself being epic."
s7till,"LOL man I would legit leave them. I‚Äôm indigenous and no music is yt or blk. How limiting and incredibly musically uneducated of a comment. People think it‚Äôs okay to hate of people because of jealousy I‚Äôve found as well. Usually a result of a fragile ego, or just straight up internal lack of following their own passion."
s7till,"If she doesn‚Äôt see the genius of Freddie Mercury, she doesn‚Äôt understand music‚Ä¶ too bad"
s7till,"If race is what comes to mind when you hear/see the genius that is Freddie Mercury, you're an uncultured twat regardless of your race."
s7till,Your ladybis a racist POS. Ditch her ü§∑. Freddy is the greatest vocalist of all time!
s7till,"Isn't Freddie Mercury South Asian? And of Persian descent? 

Also who gives a shit? If you like Queen, like Queen. Your gf can hate all she wants."
s7till,Dump her.
s7till,"In this case, ignorance is not bliss. It‚Äôs just plain ol‚Äô ignorance. I don‚Äôt think the members of Queen made music with ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù people in mind. They made music because it‚Äôs who they are and what they loved to do. You‚Äôre obviously bothered enough from her comment to ask about it. But really, learn to shut that shit down real quick and enjoy what you love üé∂"
s7till,"Asian here, it would be hard for me to pick a favorite singer/performer out of everyone but I can safely say Freddie Mercury is in my top 3, and most of what I listen to isn't even in English."
s7till,You should see what she thinks of Hendrix.
s7till,"Our brain works in the strangest ways. We admire something that objectively doesn't exist, or exists only for us. We admire vibrations in the air, changing colors, put in so much meaning into it so it can affect our relations with our family. It never fails to amaze me how it is important for us (I am by no means an exception) and if this feeling of importance is good for us. And what a shame it would be if we all fucking kill each other over our differences that don't matter at all and this beautiful feeling of joy over something abstract will cease to exist forever."
s7till,Queen is rock. Rock is for everybody. Rock is good.
s7till,"Your girlfriend seems to be ignorant, racist and might have a very bad taste concerning music."
s7till,"So, yeah, that would annoy me‚Ä¶ and I am not a POC, but it‚Äôs just a complete disregard for the level of talent. I grew up listening to Motown and Michael Jackson because the music makes me feel good, and it has nothing to do with race. It‚Äôs just the most talented artists ever, performing some of the best music ever, and Queen absolutely fits in the same category. They‚Äôre literally one of the best bands of all time.

That being said, my girlfriend does not like all of the same things that I do and she can be indelicate about it at times. If you love each other, you should battle through it."
s7till,"Go search up ‚Äúqueen reaction‚Äù on YouTube and show your dumbass gf all the black folks loving the shut out of that band and Freddie!
Then dump her dumb ass."
s7till,‚ÄúThat‚Äôs white people shit‚Äù And that‚Äôs just straight forward racism. You have a garbage partner.
s7till,Lemmy has something to say that I think is mildly relevant. https://youtu.be/skGEBgePHtk
s7till,I didn't even know that was a thing!! White people listening to rock! Must be an American thing!! Rock music is the best genre of music there is. She should keep her mouth shut and watch the greatest gig of all time.
s7till,"Your gif is racist, you knew it when you posted here.  Reddit confirms it. Next case!"
s7till,"I am white and straight. Invariably will be somebody to point out ""how can you like Queen, you know that their leder was gay?""

People with low IQ will find anything to hate, because their thinking is tribal, basic ""us"" versus ""them"". Hating ""other"" groups of people somehow raises their own self-esteem.

Love what you love and don't be put in a box by others!"
s7till,Freddie Mercury isn't even white.
s7till,‚ÄúWhile people shit‚Äù kinda racist no? ‚Ä¶..let‚Äôs turn it around and say that‚Äôs ‚Äúblack people shit‚Äù ‚Ä¶..doesn‚Äôt sound right does it?
s7till,"Assuming she wasn't joking:
I'd ask what she means by that. Was there an actual reason for that comment or was it just bullshit? Cuz it certainly sounds like an empty angle to me.
Queen is global.
Everyone is free to enjoy the fruits of creativity and art, it is most definitely a global thing.

Art is communication, would you say that only certain ppl allowed to communicate or recieve it? No.
Real things which matter are inclusive cuz it speaks to people, not their genes or looks.

Culture has an effect on ppl's preceptions, race on it's own don't rly matter. A lot of things can be understood n appreciated without having to be brought up in a certain culture. I mean... Freddie was mainly Indian wasn't he? He spoke with an Indian accent as well. Is his singing ""Indian shit"" now? Nah, it's complete nonsense, no substance, not even an argument. Stop tribalism, it's cringe. And gatekeeping art is not only disrespectful to you but to the artist as well.

Imagine going up to someone watching a documentary on the ways of the samurai and telling them ""that's some asian people shit"". It's just kinda... It has no real meaning n it sounds kinda dismissive. Besides, Japanese ppl have their own culture, the term ""asian"" doesn't really describe the culture.
Same with the term ""white ppl"", Russians have a culture which greatly differs from Italians for example. It's kinda disingenuous to lump ppl together like that.

I'd just ask her what she's referring to, cuz I don't really know, truthfully. And then if I got a stupid answer I'd ask her not to generalize ppl so much and ""gatekeep"" art cuz it's kinda cringe and illogical.

Kinda offtopic but:

Ppl r way too identified with their genes and culture, ppl have too much ""pride"", and are scared to be an individual, then get mad if they get seen as a stereotype when they follow the herd and become exactly like that.

What matters is what one does, that's it.
Ppl act like kids all around the world didn't wanna be like Jet Li cuz they weren't the same ""race"" so they couldn't relate. It's just bullshit. It's literally not true. Long tangent but what I'm trying to say is:
Don't pay attention to ppl's closed minded comments, they literally make no sense, enjoy your music! Stay blessed"
s7till,Sounds like your girlfriend has some racist issues with herself to sort out
s7till,"What the fuck is with Americans and skin colour lmao. Saying stuff is for white people or stuff is for black people is so stupid, rude and ignorant."
s7till,"If you're half white, you're more white than Freddie Mercury was lol"
s7till,"A lot of folks here seem to be missing that racial segregation is music is a huge thing. I read Mariah Carey's book on how Sony had a hard time with her image. She was mostly white passing until she got heavier into R&B in the late 90s, which was a problem because that's considered 'black music'. 

A black and a white artist both release a pop song. The same exact song. The black artists is immediately thrown in the R&B/Urban category."
s7till,She sounds ratchet ngl
s7till,"I get why this would bother you but holy shit, this thread... thank you for making a haven for fragile white people to vent about all the 'racism' they've experienced.

and, I love Queen and yes Freddie wasn't actually white, but let's be real. Queen is some SUPER white people shit. That's ok."
s7till,"Music transcends skin color and race. For anyone to think ""that's some white people (or \*any* skin color) shit,"" is both closed-minded and bigoted.

Also, tell your girl Freddie Mercury wasn't white: [His parents were Parsi Indian --from India, making him 100% Indian as well-- and he was born in Africa.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury)"
s7till,I wouldn't say that because that's racist.
s7till,"I wonder if your girlfriend is aware that rock and roll comes directly out of the Black American musical experience (jazz, R&B, gospel, boogie-woogie, etc.)?"
s7till,Freddie Mercury wasn't a white person.
s7till,"Music is universal. No other way to slice it. You don‚Äôt like something? That‚Äôs completely fine. The color of your skin, just like so many things, has no place in this debate. 

That performance purely based on execution alone is beyond legendary and she should feel bad. 

/s 

Help her see the error in her ways."
s7till,My friend. Queen is universal as is music in overall. Plus as you say it‚Äôs his performance and the control of the crowd in that moment of time. It is electrifying to watch.
s7till,"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs some ignorant shit, because he ain‚Äôt even white‚Äù"
s7till,"They have some great songs, timeless classics if you don't know Queen i doubt you know anything about music in general."
s7till,Music isn't white people shit or black people shit. It's for everyone.
s7till,"Music is music dude. I'm white, and I love hip hop. 

At the end if the day, good music is good music, regardless of genre, or the race of the composer."
s7till,Your girl ain't no Queen.
s7till,"No, I‚Äôd say the first thing I said when I first saw it as a teenager: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one Hell of a performance‚Äù"
s7till,And I thought music spoke all languages.
s7till,Is she talking about the performance or the live aid concert in general?
s7till,Your gf sounds racist mate
s7till,Perhaps Parliament-Funkadelic is a vintage band that's more to her liking. lol
s7till,"Such blasphemy, the only answer is to dump her immediately"
s7till,Well Race is everything now don't you know?  You have sum everything up into you racial group.
s7till,Wasn't Freddie Indian?
s7till,"Personally I consider Queen the greatest rock band of all time so I am biased in saying ""That's some stone cold crazy bullshit"". Nothing inherently race related about the beauty of Freddie's voice or the bombast of May's guitar or the locked in grooves of Deacon and Taylor. That being said I can see the association along cultural lines.

Queen puff piece aside, I agree that her response at best dismissive of your interest and at worst a snap racial judgement of something. Neither are respectful. I would be hit, and rightly so, for saying something along the same lines about K-Pop, RnB, Bollywood etc."
s7till,"Good music is good music, doesn't matter what ethnicity you are.

I'm a thoroughly white, British metalhead. Does that mean I can't appreciate 90s Hip Hop from Compton? No it bloody doesn't because some of that stuff absolutely rips. 

I'd say you're right to be irritated, music is supposed to bring people together!"
s7till,it's not that serious
s7till,anyone can appreciate any type of music
s7till,"I think we all have known people like your gf and honestly, it speaks a lot to their maturity. I might have said something like that as a rap-obsessed teenager. She‚Äôs so close minded. Is she not aware that the earliest pioneers of rock music were black?

ETA I see you mentioned that to her, great job. Next step, find a nice cultured girl with better taste. Best of luck."
s7till,"I don‚Äôt think this is a question about music, but I believe it‚Äôs an important conversation that we should all have often. Personally, I would be more interested in what your girl would think if she heard the audio only and could not see the video. I think that might take the ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù out of it, lol. 

Old guy/musician rant:
My favorite thing about music is that it has no preference, it‚Äôs just sound. No color, race, ethnicity, no religion, no sexual orientation, no bias‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just sound created from sounds we‚Äôve discovered and been influenced by over our years of existence. We as individuals either like it, or we don‚Äôt. The music doesn‚Äôt give a shit what we think, it‚Äôs just there to be shared and enjoyed or not. 

Stay positive friend!"
s7till,"Something can be good and enjoyable, whilst also being ""white people shit"". 

If you like it, you like it. Just embrace that it's white people shit."
s7till,"Lmao this is similar to when Isaiah Rashad blasted fantano for giving his album a mediocre review and saying he can't appreciate it cause he's white and doesn't acknowledge the black music experience

I mean sure bro if your music ain't for him and he says that, that's his opinion. But Fantano has done so much for black underground artists that you can understandably say he appreciates and recognises the background and context of their music. 
You just made a generic album that had no innovation."
s7till,That‚Äôs a pretty popular ‚Äúfunny‚Äù thing to say these days. That‚Äôs some white people shit. I hear it all the time. She was probably just trying to be funny. Maybe just educate her on why that was kind of a dumb thing to say.
s7till,There are a million youtube reaction videos of nonwhite people going nuts on Queens Live Aid performance. Maybe show a couple of those?
s7till,Sounds like you're dating a racist.
s7till,"Tell her that's racist, and you don't appreciate it."
s7till,"Honestly sounds like your girlfriend is just ignorant....

Is she 'hood'? ü§îü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
s7till,Your girl is dumb
s7till,I would call her out on her racism
s7till,"Sounds like you got a winner.

grats."
s7till,"Latin here, it really just boils down to what you were raised around. My family always had on different radio stations playing so I already knew who queen was before I ever saw live aid."
s7till,She‚Äôs the uncultured one bro. If she reduces everything down to that
s7till,Your girlfriend is a racist. Sorry.
s7till,"My boyfriend does this shit all the time and so does my best friend lol.  They are Hispanic and black respectively and tell me i do white people shit all the time. Queen is enjoyed by people of all races but I'm happy to have something as positive and awesome as Queen referred to as ""white people shit"" cuz, honestly, most of the time when i hear that, it's either something super negative and/or embarrassing lol"
s7till,Your girlfriend is clearly racist.  I‚Äôd move on from that mess personally.
s7till,"So when she is listing to rap, you have the right to say, ""that's some black people's shit"" and walk away. The fact that people are not geared to listening to different styles of music does make me wonder about people's music tastes. I am glad you are able to be open-minded and try and listen to new things since it shows growth."
s7till,I love Queen! I am an Asian.
s7till,Your girlfriend is ignorant
s7till,Queen's great! Much bigger now than in their day.  I understand people not liking different kinds of music.  I would never attribute anything to color. Why limit yourself?  There's too much good stuff out there. Girls too. Enjoy!
s7till,If I were you. I would leave her immediately.
s7till,Sorry Brodie she just not very educated lol you can‚Äôt reason with that mindset.
s7till,I‚Äôm Asian/Pacific Islander and Queen was one of the first bands I got into.  With respect your GF is wrong.  Queen is universal.  Music is universal.  It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwhite peoples shit‚Äù it‚Äôs music that is good and if it moves you what does it matter what race the band is?  You and your gf should also check out some of the reaction videos on YouTube to see how people of all races dig Queen.
s7till,"Good music transcends race.  There's no such thing as music that's simply ""white people shit"".  If someone is moved by something they hear, then that music is for them, irrespective of how they look.  And if someone's not into something they hear, that's just how it is, not everything is gonna move every person.  That having been said, I think your girlfriend is partly dead inside."
s7till,That‚Äôs racist
s7till,"Insulting someone for enjoying art from any culture is some bitch shit. Disrespecting good music, theatrical and musical technique is some ignorant shit."
s7till,"Okay White 33yo Male here

&#x200B;

I've actually come back and hunted down this thread cause its pissed me off no end now

&#x200B;

If your black and like Thrash metal then enjoy it, if your white and like gangster rap then enjoy it, if your Asian and like country then enjoy it. Music is one of the great bringers together of everyone so to segregate it to ethnicity is doing music a great injustice and denying us all a platform to stand together as one. There is no such thing as White Only Music or Black Only Music, Music is Music for all

&#x200B;

So like what you like, don't be a dick and just get lost in genres and music that you love and help you get through the day"
s7till,"  There‚Äôs a couple low blows you could take if you wanted to equivocate her statement with the same racism reflected back at her, but she probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize it to be the irony that it is, and think you‚Äôre just being racist right back.

Sometimes the little things people say really tell you who they are"
s7till,"I'm also mixed and love me some Queen. I generally don't like it and find saying ""That's some white people shit"" extremely short sighted and self conscious, but it does work wonders on ultra PC eggshell type of leftist totalitarianism crowd.

But yeah...fuck your GF. Good music is good music and like most things, is subjective. Liking something because you think you have to because of some predetermined uncontrollable factor in your life is beyond sad and moronic. Dump her"
s7till,"Why do you care? Tell her to not be racist and continue listening to the band you like. If you are trying to argue that listening to Queen isnt at least closer to ""white culture"" than any other, I dont know what to tell you."
s7till,"Robert Johnson, Bo Diddley, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Big Joe Turner, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Muddy Waters, Chubby Checker, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, John Lee Hooker, Funkadelic, Bad Bones, Slash (African-American mother), Tracy Chapman, Living Colour, Tina Turner, Lenny Kravitz, William Duvall, Brittany Howard, Howard Jones, and Derrick Green.

I'm not sure what her point is, but the founders of rock n roll were mostly black, and there are myriad great artists throughout the genre's history.

Rock wouldn't wouldn't be rock without black artists."
s7till,"I‚Äôm white. But also a musician, including piano. And a fan of the history of music, from early blues through r&b, soul, rock, and then some. We don‚Äôt have good music without the massive contributions of the black community. But there is no shame nor easy demographic containment of Freddy at his best. That Queen performance is among the best that‚Äôs ever been performed on any stage for any audience. It‚Äôs not white people shit, it‚Äôs an act of God. You‚Äôre right to like it. P.S. Search Youtube for the black guy hearing Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time. He damn near weeps."
s7till,"This isn‚Äôt a music issue. This is a ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you have a better girlfriend‚Äù issue. And I don‚Äôt know her race but as far as Black GenX & Boomers go, we love Queen. So not only is she rude to you & unnecessarily dismissive of you, she talking out the side of her neck.(depending on her race)"
s7till,Your girl is being obtuse...Queen were HUGE in Central and South America. Somebody to Love was inspired by Freddie's love of RnB and  gospel  music. Another one bites the Dust was a top hit on soul and RnB charts and got extensive play on black stations around the country. Queen had something for everyone
s7till,"Yeah dude. I think you're taking this rather serious. 

Remember it's really up to you on how you'll take that comment. 

It would have been just as easy to see it as a joke, shrug it off,  and go about your day."
s7till,"Musical genius often helps bridge genres from different backgrounds. Little Richard and Chuck Berry brought hopped-up Blues to a wider audience. I am 100% sure people called their music ""Black people music"", but the kids listening didn't care who was playing it. They thought it was amazing, and it changed the world. Freddy was obviously a musical genius, supremely gifted. Watching some of those performances in front of massive crowds is truly awe-inspiring. He (and the band) had them all in the palm of his hand. He loved it. They loved it."
s7till,I understand what you are saying‚Ä¶music doesn‚Äôt have a color does it?  For some reason she felt the need to say that but it hurt you as you love music.  Try to teach her this love.
s7till,"Freddy Mercury was a Rock Artist.

Rock is Derived from Jazz

Jazz is Derived from Classical

Rock is common in the White cultural setting

Jazz was created in the Black cultural setting, using influence from Black (African) Music

Classical music, aka The Musical Style of 18th century Western European Music, was formulated by White Europeans.

In total, that makes Rock White People music, Rebranded for Black People, with Black People's Musical Gestures mixed in, which was then again Rebranded for White People.

So all in all, rock's history is arguably just as much White as it is Black. 

In otherwords, ""it don't matter if you're black or white"" üòé

Jokes aside, nah. Music is Music, and the phrase ""I can(n't) see why you like that"" should be the default perspective for anyone who enjoys music."
s7till,I‚Äôm a white person who doesn‚Äôt like Queen. But I do respect Freddie Mercury as a musician and performer. He was insanely talented.
s7till,"Leaving the blatant ignorance of the matter aside... the set from live aid specifically is a bit stereotypically arena rock which I guess is where she's getting the impression... 

However queen as a whole....that's another matter. 

For example: When ""Another One Bites the Dust"" released on the radio it go picked up by a lot of ""black"" radio stations in the States and many had no idea the band was 3 white dudes and a guy of Indian heritage.

Also... my turn to be racist (in jest)  bet she'd like that one...its in her culture.... not serious tho.... but serious... play that with no explanation bet she starts vibin"
s7till,"Hell no! First off, Freddy is Asian and secondly color has nothing to do with music. I love and appreciate music regardless of the colour of the person who created it. If anything it sounds kind of racist to me ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
s7till,"Sorry but that‚Äôs some uncultured swine shit. Hard pass, you dodged a bullet. My go to vibe test was actually see if a person would play the air guitar on bohemian rhapsody when it plays. üòÇ"
s7till,"""Queen"" should be capitalized because it's a proper name. Initially didn't know what your title meant."
s7till,My Asian Dad connected with my white mom over their love of Queen. He‚Äôs a super fan
s7till,"Don't even know what to say. Makes me sad that this is the new generation coming through. We're becoming more and more divided. Your GF is an ignorant, racist, bigoted fool. Sorry, but there is no other way to say it. If all you do is see 'race' in everything, you're going to have a sad life."
s7till,"Play something like Thin Lizzy. If she brings up it being ""white people music"" then remind her that Phil Lynott was half-black.  While you're at it, you can tell her that Farrokh Bulsara who became Freddie Mercury was Parsi-Indian."
s7till,Never realized he was white üòÇü§£üòÇ
s7till,Racist comments!
s7till,Wow. Why a nice girlfriend you got there.
s7till,"Sounds kind of racist to me, I couldn't imagine saying that to any other ethnicity."
s7till,She's kind of a dumb bigot.
s7till,"Hey I'm Black in my 40's and watched that live back in the day. I love me some Queen. I also listen to RnB, rap, rock, metal oldies, alternative. You name it I love it because I love music. People ask me why I listen to ""white people "" music. Because I like all music that's good. Why miss out on good music because it isn't in my culture."
s7till,"How are music and race associated? Holy shit, only in America‚Ä¶"
s7till,Your girlfriend is racist
s7till,"What's wrong with ""white people shit""? Does your girlfriend dislike it because she associates it with white people? That's kinda racist."
s7till,"Jeez, what a cupid stunt."
s7till,"It‚Äôs depressing as hell that this is a criticism anyone thinks is valid.

Your girlfriend has a weird, weird take here."
s7till,"Coming from a black family I can say I got that a lot too, being ridiculed just for liking an artist that‚Äôs a different color from you"
s7till,Your girlfriend sounds like a racist bitch. Listen to whatever the fuck you want. I can't stand this race-baity gatekeeping shit.
s7till,Sounds like she doesn't really know you at all!
s7till,Hey....your friend should understand....that's RACIST!
s7till,Music is color blind. So is food. Both are mediums that should bring all people together.
s7till,"People keep bringing up how freddie wasnt white like that was the point, which it wasnt. But even then, to an unworldy person, freddie looks white. Psa, a lot of people dont know Queen"
s7till,Leave her
s7till,"Hate to be that guy, but your girlfriend saying something ignorant to you doesn't really qualify as a ""debate."""
s7till,"Personally I would have said ""that's why it's good""..."
s7till,Sounds like your girlfriend might be racist.
s7till,Your girlfriend is racist.
s7till,Maybe try listen to some Kpop or something and see what she says. Pretty closed minded if you cant enjoy music just because of the colour of the person who made it or the language its sung in etc.
s7till,you‚Äôre girlfriend is ignorant that‚Äôs that
s7till,"Your gf sounds like not a good person. Be aware of how she brings that kind of bullshit to other situations and don't hesitate to leave the relationship when the time comes...  Like now, maybe. 
  
I'm NOT saying to break up with her due to her comments but I'd bet money that it's illustrative of a larger problem with her attitude that pervades other aspects of your relationship too. Good luck to you, friend."
s7till,"""At least it ain't black people shit"" then assume defense position :s    


Also obligatory this is red flag + racism"
s7till,Your girlfriend sounds like a dumbass.
s7till,So she's racist?
s7till,Your girlfriend sounds quite bigoted tbh
s7till,Gatekeeping music by colour of skin is cringe af
s7till,Imagine white people saying that about typical black music like blues or jazz and see how stupid it sounds.
s7till,It's amazing how ignorant people are.  Music is for everyone.  If you like it you like it.  Plain and simple it's art.  Plus clearly she doesn't know wtf she is talking about. 90% of rap artists would be completely broke and unheard of if only black people listened to them.  Music should break down barriers not enforce them.
s7till,"You know, you can like what you like. Doesn't need to have race attached."
s7till,"Corrected statement, that‚Äôs some human people shit. Why can‚Äôt we all sign up to be humanitarians‚Ä¶we r all humans, forget all the government made labels‚Ä¶let‚Äôs shit on the martians or whatever aliens are coming for us since NASA / SpaceEx be poking around so much up there!"
s7till,Imagine how I must feel listening 99% to classical music as a (fellow?) Black dude lol
s7till,"Freddy is not white. Rock music is absolutely not completely white: Jimi Hendrix, Tom Morello, Slash etc. What are you talking about?"
s7till,"I've always hated people who assigned tastes in music to skin color or culture. I'm black, but enjoy listening to heavy metal, death metal, electronic, japanese, lofi, RnB, classical, etc. If I like a genre of music I like it. Your skin color shouldn't define your taste in entertainment.

I've also gotten that type of response from others before. No offense to your girlfriend, but that response is really ignorant in my opinion."
s7till,Queen was one of the best bands in the world. And all the dumb rap shit in the world will be forgotten. But the band Queen will be remembered even in 200-300 years from now. Because they were great and unique like Mozart or Beethoven.
s7till,"""That's racist"""
s7till,"Man, I hate people who categorizes music by race. Music is music doesn't matter what genre it is. I love Metallica especially the 90s/00s Era. Do I get a lot of shit for it? Absolutely. But it's my tastes and I'll die defending Load/Reload. St. Anger is NOT a great album, but it helped me get out of depression."
s7till,Your GF is a dumb bitch
s7till,racism is such a wonderful concept. it doesn't exclude anyone no matter which side of the fence you're standing on as well..........
s7till,Sometimes I reckon the world would be a kinder place if being born blind was a normal thing.
s7till,Wait til she finds out which ethnic group pioneered rock music. I'm pretty sure white people had less to do with that than we like to give ourselves credit for.
s7till,Shes racist
s7till,Sad that people are racist when it comes to music. Sorry you have to live with a racist.
s7till,"so your race should dictate what u like?

hmmmm my bet is this is ""american shit"""
s7till,Relax. It‚Äôs ignorant youthful banter. Heard that shit all my life. It stops when people around you get older and/or smarter.
s7till,"I listen to metal because that's my preffered choice of genre for the most part. Now I'm Hispanic but I'm light skinned so very many people will know by looking at me that I'm Spanish (black hair dark brown eyes) and I get asked why I don't listen to more Spanish music. Or ""Why you listen to this shit?"" Asked a lot. So on few occasions I was mistaken for a white guy. I find it judgemental immediately and tell them refer to Google to learn because there are black metal bands and literally *Black Death* comes to mind. Music isn't defined as a certain race or type of person. If you hear bachata or salsa but you see a bunch of black people dancing they don't tell them ""That's some Spanish shit."" There are black country singers, Asian metal bands, Rappers from London etc. I've got a black friend who's more of a metal head than I am and he's shown me some good bands.

Also Queen rocks and your gf needs to hear them more often with an open mind."
s7till,"Several things wrong with that:
Freddie was from Zanzibar
Live Aid was to stop famine in Africa 
And rock and roll was created by black people, chuck berry, little Richard. 
So, tell her she is just a racist who doesn't know anything about music or its history and to not have stupid stereo types around what people listen to."
s7till,I love Queen
s7till,"Freddie Mercury was one of the most phenomenal and charismatic frontmen of all time. The only person who beats him out of number one in my world is Elvis, and that's only because he came first in the order of things. That's ok your gf didn't see the anazingness of Freddie and the band. That's more for us to enjoy."
s7till,The guy is from Tanz√¢nia is not even white üòÇüòÇüòÇ
s7till,"If listening to an Indian guy raise money for starving African kids is ‚Äúwhite people shit‚Äù, then consider me albino Miles Davis. 

Did your girl recently ask all the white people to leave ‚Äúher‚Äù multi cultural center by any chance? We may already know her."
s7till,"Could have told her the Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara, in Zanzibar, freaking Africa."
s7till,"Point out he'd been advised not to perform on medical grounds, and still gave the best performance the world had ever seen."
s7till,Public enemy once sang bohemian rhapsody while traveling to a gig
s7till,"Such a shame race needs to be involved in everything. I‚Äôm glad nobody thinks idiotically like this around me, I wouldn‚Äôt hang with people that are this bitter."
s7till,"Bitch, Queen is for everybody! Freddie is amazing live. What an odd box to stuff yourself into."
s7till,How can (objectively) one of the greatest live performances be just white people shit? Besides it was a global thing. Just watching the control he had over the crowd is mesmerizing. It is a great performance overall no matter what.
s7till,"She‚Äôs not heard Ice-T‚Äôs thrash band Bodycount? They cover the point of small minded people saying black people cant like rock quite a lot in their albums. The entire band is made up of black musicians, and they‚Äôre great!"
s7till,Sorry but you‚Äôre girl just doesn‚Äôt know good music. Play her some Chuck Berry and see if she says that‚Äôs white people shit too‚Ä¶
s7till,"Not at all I as a black male think it's weird that they'd even say that lmao, why queen of all people that's insanely ignorant a lot of black people I know who're older love Queen."
s7till,Lol that's wild. I'm hispanic and have never had anyone tell me that when they see me listening to midwest emo rock bands (which are all white pretty much)
s7till,Hmm I‚Äôm white and I like rap. If a white girl were to say something about me watching an old snoop concert I think I‚Äôd have another white girl slap her for being racist.
s7till,"Kinda weird considering freddie mercury wasn't really white in that sense.



But in the end, who cares? It's just a melanin adaptation."
s7till,"It's racist.  People confuse race with culture, but they aren't the same.  If you grow up somewhere where it's cool to listen to Queen, it's part of your culture.  There is no race requirement except from racist peers who associate music with race.

Gatekeeping works both ways though, so if you hang out with a group of people that only listens to one genre of music, they get pissed off at you.  Ironic how it was like that for me in high school, where people either listened to rap or rock, and it was pretty much straight down color lines.  But rap music was sampling rock music and some of the best rock (rage against the machine) was some of the best rap."
s7till,"Freddie was born in Zanzibar to parsi indian parents but sure, white people shit."
s7till,"So a man born 'Farrokh Bulsara' in Sultanate of Zanzibar who migrated to the UK was gay and lived through the peak of the aids epidemic is just some generic singer of 'white guy' music.

Sounds like someone needs to start thinking before speaking. Also anyone can like whatever the **** they want, don't be a Judgmental Judy like that person."
s7till,Sounds like your girlfriend is racist
s7till,Tell her there's nothing wrong with being white.
s7till,"I suppose according to OP‚Äôs gorlfirend I can‚Äôt listen to Marvin Gaye, Bill Withers, Rage Against the Machine, or Thin Lizzy because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúwhite people shit‚Äù.

Music has no color or language. Art has no barrier, it‚Äôs for all people no matter what demographic."
s7till,"U're both a couple of racist mf.  
Music is music. That's the end. You may like whatever you like, without giving a shit about race.  
I can't believe you don't see that."
s7till,"That's just a straight up racist thing to say.

Also the blues and then rock music were originally developed largely by Black people. Kind of crazy to think that the culture has a distaste for it now."
s7till,"I never understood how something is 'white/black people shit'. How? A white person in California, Ireland, South Africa and fucking Dagistan don't have some shared identity as 'white'. That's not even taking into account the americanised view of white/black that seems to have become the norm now."
s7till,"Your girl is only depriving herself with that attitude; don't allow her to invalidate your musical tastes.  And wait til she learns literally anything about Freddie Mercury's life.

If you want to educate her, have her listen to some black YouTubers who do reaction videos to classic rock songs."
s7till,You're girlfriend is a racist.
s7till,Why is everything about fucking race?!?!
s7till,"Check out Sampha‚Äôs - (No one knows me) like me piano. 

Your girl is just basic."
s7till,Sounds kinda racist ngl. Also Freddy Mercury wasn't even white. He was Parsi-Indian and born in AFRICA.
s8o82t,Deftones :)
s8o82t,Everything Devin Townsend.
s8o82t,Queens of The Stone Age - they are slamming as hell.
s8o82t,"Radiohead. They would play it at parties and I liked it in the moment but never sought it out on my own. Then one day, it snapped into place. Some would say it's like a jigsaw falling into place."
s8o82t,"great question!

hmm i think between the buried and me was pretty big amongst my friends and it took some pushing before i finally gave them a chance. great band!

from my perspective, i tell people all the time how good early aerosmith is. people either forgot or were never aware that like the first several releases from aerosmith are extremely fucking killer bluesy type rock. also i preach the good word of thin lizzy whenever i can haha."
s8o82t,Toby Mac
s8o82t,"LCD Soundsystem. I moved to Asheville, NC after college and my coworkers would blast ""This is Happening"" at least once a week. I moved on from Asheville and kept the tradition alive at my other jobs that followed. I got to see them in 2017 at Forecastle and I think it was the most fun I've ever had at a show. Yep, love some LCD Soundsystem."
s8o82t,Pup. Is one of my now wife‚Äôs favorite bands. When we first started hanging out she was pushing them hard and never gave em a shot. Now one of both of our favorite bands.
s8o82t,King Crimson
s8o82t,Radiohead. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm *in love* now but it‚Äôs a band I avoided precisely because everyone wouldn‚Äôt shut up about them. And my first casual listens all I heard was whiny vocals. Fast forward a decade and a half I revisited the catalog and it clicked. I still think they‚Äôre overrated (fight me) but I can appreciate and enjoy them like I was never able to before.
s8o82t,Animal Collective
s8o82t,Coheed. Finally gave in and my life is changed
s8o82t,King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Took me years to really give them a listen and now they're one of my favorites.
s8o82t,"Honestly, Taylor Swift. Grew up hating her and her pop era. She also can't perform live to save her life. Sooo pitchy. But her last two albums (not rereleases) really gave her new depth and allowed her to showcase her songwriting

Also, so I don't get downvoted, another one is megadeth. Dave mustaine is a god"
s8o82t,Deafheaven. I didn't think it was my cup of tea- turns out I was wrong.
s8o82t,"My younger brother tried to get me to see nwa for years. Never interested. Then, years later, i had the opportunity to visit brixton academy, where they were playing. Cube wasn't there due to police issues but god damn.."
s8o82t,Chelsea Wolfe. My wife has been really into her for years but mostly played a lot of her more depressing stuff. I got into Hiss Spun though and we saw her live a few times. Now I call her the Dark Queen Matron and have dug through more of her catalog than I had before. Also got me into Emma Ruth Rundle and Ionna Gika.
s8o82t,Billy strings!  Now it‚Äôs all I want to listen to and I‚Äôm not upset about it.
s8o82t,"Tool, thank fuck you come around, somethig about the way they produce sound makes me tingle all over. Sublime, sublime make me tingle too."
s8o82t,"I‚Äôm a fan of prog metal like tool, but more heavy. When someone told me to check out Meshuggah i was blown away, and I still get goosebumps any time I hear it or see them play"
s8o82t,Why?
s8o82t,System of a Down was shown to me by multiple people multiple times and I never really liked it or wanted to listen to it. I then finally said fuck it sat down and listened to them and now they‚Äôre like my 3rd fav band
s8ma1l, These words are breathtaking
s7wkrf,"FNM are widely considered, by musicians, to be one of the most influential rock bands of the late '80s/early '90s. They're not underrated at all."
s7wkrf,"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre underrated. They‚Äôre very well known, to gen x, anyway.  If you like Michael Patton, check out his other bands. Peeping Tom and Mr Bungle are also pretty good."
s7wkrf,They care alot
s7wkrf,"Saw them live many years ago when they were warming up for Guns n roses (Use Your Illusion Tour). Mike Patton had so much energy. 

Kept talking about how environmentally friendly they were and encouraged people to throw their rubbish on stage. 

During Epic a flattened can came flying through the air, hit him and split open his eye. Didn't stop him though, just carried on as though nothing had happened with blood pouring down his face.

Awesome!"
s7wkrf,Reddit be like ‚ÄúI was out of the loop on this well known band. They‚Äôre underrated!‚Äù
s7wkrf,"Under-rated. That word gets used too much here.. 

Great fucking band though, and Im glad you appreciate them. Angel Dust was actually pretty popular, btw."
s7wkrf,"OP doesn't understand what ""underrated"" means. 

Anyone ever heard of this obscure little underrated band called Led Zeppelin?"
s7wkrf,"Glad to see everyone else responding knew they weren't underrated. Was listening to King for a Day, today in fact. Love that album"
s7wkrf,"They aren't underrated at all. They are extremely well known and popular. Have been for a very long time.  Christ, Mike Patton is considered one the best vocalists of the last 70 years.  His range is insane.  Like you literally say that they headline festivals, an underated band wouldn't be able to do that."
s7wkrf,"Umm...

I don't think that word means what you think it means. But check out Mr. Bungle and Fantomas."
s7wkrf,Faith No More is widely considered to be one of the best rock bands of the 90's. Don't know how that's underrated.
s7wkrf,"Mr Bungle is underrated.  FNM was widely seen as a next new thing after epic, and Angel Dust was just menacing and unapproachable for the kids that liked Epic. It (Angel Dust) got awful reviews, but is now very well regarded.  Personally I like Bungle better, but I like them both a lot.  Mike Payton, Trevor Dunn, and Trey Spruance we‚Äôre fantastic together.  I suggest you google up ‚ÄòMr Bungle Bizarre Fest‚Äô for an example of Bungle killing it live."
s7wkrf,No they were/are not
s7wkrf,"Saw them in mid nineties, great show.
What stood out was Patton singing a cover of highway star like a lounge singer, was oddly awesome"
s7wkrf,"You DEFINITELY need to listen to the album California by Mr. Bungle. I love FNM, but that album's the best thing Mike Patton ever did, IMO."
s7wkrf,You didn't even mention 2015's Sol invictus.  That album was great.
s7wkrf,"Very highly rated,  not sure what this is about."
s7wkrf,I recall they covered the song Easy and it‚Äôs a real banger.
s7wkrf,I do think they‚Äôre underrated. People that like them love them. But FNM deserved a wider audience. Angel Dust is a fucking masterpiece.
s7wkrf,"Birmingham NEC, U.K., early 90‚Äôs. 

During the gig, someone in the crowd realised that the foam cover to his seat was detachable. Naturally, it was soon spinning through the air across the arena. Pretty soon, the entire arena was full of these seat covers flying around. All this, as Faith No More played Everything‚Äôs Ruined. It‚Äôs one of my favourite memories. 

And there‚Äôs no way Faith No More are underrated. They didn‚Äôt fit comfortably into any genre, but I‚Äôve always thought they‚Äôre probably fine with that."
s7wkrf,What is it?
s7wkrf,"If you get the chance go and see them live, they‚Äôre amazing"
s7wkrf,Their cover to the bee gees is amazing
s7wkrf,Everything that has ever happened is underrated
s7wkrf,"Seen them live twice.

Both shows are #1 and #2 for a single bands live set, of all the bands I‚Äôve seen. Fantomas were amazing live as well. 

Best band the US has ever produced, in my opinion."
s7wkrf,Angel Dust is a masterpiece.
s7wkrf,Angel dust is amazing.
s7wkrf,"Check out their version of war pigs on the live at Brixton academy, savage album, savage version.
 Just do it, I‚Äôm actually going to listen to it myself now,"
s7wkrf,Do you often sing or whistle just for fun?
s7wkrf,[Midlife Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoQIuDEHVng) is a banger.
s7wkrf,"I always felt like they were poorly represented by their most popular songs like Epic and the other singles off The Real Thing, which is a cool album but they got way more interesting in Angel Dust and King For a Day Fool For a Lifetime"
s7wkrf,"I turn off midlife crisis and Danzigs mother when playing San Andreas. so sick of those two songs always coming on lol. I enjoy FNM this is it compilation but really dislike Arabian disco. I respect pattons voice range but his voice is weird in that one. unless that was the first singer, still."
s7wkrf,Read somewhere years ago..a lot of less savvy metal and guitar rock fans wrote them off as a Christian rock band..simply through the fact they had ‚Äúfaith‚Äù in the band name.
s7wkrf,The Real Thing (song) is still in my top 10 songs of all time.  It is a brilliant ride.
s7wkrf,They have multiple platinum albums.
s7wkrf,Mike Parton is all I need in life
s7wkrf,"But he wasn‚Äôt the original singer, may he Rest In Peace :("
s7wkrf,"I like them a lot. Not one of my all time favorite bands, but all their stuff is pretty solid. 

Their live show is out of this world good. I've seen them 3x. They do not disappoint."
s7wkrf,"Loved Faith No More for a long time. Tried to see them in 1997, but couldn't convince my girlfriend at the time to go. We were even near the venue, but she wasn't having it. Then they broke up & I didn't get another chance until they reunited & toured behind Sol Invictus. I'd argue that's the best post-reunion album of any band & they were just as good live as I'd expected. Was really looking forward to seeing them again this year, but given the state of things I'm glad they cancelled their tours."
s7wkrf,"Completely agree. I went to Metallica/Guns N' Roses in Minneapolis back in '92 with FNM as the opener (apparently, Axl wanted Nirvana to open, but Cobain told 'em to fuck off). Needless to say, the audience was not very receptive to FNM.  I would put *Angeldust* in my top ten of the entire decade (ahead of *The Black Album* and *Use Your Illusion)*.  Start to finish, a masterpiece."
s7wkrf,"I feel like you are typing this out, while putting on a plastic suit, and chopping up your coworker."
s7wkrf,Just remember to never use a blow dryer after Mike patton‚Ä¶
s7wkrf,For new rock/metal based musicians that have a wide appreciation of music they are a huge influence. Particularly for composition and production they are a strong influence for me in getting ideas. Mike Patton is a definite hero vocally.
s7wkrf,Make Patton in general is underrated
s7wkrf,"Never thought if them as underrated. I feel as though they are regarded as iconic to most rock music enthusiasts. That being said, Angel Dust is a masterpiece in the genre of rock and does not even fit into a BS sub-genre which has been pervasive in rock music. It just fucking rocks."
s7wkrf,How old are you kid?
s7wkrf,I don‚Äôt think you know what underrated means. They were huge in the 90s
s7wkrf,No they weren‚Äôt! They were extremely popular during the grunge rock decade(s).
s7wkrf,The summer of ‚Äô92 I was working painting my grandpa‚Äôs fences over a long weekend and for some reason only brought the Angel Dust CD with me. I could have picked a lot worse albums to listen to non-stop for 3 days straight.
s7wkrf,Underrated?? We care a lot!
s7wkrf,Album of the Year should have had most songs on the radio.
s7wkrf,Take this bottle
s7wkrf,"YOU'RE PERFECT, YES IT'S TRUE"
s7wkrf,"I remember in the 1980s having a patch (used to cover torn pants) saying Faith No More.

I was like 6.

I had no idea what that was, and my English wasn't so good back then (I'm from Portugal).

But it's funny how a band name makes it into the textile world, to Portugal, and into the lives of people who have no clue."
s7wkrf,Angel Dust is still one of my favorite Albums
s7wkrf,Are you having a midlife crisis?
s7wkrf,Jizzlobber
s7wkrf,I swear I started reading your post and got it mixed up with Faith Plus One and thought why is this guy posting about South Park in this sub lol.
s7wkrf,I love FNM stuff from the 90‚Äôs. BUT I took an immediate dislike to MP when I saw that interview where he hangs shit on Wolfmother and carried on about what year it was. Fairly hypocritical when you consider one of FNM‚Äôs bigger hits was a Commodores COVER from 198fucking2.
s7wkrf,"Mike Patton is god, everything he touches turnes to gold!"
s7wkrf,Nah. They‚Äôre deserving of their unknowns. I saw them open for Metallica in LA in 88 or 89 and they got booed off stage.
s7wkrf,"Yeah, Red Hot Chili Peppers suck."
s7wkrf,FNM < RHCP
s7wkrf,Not sure id call them underrated when they still regularly headline some pretty big festivals lol
s7wkrf,Saw FNM when they toured on EPIC with Voivod and Soundgarden as the openers! They were AMAZING! Though Soundgarden was horrible. I haven‚Äôt been able to listen to them since. Though Cornell was one of the best‚Ä¶
s7wkrf,"I don't think FNM is underrated persay, but I don't think they're very interesting when it comes to Mike Patton. Hell, it barely sounds like something Mike Patton would even be associated with quite honestly. 

Mr. Bungle and Fantomas is Mike Patton."
s7wkrf,Dude. They cameo‚Äôd in Bill & Ted 2! (At least the lead guitarist did) How much bigger can you get?
s7wkrf,They were fucking awesome and fuck you for calling them underrated. What the fuck.
s7wkrf,Underrated? Been listening to them for years. All my mates like them too.
s7wkrf,So no under rated they're talked about weekly on this sub
s7wkrf,"What I have to say is;
We care ALOT!"
s7wkrf,Epic was everywhere what are you talkin about lol
s7wkrf,I inducted FNM into the Hall of Fame in my mind years ago.
s7wkrf,"You want it all, but you can‚Äôt have it"
s7wkrf,"King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime is easily in my Top 10 albums of all time."
s7wkrf,Definitely love this band!
s7wkrf,"I think they are fairly well known and listened too, i do hear their stuff on the radio fairly often for a 80s-90s band"
s7wkrf,I think they are rated.
s7wkrf,What about Faith Plus One?
s7wkrf,"Dude just because you just discovered them doesn't make them underrated. Faith no More was huge in the 90's, everyone in grunge/hard rock and metal circles loved them."
s7wkrf,"Before internet, i just heard the song and didn't have the tape. So until i looked up the lyrics recently, I thought he said ""GOD SAID, what is it""

&#x200B;

Turns out it was ""what is it? It's it"" and I feel strangely proud of my head canon version."
s7wkrf,"I actually popped onto this subreddit to make an FNM post, love their work, but have never listened to Sol Invictus. Going to give it a listen later.
FNM fans, what are you're thoughts on this album?"
s7wkrf,"Can‚Äôt say I entirely agree with them being classed as underrated, but can see your point that not enough credit from a mainstream perspective was given at the height of their powers. Angel Dust has to be the most perfect blend of FNM and Mr Bungle on an album I have ever heard."
s7wkrf,"They're not underated, they're wildly popular because they rock. Millions of fans would agree."
s7wkrf,Yes
s7wkrf,Some friends of mine opened for them in 1990. I was able to briefly meet them during load in and they all seemed like decent enough guys to me. I think they would have gotten even more of a spotlight had Nirvana not come onto the scene a year later. Followed by Pearl Jam and AIC.
s7wkrf,Underrated = Band I just heard of that's 40 yrs old.
s7wkrf,My buddy loved them but I didn‚Äôt like them at all.  It was on of the only bands where I didn‚Äôt like absolutely any of their stuff and i tried since he listened to it so godamn much. Funny how we technically hear the same thing but have completely different reactions to music like that.
s7wkrf,Hey look at! Me lady! I‚Äôm just a little baby! You‚Äôre lucky! To have me! I‚Äôm cute and sweet as candy!
s7wkrf,"I wouldn't consider FNM an underrated band as they were pretty big during the 90s. They get a lot of radio play on rock stations where I'm from and have headlined major festivals (particularly in US, UK and Australia). You probably don't hear much from them because they haven't released much in the 2000s until Sol Invictus in 2015, their first studio album in 18 years and as of now their most recent."
s7wkrf,"Glad you found then, but Michael Patton is not underatted. He got tons of cred. One might even craft an argument in favor of him being OVERatted"
s7wkrf,Epic just epic
s7wkrf,My favourite band ever!
s7wkrf,Loool underrated? Are you high or just too young to know better?
s7wkrf,Fuck well it's down the rabbit hole of FNM live videos for me now.
s7wkrf,"Got introduced to them in high school, seen them live so many times from open air festivals and indoor venues. Pattons voice is amazing, that vocal range... Their music was so progressive for their time, looking forward to next year's shows when they're back out."
s7wkrf,Underrated in the same way that the Beatles were underrated maybe. ie - not at all. Everyone loves FNM.
s7wkrf,Their cover of War Pigs is Epic
s7wkrf,39 yo must here. Faith no more are considered rock genius by musicians. They were huge in my generation!
s7wkrf,TIL - Courtney Love was in FNM for a few months before getting fired
s7wkrf,Faith+1 is the true class
s7wkrf,"Everything Mike Patton does, underrated. Faith No More ,Tomahawk, Mr Bungle, Fant√¥mas, Peeping Tom.... So much great music. Angel Dust is one of my favorite records."
s7wkrf,"Before it got canceled I had tix to see them do a arena tour of Australia, I wouldn‚Äôt call them underrated"
s7wkrf,Mr Bungle > Faith No More‚Ä¶. But I love all things Patton. He use to be a regular where I worked.
s7wkrf,I own their debut vinyl album on Mordham signed by everyone incl Chuck. It‚Äôs a personal favorite of the period.
s7wkrf,How did you come this conclusion? FNM and Mike Patton are huge.
s7wkrf,"the completely sold out the reunion tour a few years back in a matter of minuettes. never been under rated, maybe not your main stream MJ popular, but indeed a huge recognized part of music culture and the growth of rock."
s7wkrf,Easily my favourite international band (I'm in Australia). I still remember clearly the day I bought The Real Thing CD and that started the journey for me. When they toured here a year or 2 later I went to both their shows in Sydney. During the show in Wollongong Mike jumped off the stage and noone apart from me seemed to notice. I ran up to him while he ran thru the crowd and gave him a massive hug. Angeldust is a masterpiece of experimental metal/pop and Mike's melodies are killer. I read he's having some health issues of late.
s7wkrf,"FNM > RHCP
Fuck Anthony Kiedis. If you know the story behind this then you know FNM would've been an even bigger band."
s7wkrf,"Faith No More with Mike Patton is not underrated. HOWEVER, as I go through this thread I realize that the Chuck Mosley version of the band is probably underrated, as no one has mentioned them (though I admit I haven‚Äôt gone through all 200+ comments).

To be honest, this is my fave version of the band, even though they had two albums. Introduce Yourself is a fun punk album with some weird but wonderful tracks. I felt they became just another hard rock/metal band after that."
s7wkrf,"Mike Patton can really belt out his songs, ever listen to mr bungle?"
s7wkrf,"The Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center will be established sometime in the near future by Sir James Martin, and it shall be Excellent

[The Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center ](https://m.facebook.com/FaithNoMoreSpiritualandTheologicalCenter/)"
s7wkrf,"Google ‚ÄúNone of Them Knew They Were Robots‚Äù, fan made video.  Thank me later.

The fan made Mr. Bungle vids I‚Äôve seen are unlike anything I can describe, straight out of another universe."
s7wkrf,Isn't that the dude from Mr. Bungle?
s7wkrf,"Thinking of an alternative universe where Courtney Love never left FNM.

shudders"
s7wkrf,They opened for Billy idol in '91/tampa. Sang the nestle crunch commercial üòÜ it definitely was a fun show.
s7wkrf,I‚Äôve never forgiven them for their horrendous version of ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù
s7wkrf,Shit show live however. I actually left it was so bad‚Ä¶
s7wkrf,"Angel Dust is one of the few albums I consider to be absolutely perfect front to back, and Mike Patton is definitely the best frontman that ever existed. Arguably the best singer ever, and one of the greatest musical visionaries that ever existed... Mr Bungle was my intro to him. Discovered FNM after, lol. FNM wre fucking HUGE influencers and musical innovators"
s7wkrf,"The front man of the Red Hot Chili Peppers always hated Faith No More. He always accused them of steal their style which he believes the chili peppers cultivated over a decade before faith no more's popularity.

Infact there is at least one instance of Anthony Kiedis stopping Faith No More from performing at a venue, threatening to boycott said venue if they ever did.

I imagine the producers of RHCP and AK stifled Faith No More's rise on more than one occasion."
s7wkrf,"I saw them play as a teenager, by chance (a friend won free tickets) Angel Dust tour...and met a couple of them, also by chance.

I didn't know them at all except 'Epic' and 'be aggressive.'

I was randomly hanging about with a couple of friends in a carpark in my city, as you do when you're 15.

A couple of American guys came up to us and asked if we knew where to score some weed, I said ""oh, I have some in my bag"" and we had a smoke in the carpark.

I noticed that one of my friends was acting strange and had gone very quiet and nervous, the guys said ""thanks"" and left and she said ""oh my god, do you know who they were!?"" 
I replied that I didn't.

Apparently they were members of FNM (it was not Mike Patton, I would have recognised him from the videos.)

As far as I was concerned they were random American visitors, we lived in a pretty international city so it wasn't unusual to meet people from around the world.

I went to see them play the next night, It was great...but I've never got into listening to them that much, maybe it's time to start...29 years after seeing them live, and sharing my weed with a couple of them! ü§£"
s7wkrf,"Coming from someone who graduated Highschool in 1997, I can assure you FNM received plenty of credit for their music. Personally, I can't stand Faith no More. They gave off a distinct ""rock star vibe"" (black leather jackets and sunglasses) during the grunge era. Grunge bands were anti hair metal and FNM was a bridge to an earlier time where bananas were stuffed down tight jeans and bandanas were tied to microphone stands. They suck."
s8iaql,"Adam, you sing like an angel, very nice rendition."
s8iaql,Nailed the spirit of the song with one voice and one guitar.
s8iaql,Perfection. Perfect range for the song and perfect pitch demonstrated.
s8iaql,"I knew him before he was famous, fellas. \*Sweating profusely\* \*Now looking around the room\* I see a Doritos chip on the floor in the middle of the salla, and the only question I have for myself is if I'm feeling lucky. Well do I, punk. Do I... My dog then walks in the room and eats the Dorito. Now, let's just forget about this, but you can't. I wonder how my music reputation is going to recover from this kind of publicity. Luckily for me, I have a Subreddit where I discuss about r/musicbranding for the serious musicians. Batteries not included, prices may vary."
s8iaql,"Heh, [the time that Bryan Wilson forgot he was on Full House](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2zmbsv/i_am_brian_wilson_cofounder_of_the_beach_boys_amaa/cpka2ao/?context=3)..."
s7n9h2,"Short article.  IIRC, it actually took years and the help of a top producer to hit it's iconic stride.  So glad they didn't give up."
s7n9h2,"So wierd but cool to hear a classic before it became the song we all know.

TBH the original sounds like a terrible off-key version of Take on Me

Glad they changed/fixed it."
s7n9h2,"The Weeknd's Blinding Lights comes to my mind every time I hear Take On Me, I can't unhear the similarities between the two songs."
s7n9h2,At 15 as well pretty impressive
s7n9h2,"A-ha is one of the most underrated bands of the 80s, and are still making great music (that's largely unknown outside of Norway).

Their MTV Unplugged performance a few years back was excellent."
s7n9h2,"On their MTV unplugged Aha do a cover of Bridges ""Socks of the Fox"". They absolutely seem like an average pub band without Morten Harket's voice. To the point that they even seem to be making the same pub band mistake of being in a desperate hurry to rush through their own song."
s7n9h2,Try their other 'hit' The Sun Always Shines On TV
s7n9h2,Like witnessing fruit ripen.
s7n9h2,This is really cool. I love learning about the backstories behind popular songs.
s7n9h2,"Everyone should, at least, try to write a song. You don't really understand music unless you do."
s7n9h2,You can hear the germ of a really great song. And the paring away of  too many ideas helps. There are some good musicians trying to do too much just because they could. But the new singer on the Aha version really makes it great.
s7n9h2,That was very cool. Thank you u/AltruiSisu!
s7n9h2,I definitely didn‚Äôt expect an early 1960s surf rock/Asian fusion verging on proto-ska version of that song.
s7n9h2,"[There were actually many more versions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsFoiEZBtBM8wq31TVUPctvTJj-FfAjNX) between this and the final version. The original take was also originally based off a Juicy Fruit ad so I‚Äôve been trying to find it. The first video in this playlist is my best guess, it was apparently playing on Swedish television in the 1980s so I would imagine it could have been playing in Norway too. Plus parts of the rhythm do sound a little familiar."
s7n9h2,"This is awesome, thank you so much!"
s7n9h2,Whoa--had no idea. Thanks for posting!
s7n9h2,This shows what a good producer can do with a song. In this case Alan Tarney who had previously had produced hits for Cliff Richard and a few other more established artists.
s7n9h2,"Ellie‚Äôs version of this song in The Last of Us part 2 is incredible. I love the original but her version really is beautiful, just wish it was out there in the wild to listen too"
s7n9h2,This song always gets me wanting to dance.
s7n9h2,r/songbirth might like this.
s7n9h2,Then synthesizers took over and it was a wrap
s7n9h2,"The kind of content I'm subscribed to this sub, thanks !"
s7n9h2,I was so disappointed that they blatantly ripped this song off till i read the article.
s7n9h2,Wow. I like this one better
s7n9h2,Musically I like the original more. However those vocals leave a lot to be desired.
s7n9h2,That was cool. I never knew that.
s7n9h2,"They were the first concert I ever went to, in Germany in 1986. I‚Äôm going to see them at Radio City in a few months if the plague subsides. I‚Äôm really excited about it."
s7n9h2,"It‚Äôs more like the Reel Big Fish cover

[here](https://youtu.be/QHpU0ZfXZ_g)"
s7n9h2,The original mumble rapper?
s7n9h2,"Cool. I just read about the existence of this a few days ago. That said, I really dislike the mix on this. Whoever did the recording and mixing has the vocals way too hot relative to the music."
s7n9h2,That style of the logo on the label matches the video too.
s7n9h2,"There were also two versions of Take On Me. The 1984 version and the version that made it big in 1985. They are already very similar compared to what OP posted.

Arguably one of the best songs ever."
s7n9h2,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Hunting High and Low came out in '85, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Morten has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor."
s7n9h2,"I don't know a lot about music history etc, but when I read something like this I always love it.  Thanks :)"
s8m9ei, Damnn this track will always be a banger
s8n49k,"In no way am I attempting to sell his music, if someone likes a piece he has told me if they ask he will allow them to perform it for free as long as they like, he simply want's people to enjoy his music, simple as that, no hidden strings or caveats."

s8lxkd,"Depending on how old they are, some of this music could be extremely old to them, more than twice their lifetime ago"
s8lxkd,"Some people are just caught up in their own little worlds.

A few years ago I was talking with a girl and had music playing in the background. She asked who it was. I said it was U2. She claimed to have never heard of them. I then sarcastically said they were a small Irish band. She was like ""Oh, cool. The only Irish band I listen to is Flogging Molly."" Well, I wouldn't consider them to be an Irish band but I was more confounded that she knew Flogging Molly but not U2. Like, how does that happen? That's like saying you've never heard of Alfred Hitchcock but do know, say, Robert Rossen. I couldn't wrap my head around it."
s8lxkd,"Play Greta Van Fleet and tell your friend it is Led Zeppelin. 

God I have an unhealthy amount of hate for Great Van Fleet, they suck so hard."
s8lxkd,"Some people just don't get into music. Music is really personal and subjective.

 In my experience, low intellect and insecure people tend to use music as a form of social relating and cohesion or tribalism. They have no taste, bc you can't follow the crowd and maintain your own opinion. They are the ones who will say thing like, 'oh listening to x means you are y.' 

Ignore that noise and turn the volume up on the tunes :)"
s8lxkd,"If I mention Elvis, The Beatles, or Led Zeppelin, and my friend has never heard of each of them - he is no longer my friend.   


I can‚Äôt live my life like that."
s8lxkd,It‚Äôs your duty to pull the wool from his eyes.
s8lxkd,"I'm turning 30 this year and will soon start a family.  I swear my kids are going to grow up listening to what today is known as ""classic rock."" It's kinda sad.  They'll be listening to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Boston, Queen, Motorhead, ACDC, etc.  That music will never die or go away. It's too powerful and influential.  School of Rock should be a mandatory watch in music class \*in my opinion.\* Lol"
s8lxkd,"I‚Äôve had friends even in high school whose parents kept a pretty tight watch over what they saw and listened to‚Ä¶ some people are only exposed to a very small variety of music and entertainment.

My first GF had never heard of most of the bands I liked‚Ä¶ her parents sheltered her and were pretty out of touch with music in general.  When they drove her somewhere they only listened to Oldie music on the radio.  Her most ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù music were a few CDs that friends gave her, which she hid from her parents because they wouldn‚Äôt approve.  Like old Prince CDs and one Metallica album."
s8lxkd,"I wouldn't be able to wrap my head around that either. Hell my 9 year old daughter wears Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Rolling Stones and others tshirts to school and she knows who all of them are. I don't even listen to that much of any of them at home. I can't believe people could live 20 years and never hear of any of them."
s8lxkd,"In my Youtube playlist, there are many tracks where the comments are ""<Insert Netflix show> bought me here."" To me, these aren't obscure tracks. And if youre not familiar with the popular tracks, you may not be familiar with the band. Led Zepellin famously didnt licence any of their songs to Guitar Hero and I dont recall (off the top of my head) their tracks being featured on any recent Films/Shows. If your friends parents arent introducing them to music (which they absolutely should, btw) Im not sure where you would hear Zeppelin nowadays. Nirvana have a bit more exposure."
s8lxkd,"This reminds me of when I was out shopping one day and noticed this great blues rock coming from a small radio behind the cash register. When I went up to pay for my stuff, I mentioned that I liked the music and wondered who it was. The lady looked at me like I was crazy, ""THE ROLLING STONES! YOU DON'T KNOW THE ROLLING STONES?!"" I know the Stones, but just their radio stuff. I've never listened to an album of theirs, except Voodoo Lounge which I won from a radio contest. I was always more of a Beatles guy than Stones. We all have blind spots."
s8lxkd,Wait till they hear of The Knack and The Bay City Rollers
s8lxkd,"I don't know how old you are, but it sounds like you're a school aged kid and your friend is also a school aged kid.

If so, this is normal. Not everyone has the same interests and you only have a few years of total time banked developing legitimate interests in the first place."

s8l4u8,"Take a look at the albums released in 1969. Which of those still interest you? How about all of the people who covered the Beatles hoping some of the magic would rub off on them? Have you listened to Jim Nabors recently?

Only the best, truly original stuff will still be listened to. And I find that is a tiny fraction of what's on the top 40, or hot 100, or whatever. You have to search outside of the most popular pop music- which is mostly derivative- and once you do, you'll find some amazing things. they may have small audiences but for instance I still listen to post-punk released in the 70s the general public has no idea about. Does that meet your criteria for ""people?"""
s8l4u8,"Mariah Carey's - All I Want for Christmas Is You

People love Christmas songs."
s8l4u8,"You can consider the writers of today's pop songs, the equivalent of those artists, since they perform too and playing a song by The Beatles or The rolling stones isn't that much of an achievement. Besides those weren't even the interesting songwriters of the time.

Besides, you don't need good music to stay, you just need to match the basic energy of the audience, if you go too specific the song will die when the context does."
s8l4u8,"From the female mainstream side, probably Sia, Adelle, and Lady Gaga.  They all kinda wedge their hits in from around late 2000s to current.  I'd expect them to get play on an oldies station on the regular in 30 year."

Their album Uplifter sucks so bad

So those plus Waiting and Solar Flare"
s86p55,lift yourself is great.
s86p55,Animal Collective already did it for us. It's called Dansee Manatee.
s86p55,Cringe
s8fgz9,Just love that one! Silverchair it's such a good band bc they made their name into the grunge but kept their unique essence which it's great imo
s8nqa6,"This is an argument as old as, well, music. 

With that in mind, the answer is ""no""."
s8nqa6,"I think new music is killing new music. 

I don't have any stats at hand, but:  I listen to a lot of new music. The thing is, it is very niche.  My regard for the most popular music has only been on a decline, and it feels like it is accelerating. It's been a couple of years since I've heard something filter down from the most popular stuff and I've thought ""that's catchy."""
s8nqa6,"There's more and more of a niche for every flavor , and places to find it so maybe in the mainstream sense music is dying but since everyone has a place to go where they didn't before I think that may be the contributing factor to what looks like falling and failing industry"
s8nqa6,[No](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)
s8nqa6,"A majority of people that exclusively listen to ""old"" (60s/70s) music and say modern music is trash limit themselves to really popular artists, so labels feel the need to reissue that stuff endlessly.  Led Zeppelin compilation/reissue #1,000"
s8nqa6,"Is Old Music Killing New Music?

No. Music is music, and 'new vs old' is an age-old theme. There is no 'crisis,' any more than there was when opera, jazz, swing, R&B, pop, rock n' roll, acoustic rock, country fusion, new wave, electronic, hip-hop, etc, etc happened. They're ALL still alive and healthy. 

There's no crisis, just younger people whining about older people (and vice-versa)."
s8nqa6,"if the only metric we're defining ""killing"" as is how much money is being made, which sure isn't the worst metric to gauge something, then yeah i think it makes perfect sense. younger generations don't buy music. buying an album and a physical copy of music is something that gen x and older are used to. also younger generations consume their music in a multitude of different ways that's probably not currently easily to quantify.

another big problem is that now days there are sooo many more musicians and artists. music is more saturated than ever. it makes sense there's a few dozen titans of old music simply because there weren't nearly as many musicians back then. certainly not ones with the capability and access to make quality sounding recordings, which now can be easily done from the comfort of ones bedroom. so the people who got in back then are basically set because they had the benefit of being the only game in town for decades.

right now music, for the musician, is less profitable than ever. streaming services pay dog shit to the 99% of artists on the platform and music labels are still taking advantage of it's talent. most new comers are all DIY and independent, which again means a lot less money. all that to say that just because new music isn't as profitable as old music, for a multitude of reasons, doesn't mean that people aren't listening to or enjoying new music more. i think it's just spread far more thinly. there might always been only a handful of big pop stars at any given time, but now there are millions of indie artists who's music is easily accessible online to people and i think now instead of all the listens being funneled only to the top pop stars that now people are also listening to a lot more unknown artists. the pop stars might still get most of the pie, but there are more and more crumbs for everyone else.

that's my hypothesis anyways."
s8nqa6,Are they really blaming old good music for new music being trash?
s8nqa6,Hopefully
s8nqa6,"Good, awards are fake anyway.

We paid to have it played millions of times and now it's the best album of the year! 

Buy this shit, please. We need more yachts."
s8nqa6,"> A decade ago, 40 million people watched the Grammy Awards. That‚Äôs a meaningful audience, but now the devoted fans of this event are starting to resemble a tiny subculture.

Failing to account for the enormous drop in cable subscribers.  Of course viewership is massively down for this reason.  Add to this all the other things to do vs watching a boring live self aggrandizing event."
s8nqa6,The Grammys are awful.  They don‚Äôt reward talent.  It‚Äôs a big pay for play PR stunt.  That‚Äôs why nobody watches it.
s8nqa6,Let's hope so...
s8nqa6,New music is killing music in general lmao
s8nqa6,"This article is seems to conflate inability for large labels to profit off new music with new music being killed off. Musicians no longer need to a major label to get their music out there and consumers no longer need labels to tell them what to listen to. Entire genre's (vaporwave for example) are created without ever having to be approved by someone.  The labels haven't changed their business models enough to accommodate this. He cites poor grammy viewership as evidence of decline in new music appreciation, yet the oscars saw record low viewership as well. People have just woken up to the fact that award shows are shams, and all in all a terrible way to spend 3 hours. 

And of course someone is going to pay Bob Dylan hundred of millions of dollars for his catalogue. It doesn't matter if it is 1963 or 2053, somewhere out there is a college kid who has just lit up a joint and hit play on Freewheelin'."
s8nqa6,"Graph is irrelevant, shows how the Grammy's are deteriorating not new music"
s8nqa6,"New music isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúDead‚Äù by any means. I listen to lots of music new and old, and I have really enjoyed lots of recent releases.

That article mentions the Grammys a lot as a reason for new music being ‚Äúkilled‚Äù, But even as someone who listens to lots of new music, I could care less about the Grammys, because my favorite new artists rarely get nominated or perform there. It‚Äôs basically just a popularity contest, not a real evaluation of quality music in my opinion.

Also, there is so much more new music than ever before, so it makes sense the ‚Äútop hits‚Äù don‚Äôt make up as high a streaming percentage, because there is just more variety and places for people to go for their music. This is just a classic old man yelling at the clouds about how ‚Äúmusic today just isn‚Äôt the same‚Äù"
s8nqa6,"I think there are many parts to this problem:

The problem of too many options - there is a known psychological paradox of choice in which human beings are actually happier when choosing between fewer options than having to pick between every option imaginable. Back on the pre-internet days you could only discover new music through a few places (TV, radio, a friend, etc). And putting your music out was also generally more difficult. Nowadays it is both much easier to listen to all music ever made as well as  to record at home at distribute your own music. This has its upsides but also can be extremely overwhelming for a listener. With so many options so easily available most of us find it easier to engage with what you already know. Even if you take the time to listen to something new you never get to develop a real relationship and familiarity with that music since there are 1000+ new things to check out after that. 

The problem of curation - this is related to issue above. When you could only discover new music through a few number of ways, that meant that much of that music had to be curated by someone else who‚Äôs also music fan. That could be a radio DJ, the owner of your local record store, a TV show presenter, a trusted friend‚Ä¶ now curation has its own problems. Many people complain about overlooked artists, etc. But I do think curation is underrated because not everyone is a ‚Äúmusic person.‚Äù Most people will just listen whatever you feed them. Yes, they have some general sense of their preferences but these are often rooted on some vague sense of familiarity. Music fans like (I assume) most people in this sub, scrutinize music to much higher degree. We obsess over subtleties, we over analyze little details, we develop much more intimate relationships with these works of art. I think it is helpful to have access to curation from an equally devoted fan. The TikTok algorithm of the auto generated Spotify playlist is not gonna cater to my tastes. Sometimes good music is ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù And those algorithmic music discovery sites of today are geared towards the kind of casual listener that is not gonna consume anything remotely ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù 

The problem of innovation - this is more speculative, but when you look at the history of music the great pivotal moments  in which a new generation of artists emerged it was often paired with evolutions in music making technology. Think of the Beatles and multi-track recording. Distortion and it‚Äôs role in hard rock / metal. Synthesizers and Post-Punk/New Wave. Sampling technology and hip-hop, etc ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible we have simply reached a technological plateau in music. Digital Audio Workstations and auto-tune are perhaps the last true tech innovations in music (that I know of) and those are at least a couple of decades old. This is not to say there is no unique truly original music out there, but it was much easier to be truly revolutionary in the past when you‚Äôre using tools that had never been used before. Today you may create something unique but it often feels like re-shuffling/recombining things that were done before in a slightly different way. That means you have perhaps many good artists out there but few ‚Äútruly great‚Äù ones. Also there is a lack of new ‚Äúmovements‚Äù in music, in which artists independently or together tried to push towards a very specific new direction."

s6v971,I assume that maybe Travis‚Äô team have made an effort to ensure that the media is saturated with non-Astroworld related news. He‚Äôs made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want to dwell on it and take responsibility.
s6v971,"If by ""Media"" you're talking about news channels/websites then yes ofc they moved on, doing articles on a 2 month old event isn't very common when they're focused on not going out of business every day

If by ""Media"" you mean SOCIAL media, people are still definitely talking about it"
s6v971,Why is nobody trying to hold LiveNation accountable? They were the folks responsible for managing crowd safety and royally fucked up. No fan of Travis Scott but the absolute focus on him among all the responsible people is pretty weird.
s6v971,"I mean, if Chris Brown is still around after beating the shit out of Rihanna, then it‚Äôs not that big a leap to see Travis Scott still around.  I don‚Äôt know how or why it‚Äôs decided some people stay or get ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù, but it seems to be a conscious decision."
s6v971,"Media displays recent news first instead of bringing up the same story for months.

More news at 11:00"
s6v971,"Yes, that's how the media works. They report on current events, not things that happened two months ago."
s6v971,No shit
s6v971,"I use DuckDuckGo and after the standard bio links at the top (wikipedia, his social media links) it's all AstroWorld related. Of course if you search in the News tab, you get the same links you do because those are the most recent headlines, not events from two months ago. You know, that's why it's called *new*s and not *old*s"
s6v971,Welcome to the 24 hour news cycle
s6v971,"You know all of these media companies are mostly owned by the same people who also own Travis Scott's Media Presence?

Travis Scott is not a musician as much as he's a product and they've invested a lot of money in that product so they're not just going to let it go away. 

So the people who spend a lot of money on Travis Scott are going to keep spending money to keep him publicly known. The media and the people who are trying to promote Travis Scott are not two separate things.

Do you ever watch the local news and they have an segment about a new TV show or Big Sale coming out? They didn't put that in there because they thought it was newsworthy they put that in there because that's part of the deal. They're owned by the people who own that TV show and they've got to promote it.

Also, OP, you're looking at the top stories recent news tab so of course it's not going to show you anything but articles from within the last 48 hours. It'd be like clicking on the trending page of Twitter and getting mad that people aren't talking about the Armenian Genocide. People should be talking about the Armenian Genocide but I don't expect it to be the front page of everything all the time."
s6v971,"uh

yea, no shit

it's not in the media's best interest to keep repeating the same news story over and over again

it's not like he's safe from the lawsuit just because the media isn't covering it

if something happens regarding it they'll talk about it, if not then they won't, it's that simple

do you expect them to just keep reminding people, regularly, that x event happened?"
s6v971,OP acting like this is unique to this specific tragic event...
s6v971,I hope you realize Google filters results and shows you what they want you to see. A Google search does not represent society.
s6v971,"It's news. Keyword is NEW. Timeliness is importabt. If you google Germany, the top news isn't the holocaust."
s6v971,And what do you expect?
s6v971,This is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how Google and their Top Stories section works.
s6v971,"Imagine if a bunch of deaths happened at some reddit group like Tenacious D‚Äôs concert.

This sub would have pinned post about how the tragedy is too sad and should never be posted about again in honor of the dead"
s6v971,Because ultimately it's not his fault and much more blame should be put on LiveNation...
s6v971,"Is it ""the media"" or is it search engines optimizing profits?"
s6v971,"I Googled him and it's all Kanye thanking him for some reason and a TMZ article about him at the Rams Cards game and having a sewage pipe burst next to him, [which I find funny](https://imgur.com/KsURS1z)

Also what else are news sites supposed to report on him about? The legal system is slow. There's nothing to report on that front so they have to get clicks somehow"
s6v971,Bruh there‚Äôs a genocide happening in China and no one talks about it and very few people even give a shit. This is how people work
s6v971,Don't just blame the media. The PEOPLE decide to support him or not. They are reporting on people enabling him.
s6v971,"The Astroworld shit is fucked, but as someone who is neither a fan of Scott or his music, why is there such fixation on this? It‚Äôs tragic and extremely sad when examined under a microscope, but considering that this will likely pave the way for tragedies like this to be avoided in the future: what‚Äôs done it done and there really wasn‚Äôt much that he could do in the first place."
s6v971,"Do you understand how media works? The news cycle moves on, what did you expect?

Why do expect something different for this particular incident?"
s6v971,"The devil works hard, Kris Jenner works harder."
s6v971,[oh no](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/881/867/6f6.jpg)
s6v971,"I mean it happened two months ago. I guarantee if you google Snoop Dogg you‚Äôll find whatever he‚Äôs been doing recently and not the fact that he was on trial for murder in the 90‚Äôs. While it‚Äôs obviously a longer time period since, news comes and goes quickly on the internet and I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre surprised that they‚Äôve moved on."
s6v971,"Ok I'm gonna get flak for this but why don't we hold the venue, security, event management, and everyone else accountable?

Why are we blaming the performer? It was a festival. He wasn't even the only performer.

His job is to perform. There are people who's responsibility is to ensure these things don't happen. It's not like this hasn't happened before.

I really feel like the blame is being unfairly shifted from the venue and management onto the performer."
s6v971,"A man ran over 50 or so people at a parade a month ago, and that story is just completely gone from the public mind. It‚Äôs always just fake outrage - on the the next."
s6v971,Maybe most people just don‚Äôt agree that it was his fault.  People have been getting trampled at concerts for decades.  Never have I seen such a movement to blame the act on stage for it all.
s6v971,"The media? What the fuck?

Y‚Äôall have excuses for everything. There‚Äôs nothing new in the story, why would there be new news stories on the Astroworld tragedy?

You blame the media for *everything*. This has nothing to do with the media. They report current events. This isn‚Äôt current. Want to keep it current - make it current somehow. Get the media personalities you suck off to say something, somehow generate some new news. It has nothing to do with the media. There‚Äôs no new news, so there‚Äôs nothing to report. They reported on Travis Scott‚Äôs current events. Make the whole thing a current event - Go protest Live Nation or his concerts or the fucking Kardashians. They‚Äôre not going to make up news. Fucking idiots."
s6v971,"Yeah that‚Äôs how humanity works lol, we stumble from one abomination to the next"
s6v971,Y‚Äôall need to read the r/KUWTK sub more. Pete and Kim were clocked as a distraction from the beginning. üòÇ
s6v971,There is so much happening of course it is it's irrelevant now with everything else. You can't keep one thing a tive indefinitly
s6v971,I was just thinking yesterday how all that has died down.
s6v971,So what? Are they supposed to talk about it every day for the rest of eternity? It's not top news anymore. Legal battles will occur outside the public eye. The vast majority of people don't care about Astroworld anymore. Life goes on.
s6v971,What more is there to do? Do you expect these tabloid news sites to just keep writing about the same thing for months on end? What happened at Astroworld was awful and I hope those responsible are being held accountable but writing the same story over and over doesn't get clicks.
s6v971,Fuk that loser . He not even a good rapper. So generic
s6v971,"I mean, what do you expect? Terrible events and bad news are a dime a dozen and it‚Äôs in our nature to move on and be desensitized the further our cognitive distance is."
s6v971,"Ok, and? Like it's Travis himself killed those people, lol. What will Travis do if his fans are wild animals who can't control themselves? You say there were children who died and so on... But what normal parent will bring their child to this kind of concert? It's not for children, there are a lot of songs with curse words. Anyway, I'm waiting for an album, it sounds promising."
s6v971,"""media"" isn't some sort of sentient being."
s6v971,People forgot about what The Who and The Rolling Stones did too. Google them.
s6v971,The world still buys Chris Brown's shit for whatever reason.
s6v971,It helps that he also would help people when he saw them and that he isnt responsible live nation is (fuck live nation) he wont have to pay anything since he isnt at fault (Congress even said it)
s6v971,"Nobody cares because... its not really his fault.

I mean, sure, he's definitely at fault indirectly  with how he ran that festival.

But guess what? His fans don't exactly care either. Fans are too much fanboys/fangirls to ever give up on their fanboyism. 

Redditors still LOVE their metal bands, beatles, etc even though we know by now how many of them are closeted pedos, wife/gf beaters, etc"
s6v971,try looking up 'Astroworld' you get plenty of articles on the ongoing lawsuits and investigation. Although Travis's name is plastered all over the headlines and festival he himself had very little to do with the safety failings of that event.
s6v971,Are you supposed to blame him for venue security not securing the place?
s6v971,Shit it happened gotta move forward with life
s6v971,"There is something call ORM (Online Reputation Management) where you can pay an agency to clean up the search results when people search your name in search engines. 

Its very common these days. Celebrities, politicians and businesses do it all the time."
s6v971,"If took how long to bring R Kelley down? Even after the video of him propositioning during a concert in Ethiopia ‚Äúdo you have your shots?? Do you have a visa??‚Äù 
  
And Chris Brown still has a career, with Rihana actually bad mouthing Chris browns ex after continuing to work with Chris brown. 
  
Not surprised at all with Travis Scott. My money is he‚Äôll have a viral collaboration with Ticketmaster + McDonald‚Äôs in a year or two."
s6v971,"I mean...duh. the media only cares what gets them clicks. The same story only gets clicks for so long. They're businesses, not activists."
s6v971,Yet no one remembers the venue promoters or cops who did nothing and flayed on everything. Stop with the manufacturer outrage it‚Äôs so tired
s6v971,"What do you want the media to do (asking sincerely)? Are there new things to report? Has something notable occurred? 

I‚Äôm not being dismissive of the fact that people lost their lives. It is a terrible tragedy and those who lost loved ones will be forever impacted. That concert is probably on their minds every day as it should be. But not sure what you want the media to do."
s6v971,[looks like the FBI is on it ](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fbi-website-astroworld-1285078/)
s6v971,I became a TS fan because of all the hype.
s6v971,He is spending some big $$$$ to change the algorithm.
s6v971,He looks like that mfer with that wide-ass neck everyone was posting
s6v971,"I hate it. 

I hate him and I hate it."
s6v971,"Who gives a shit, the legal stuff is being worked out. People will be held responsible. It's not your job to worry all the time."
s6v971,"Except for the fans that died, none of his fans really care. 

Now, if it had been policemen who'd killed those kids, holy crap, they'd be out for blood. Since it was other fans, nobody cares.

More deaths to come I guess. You'd have to be a special kind of stupidity to go to the next one, but it will be full."
s6v971,I‚Äôd call that willful ignorance.
s6v971,Why is everyone acting like this is the first time this shit happened and like Travis Scott is a fucking super villian.
s6v971,SEO / Digital Content firms specialize in doing things like this.
s6v971,Social media has destroyed our collective attention span and our processes of evaluating famous people
s6v971,"Does it help if there are Reddit comments that mention Travis Scott contributed to the death of 10 people?

Would it be useful to boost articles about how 10 people died at a Travis Scott concert, [like this one from The Guardian](https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/16/astroworld-festival-deaths-ruled-accidental)?

Is linking him with the tragic and preventable deaths of ten people at Astroworld something that Travis Scott wants to avoid?"
s6v971,There should be a copy/paste about Astroworld similar to the one we post every time Chris Brown is mentioned.
s6v971,Pepperidge Farm Remembers.
s6v971,"Three months ago, I didn't know who Travis Scott even was..."
s6v971,"Well, he said sorry.../s"
s6v971,"Yup. This is classic PR scrubbing by pumping any and every bit of ""news"" possible to drown out anything about  ""the incident"" in algorithms."
s6v971,"Its because if you have lots of fucking money, you can buy public opinion."
s6v971,This isn‚Äôt the media forgot. There are companies you can pay to make things on the internet about you incredibly hard to find. It‚Äôs called cleaning your online profile or something like that
s6v971,Not media forgetting. It‚Äôs money changing SEO
s6v971,"His PR team are actively trying to push down negative results, there is a whole industry dedicated to it. In the end if people don‚Äôt agree with his actions maybe they shouldn‚Äôt give him money or attention. It all starts with people, reality is people don‚Äôt care beyond the immediate."
s6v971,Are you surprised. Even the biggest news stories are only relevant for a couple weeks.
s6v971,Try duckduckgo.com.   it's all still about his concert and the lawsuits.
s6v971,Or like that one time Justin Bieber ran over someone
s6v971,Demonic
s6v971,"Gee, I wonder why Kim started dating Pete Davidson right after Astroworld? Nice distraction."
s6v971,Idk about other people but I'm planning on buying an astroworld aliexpress hoodie to keep that headline alive. It is quite crisp
s6v971,I was starting to think I was the only one who still remembers he's liable for the death of several people
s6v971,Weeell Google isn't Wikipedia and news usually talk about new stuff. Not sure why you'd expect the top results on Google to be a two month old story.
s6v971,It works every time. Just wait and if that doesnt help just bury it üòÇ
s6v971,Whatever man society is so messed up. It's common knowledge that if you're famous then you can do anything and people will still worship you. We just have to accept that a significant percent of the population lacks any real moral compass.
s6v971,That's why I just laughed to myself when people were suggesting he'd be cancelled or go bankrupt over it. Within a week it was pretty much done.
s6v971,The promoters of the concert who cut costs are more to blame than Travis.
s6v971,"Why are people still blaming Travis Scott and not the promoter and logistics team of the festival?

Everyone should be aware that Travis Scott doesn't personally hire the security. He's a performer who leases his likeness."
s6v971,"..okay?

it's not like fuckin 9/11"
s6v971,"Don't ever expect those pitiful sites to ever do anything except post whatever makes them money, and never expect them to have any moral standards. And don't expect their regular readers to have any common sense either"
s6v971,Boo hoo
s6v971,Travis will be fine.
s6v971,Wait what are utopia headphones?
s6v971,"It's SEO, Search Engine Optimization.  Every popular entity has professionals that do this."
s6v971,"I wish some of you would stop pretending to care about Astroworld or the late victims' lives as a way to bash hip-hop. It's pretty well-known how this sub rolls when it comes to any genre outside of rock.

If you want to make micro-aggressive posts or declare your dislike for the genre or the artist, please do and say it with your chest. It's so tacky and childish the way you guys behave."
s6v971,"I work at a record store, and the kids who listen to and buy his music never stopped.

Scott deserves comeuppance, but, unless the victims' families have one hell of a lawyer, it unfortunately ain't happening."
s6v971,"That‚Äôs because news runs in cycles and only cares about clicks, your not reading the news, you are reading an article that works best for advertising money/click generation. Advertising is the biggest problem in the world right now because of situations like this."
s6v971,Don‚Äôt use Gooooogle.  Results are skewed in Goooogle.
s6v971,Who cares? He and live nation are about to be sued into oblivion.
s6v971,"The FBI is conducting an investigation. This dude, Live Nation and I believe the venue all have a string of lawsuits. This was reported on yesterday. No one forgot. This is what I would expect his PR team to be working on publicly, two months later. Good news only"
s6v971,The first 2-3 results on Google are ALWAYS paid spots. This propably showed up before and if it didn't then they specifically bought those spots to hide the real thing people online are talking about with this guy.
s6v971,Gross. I blocked him from ever being played on my Spotify. Least I could do
s6v971,"Almost like normal people don‚Äôt carry around irrational hate boners like your average redditor. 

Oh no Travis Scott isn‚Äôt being hated enough, how ever will we survive. üò•"
s6v971,"Lol OP still mad at Travis Scott lmao

Old news"
s6v971,"There is whole companies that get rid of bad searches for Google, he has all the money in the world so surely he is getting rid of all negative media. Just a few days ago it was on the news that the FBI wanted pics on Astroworld and that's not even on the news showcased on the Google search.

The public can't let themselves forget about Travis Scott and Astroworld. Also I can't believe Drake got away from all the negative press when he was literally on stage with ppl dying as well"
s6v971,I mean people were still buying his shit even after the incident. Why? Blows my mind and I don‚Äôt blame him I blame you.
s6v971,"If the media would ""report"" the news instead of ""selling"" the news............we might not be so divided. They push the kool-aid. Just say no."
s6v971,"Search engine optimisation.  Which is why the UK public were told that our current PM likes painting pictures of buses.  Not to hide his comments earlier where he painted false claims on a bus...  If you have the money, you can give the internet amnesia."
s6v971,Seriously the Kardashians and Kenner‚Äôs have paid so many search companies and Instagram off
s6v971,People seem to have given Chris Brown a pass. Travis Scott will get one too.
s6v971,"People are still making money off him.  Can't let a cash cow die, no matter how many people it kills."
s6v971,Good. Move on. Shitty outcome but canceling him is not the answer.
s6v971,"I work at concert venues. Last show i was at, the venue had no medical staff on-site. A girl got too drunk and passed out on the floor and was helped by two other drunk guests who happened to be a doctor and nurse.

No one seems to care about Astroworld anymore, no one is taking safety precautions or making sure their venues are properly staffed. I know every day is full of bad news but that's not an excuse to put lives in danger"
s6v971,Let the man make music.
s6v971,"Wait, so now he's in the news for telling a bipolar dude (who is currently facing battery charges less than a week old) where his estranged wife is having a birthday party for their 4-year-old daughter, so he could crash it and then [swing her around at a pinata](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/s4xlgt/why_does_it_look_like_ye_is_about_to_hit_the/)? I guess that's better than causing a bunch of deaths but it's still fucking dangerous and trashy. They're lucky Travis Scott's actions didn't end up with the daugher getting kidnapped by the estranged dad all Kindergarten-Cop-style.

Edit: Now all the brainwashed kanye fans in USA have woken up I'm getting downvotes LOL. Funny how the moral compass changes with the time zones :p

I was talking about **mass murderer Travis Scott. Please focus** for one goddamn second."
s6v971,"Maybe it wasn‚Äôt his fault? Lol. Y‚Äôall so eager to cancel a successful man for some reason‚Ä¶ but why? Oh right, he‚Äôs black. And y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like to see a black man on top."
s6v971,"Why the rage on Travis Scott but not Alec Baldwin?

It's confusing sometimes, who society chooses to throw stones at."
s6v971,"The "" media"" tend to ""forget"" a lot of things..."
s6v971,He did nothing wrong! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
s6v971,"Even if the news ain't talking about astroworld, people aren't gonna forget easily. I doubt he'll be booked for any gigs anytime soon."
s6v971,It's old news. There's no reason for them to cover that story anymore
s6v971,Nobody remembers anything in this country.
s6v971,Oh my god who the hell cares. That‚Äôs how our ridiculous 24-hour news cycle works.
s6v971,A celeb not facing any consequences. In other news water is wet
s6v971,Good I‚Äôm glad guy didn‚Äôt deserve all that
s6v971,"Why/how is he directly at fault? Some people in these comments are making it sound like he literally was the one trampling the victims‚Ä¶ in my opinion he‚Äôs at fault for not having a better security and safety system but other than that it‚Äôs not like he himself is responsible for these tragedies. Society just always needs someone to blame instead of digging into the real issues, RIP to the lives lost and those affected, as a concert-goer this has broke my heart but I won‚Äôt let this blind me from using reason and logic while looking at this situation.

*open to all respectful opinions and feedback*"
s6v971,"Even if the evil monolithic media hadn't manipulated headlines or whatever, most people would have forgotten by now. The reality is that very few people actually care about this sort of thing. It was a big uproar at the time because it was in vogue to care, but in the grand scheme of things a dozen people being crushed at a concert is small time. How many people are killed due to criminal negligence or something completely senseless like a civil war every single day? Why should a Travis Scott concert hold more priority than what's going on on Ukraine, or Afghanistan or the fentanyl epidemic in San Francisco or the volcano in Tonga or the winter storm ripping through the east coast?"
s6v971,"###EVERYONE FUCKING LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I TOLD THEM LOSING A FORTNITE EMOTE WOULD BE HIS PUNISHMENT. 

fucking Reddit moment."
s6v971,Someone here called this
s6v971,Basically rich assholes helping this rich asshole by gaslighting via fake and unimportant headlines.
s74j0w,"Someone needs to float the idea to Red Bull to buy the rights to Warped Tour already. 

No other place in time could you watch professional skateboarders, bmx, eat nachos and listen to punk rock."
s74j0w,Its CRIMINAL that this is only one day.
s74j0w,The day has finally come when a bunch of my favourite bands from my angsty teenage years come together and do a show called ‚Äúwhen we were young‚Äù‚Ä¶
s74j0w,3OH!3 is still around in 2022. Wow.
s74j0w,"Warped Tour ‚Äò06 in SF, my friends and I bought scalped tickets outside the venue that ended up being fake. Mayday Parade, who were still up and coming, were standing outside the gates selling CDs. Their drummer and their merch guy came over to see what was up, and we told them about the scalped tickets, and they said screw that, let‚Äôs find this guy. So anyways, we go walking down Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf looking for the guy, and we eventually find him and point a cop in his direction. The cop made the guy give us what money he had on him, which wasn‚Äôt enough to cover all of our tickets (which I‚Äôm not even sure is entirely legal or the right procedure). After that, we ate at a nearby Taco Bell with the rest of the band. 

So awesome to see those guys on this poster after all these years."
s74j0w,"Ok, whoever came up with this show and actually got the bands to sign up is amazing. This is the best lineup for one show I have ever seen. BUT, someone really fucked up on the execution. One day?! Are you insane? This lineup deserves 3 days."
s74j0w,224 a person GA
s74j0w,How is this 1 day?  Why am I sketched out about this? Like the artists are posting it so it seems legit but I‚Äôm sketched
s74j0w,"This lineup is so insane that tons of people are asking if it's real lol. I LOVE this lineup and am so down to go, but I also share the skepticism of others. How in the hell are you gonna have all these bands perform on just 3 stages in 12 hours?"
s74j0w,Paramore and Avril Lavigne? I feel 13 again
s74j0w,Trying to wrap my head around this being one day. Sure Warped Tour is a single day but these are A LOT of heavy hitters to cram into one day.
s74j0w,"Dynamite lineup. Just missing Thrice & Circa Survive for me (and maybe Tsunami Bomb)

But yeah, either they add like 2 more stages, another whole day, or every band here plays 3-5 songs max."
s74j0w,What a crazy line up. See yall in Vegas.
s74j0w,"My math may be way off, but with 63 bands, 3 stages, and 12 hours, that leaves around 34 minutes per band not including time between acts to set up/break down. This is going to be a shit show, and it pisses me off if it actually happens. I would love for a festival with this lineup to happen (and would pay good money for it), but I don‚Äôt what them to shoot their shot on this and then not ever do something similar again."
s74j0w,"Jimmy Eats World, AFI, Bayside, and Kittie? I'm there! ETA: Somehow didn't notice the time frame and was expecting a more Coachella-type weekend deal. This is not enough time. You'll get like one or two songs per band? Sad day."
s74j0w,Gotta say this should be a 3 day festival not 1 day
s74j0w,WHY THE FUCK IS THIS ALL IN ONE SINGLE DAY?
s74j0w,"This lineup is fucking insane.

But, call me picky, I don't see any Motion City Soundtrack on that list whereas I feel like I should be seeing at least 1 Motion City Soundtrack.

Damn."
s74j0w,"Ok, much like all of you, I would kill to be at this fest. Real discussion here, is this going to be a Scam like that Fyre Fest thing? Has anyone fact checked this"
s74j0w,How the absolute hell is this not two days
s74j0w,"On such short notice, I think the promoters are trying to figure out how much money they can actually make off this. I feel like they‚Äôre gonna add another day if they reach a certain goal."
s74j0w,"Made a play list, let me know if I missed any bands. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5xSUa4UDoxCGJZyRMVoKYg?si=cf815b4e4598414d"
s74j0w,Car Seat Headrest is so random but I'm here for it.  My millennial heart may explode.
s74j0w,I‚Äôm going to set up an eyeliner and mascara tent outside the venue and make a fortune.
s74j0w,No The Academy Is.... or Cobra Starship?! üò≠üò≠
s74j0w,I would feel a lot more comfortable going to this if it was over two days. This seems like it might be a shit show.
s74j0w,"Unfortunate that Brand New and maybe All Time Low wouldn't make the cut for this due to the actions of their members(alleged actions for ATL). Would love to see From First to Last, Panic!, and Fall out Boy added to the roster"
s74j0w,Hahahaha fucking Knocked Loose seem so out of place here. I plan to catch them with Kublai Kahn Tx and this just has me giggling.
s74j0w,Rare live performance from Kittie!
s74j0w,"This isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve had it. Definitely a real festival, but yes, all 25-35 minute sets except the headliners / large font bands. 

It‚Äôs only one day so that when it inevitably sells out, they‚Äôll announce a second show that Sunday and get twice the cash.

 [First lineup‚Ä¶](https://preview.redd.it/7vwznmxpcgey.jpg?auto=webp&s=292886f3d7187da3d4e1ce333917d7a58ead7b0a)"
s74j0w,12.5k bottle service let‚Äôs goooooooooo
s74j0w,"Whelp I'm now old. Bands from my childhood are now part of a Vegas ""classics"" concert where legacy acts come together for nostalgia.

Still considering going though."
s74j0w,"Cool, Alkaline Trio is playing"
s74j0w,My wallet just grew a chain!
s74j0w,This is all the bands I was too young to go to shows for when they where at their peak - and now I am on the other side of the globe. üíîüò≠
s74j0w,I mean‚Ä¶ fuck. Almost feel like I HAVE to go.
s74j0w,"Acceptance!!!!! Thursday! Glassjaw! 

I love this so much, but why only 1 day?"
s74j0w,One day for all of this‚Ä¶ and only three stages. And we all know crowd control isn‚Äôt Live Nation‚Äôs strong suit.
s74j0w,I am about to risk it all financially for this show ‚úåüèº
s74j0w,Wtf is this lineup??? That's fucking nuts
s74j0w,Gotta cover those legal fees for live nation somehow
s74j0w,"Wait are the Killers really not on the list? Lol

And FUCK! Saosin!!!? Wonder if AG will come out.
Armor for Sleep? GEEZ! 
Hawthorn Heights!"
s74j0w,"Don't miss this is being hosted by the same organisers as Astroworld; so bring your safety whistles, first aid kits, and a defib would probably get some use."
s74j0w,I know there are major questions about logistics but my heart has me all aboard the hype train
s74j0w,Bruh i really wish escape the fate was on this one lmao
s74j0w,"Pretty good actually, it would be perfect if yellowcard(RIP),chiodos (RIP), alesana, simple plan were on the list."
s74j0w,Someone was saying this could be a scam from live nation to pay back legal fees from Astroworld. This one day concert seems super dangerous.
s74j0w,"Has anyone seen the recent post of groups supposed to be playing this saying ‚ÄúI literally found out when you did‚Äù or ‚Äúapparently we‚Äôre in this‚Äù‚Ä¶things of that nature? 
Example: All American Rejects tweeted and said ‚ÄúApparently we‚Äôre playing with ALL the bands‚Ä¶‚Äù"
s74j0w,"I understand that this is a little taboo to say, and I understand why but this lineup would be 100% complete if Brand New was on it"
s74j0w,If only never shout never was on here üò¢
s74j0w,This has fyre fest vibes
s74j0w,Wish it was streamed
s74j0w,Who tf asked for jxdn or Lil Huddy in this lineup. Lmao
s74j0w,Sucks that its a one day fest. Overlap all day and with only like thirty minute sets. Not worth traveling from NY for sadly.
s74j0w,"So a couple things to keep in mind with this show. 

1. There are a lot of bands and a very short time. Sets will be like 20 mins max. 

2. Because there are multiple stages and the times are so tight, you will not be able to see most of the bands on this roster. This is the nature of many festivals, but it feels way worse because this is a one day event.

3. The company that was responsible for the Astroworld fiasco is the company planning this event. I am deeply skeptical about the safety of this show. 

I love 90% of these bands, but I don't think I will be attending this show."
s74j0w,I think what would really complete this for me would be Fall Out Boy and Halestorm. Anyways see y'all in vegas
s74j0w,Nostalgic level 10000000
s74j0w,"Is anyone else struggling to sign up for presale? I'm seeing that it might sell out during presale so I don't want to wait for general, but every time I actually click on the sign up box it just reloads the site. Anyone else?"
s74j0w,"Brings me back to my freshman year of high school.  Some great bands put out their first albums that year.  Van Halen, Foreigner, AC/DC (well, first US release anyway)...   Why do I suddenly feel compelled to drink prune juice and yell at the sky?"
s74j0w,"the benefit for me  that it one day is i could book a round trip flight arrive in the am and  and then catch a red Eye home and only spend about $300 for GA and the flight 

the negative of it being one day  and three stages and im going to miss bands i want to see"
s74j0w,OK now I feel OFFICIALLY old.
s74j0w,$250 and ***one day?***
s74j0w,I dont think you can possibly put together a better line up than this holy shit
s74j0w,"But where's my offspring, pennywise,  bad religion, and nofx and sum41 and Lit? I feel cheated"
s74j0w,"It‚Äôs weird seeing these bands out of the context of an IPod nano. I wonder if each of these will play the one song I had of them, and if some songs will be miss attributed to other bands"
s74j0w,"250 for a day of music...but I guess split up its still like 6 bucks per band, just like days of old..."
s74j0w,"I 100% would pay 600 a ticket if it was multiple days.. But alas... 

Math here just doesn't check out. They say 11am to midnight for the hours.. So 13 hours total.. if there is only 1 band performing at a time that's 13hr x 60 minutes in an hour for a total of 780 total minutes. Divide that by the 67 bands that's **11.64 minutes per band.** 

Even if your rotating through the 3 stages & have multiple bands playing at once its 34.92 minutes which sounds good till you include that setup & teardown for each set is included in that as well. 

As much as that line up gives me good feels all the way down there is no way I could justify paying for the clusterfuck this will inevitably be."
s74j0w,It weirds me out that there‚Äôs no parking either. They really expect these hundreds/thousands of people to all be dropped off 2-3 at a time via ridesharing??
s74j0w,Anyone wanna go in on the cabana?
s74j0w,"Or, you could call it the ""When I was 32"" fest."
s74j0w,"People keep complaining about the price like MCR wasn't charging this much for their comeback tour with just them announced.... Everything else is a bonus. I am a little concerned about the scam thing, but I think it's likely they just overbooked with the expectation some will drop out due to COVID. Right now it's looking like 30 min sets with rotating stage and it some drop out sets get longer. I think I can deal with that."
s74j0w,That's a lot of bull shit just to see horror pops.
s74j0w,"Bayside, taking back Sunday, senses fail, pierce the veil, and mayday all have killer sets and are probs some if the best shows I've ever been to live.  Bayside is probably the best.  

For bands I haven't seen live yet due to bullshit,  my chem and the used are tops of my hype list.  1000% going idgaf.  And for people saying 30 minute sets aren't enough, have yall ever been to warped?  Lo

Oh shit Thursday is on here too, add to hype"
s74j0w,First time I‚Äôve ever seen TV Girl on a lineup. Dope
s74j0w,Wowza
s74j0w,This might be silly but how is this down payment thing supposed to work for this festival?
s74j0w,This is an excellent collection of bands i heard of in high school but never listened to because i was too busy with boards of canada and radiohead
s74j0w,"Yes, I‚Äôll pay hundreds of dollars to hear 3-5 songs from my favorite bands.  Do I get an NFT too?!"
s74j0w,Sheeshhhhhhhhh
s74j0w,"I was and still am super excited about the idea of this, but I can‚Äôt even find it on Live Nations website."
s74j0w,So many nostalgic great bands. Then there is lil huddy. Why
s74j0w,Why on earth are knocked loose playing here lol
s74j0w,Not sure how Bright Eyes fits the bill. Saw one artists I knew and liked and a bunch of stuff I‚Äôve never heard of.
s74j0w,"As many others have said, it doesn‚Äôt feel like there is enough to time for each band. That being said, this lineup is something out of a dream and I for one don‚Äôt want to miss it. Las Vegas, here I come"
s74j0w,"I'm not old, am I? *Looks at wife and kids* *looks at old Gameboy collection* I'm only 29 man! *Checks 401K balance*"
s74j0w,I wish brand new was there at the lineup
s74j0w,The best lineup I've ever seen
s74j0w,Can you feel your heartbeat racing? Can you taste the fear in your sweat? √ò
s74j0w,They have lost their mind with those prices. I‚Äôll wait for Buzzfest here in Houston. $30 tickets for like 20 bands.
s74j0w,Should have just called it Millennials Unite Lolol
s74j0w,This is not going to work
s74j0w,"Sounds too good to be true tbh. I'm very skeptical of the outcome. 

I wouldn't be surprised if bands pulled out at the last minute, idk."
s74j0w,"I'm actually a little confused and maybe I'm doing my math wrong but there's 69? Artists playing. It's a 12 hour show. 
There's 720 minutes in 12 hours which is roughly 10.4 minutes for each band? What?

And the stage is rotating so only 1 band is playing at a time.

I think this is a hoax tbh"
s74j0w,"High key scam. Literally not enough time in the day to have all these people come. We can do math love nation. Y'all, do not buy the tickets"
s74j0w,[deleted]
s74j0w,"Where, the fuck, are Finch?!"
s74j0w,I‚Äôm afraid this is going to be a scam üíØüíØüíØ
s74j0w,"Short sets normally wouldn't be ideal. But these bands, I think I just want to hear the big songs anyway.

Have the main stage be dedicated to the headliners giving them real sets. 

But most the bands? 10-20 minutes. Play the handful of songs the whole crowd knows. People that want to hear  Hawthorne Heights deep cuts can go see them on tour. I bet it's less than $20, to see them in a better venue than a festival. For this fest, just pop them on, play Ohio is For Lovers and get them out the way so We The Kings up there to play thier 3 hits and move on.

I am curious to see when this schedule comes out how they attack this. If they have any ideas to get bands in and out without a full tear down and set up so they can go rapid fire through some of these acts."
s74j0w,"Literally every other festival is no refunds, why do ppl think it‚Äôs a scam bc of this?ü§£ü§£"
s74j0w,"Roger Waters should go to that and perform in front of very bright lights. That way, the next day he can turn to a bandmate and say  ""remember When We Were Young? We shone like the sun."""
s74j0w,I wish the Strokes were on this lineup.
s74j0w,"250 dollars to watch some admittedly  great bands play 30 minute sets and no guarantee I'd even be able to  watch all of the ones i would want to watch? 

Pass."
s74j0w,I feel like the bouncing souls should be in on this.
s74j0w,"When We Were Young?

More like When We Were In College.

And those prices!  OMG!"
s74j0w,wAARPed Tour
s74j0w,The When We Were Young Tour in \*Las Vegas\* doesn't feature The Killers? GTFOH
s74j0w,Apparently a lot of band members have no idea that they‚Äôre playing this tour they‚Äôre coming out and speaking about it now. This shits probably going to get canceled or a lot of these bands won‚Äôt be here. I‚Äôm pretty sure taking back Sunday just broke up and the lead singer for senses fail had no idea about this.
s74j0w,"So the conspiracy behind this, because Live Nation is behind astroworld and they‚Äôre dealing with law suits. They needed a plan to get money ASAP for all the damage they‚Äôve done. The astroworld lawsuits are gonna hurt their pockets lol. 

What other better way than to get a line up of some of the OG‚Äôs, have no refunds, and make it all in one day? Also giving Fyre Festival vibes. 

Then again Live Nation is behind most of the festivals world wide. 

Some people are wondering if they are gonna up their safety since the astroworld fest?"
s74j0w,This is the same people that organized Astroworld. That just took away all my excitement.
s74j0w,"63 bands, 3 stages, 1 day, starting at $225 presale with no refunds (no exceptions listed whatsoever) hosted by the same people that did Astroworld and are now dealing with the hefty lawsuits? With multiple bands coming out saying they didn‚Äôt even know they were on the lineup (All American Rejects, Royal and the Serpent)? It‚Äôs a no from me."
s74j0w,No where on the website does it say 3 days
s74j0w,Emo FyreFest
s74j0w,"Oh, to relive the worst years of warped tour.

AND $200+ for a twelve hour event. They are seriously cashing in on nostalgia here."
s74j0w,I heard that not all the bands will really be there. They‚Äôll have music on a PA. Hope it‚Äôs not true but would love clarification.
s74j0w,Well this could be a superspreader
s74j0w,Linda Lindas!!! Yes!! Go for it girls!!
s74j0w,Now That‚Äôs What I Call Shitty Music
s74j0w,"Might just be the worst line up of all time, props to the organizers didn't know it a was a record someone was going for but hey ho."
s74j0w,"It shouldn‚Äôt be hard to add Saves the Day, right? This line up is awesome but they were my #1"
s74j0w,Prolly be canceled. Punk rock bowling was just canceled
s74j0w,this seems like a cash grab
s74j0w,[deleted]
s74j0w,So many terrible haircuts
s74j0w,"You know a festival is going to suck when all the bands have their own font, instead of just a list of who is playing."
s74j0w,Wow I've never seen a list this big of bands I don't wanna see
s74j0w,Eww.
s74j0w,I‚Äôd rather scrape my taint with a rusty razor than attend this mope fest
s74j0w,"Ha, darned near every formulaic band I thought I was too smart to like.

Also me: thought repetitive electro music was unique and different.

Still me: thinks Underworld and Aphex Twin is better than all of these bands combined."
s74j0w,[deleted]
s74j0w,"i keep seeing people say the organizers are the same people behind Astroworld, is there any truth to that?"
s74j0w,Festival should have just been called Millenium Dreamer
s74j0w,Definitely going.  Would love to meetup with anyone here.
s74j0w,Is anyone actually able to sign up for presale? It just loads the page again for me
s8i6r0,Fuck that racist puto!
s8i6r0,beautiful song but also the most over-rated guitarist of all time (imo)
s8i6r0, This song is so good you could play it at a Slayer concert and everyone would show respect.
s8i6r0,The anti vaccine stuff makes him a shit head but Clap is the real thing on guitar. Listen to Crossroads.
s8i6r0,I'm sorry but Mr.Clapton is scheduled for cancellation this month.
s8i6r0,Fucking tool
s8i6r0,Kid fall out a window while unsupervised?! Cash in!!!
s8i6r0,He said some bad things 45 years ago before he got sober. Cancel!
s7gpm9,Have you heard time? It‚Äôs my favorite PF song
s7gpm9,"It is also worth noting that the song and album dealt with the band watching one of their founding members (Syd Barrett) slowly slipping away from them due to serious mental health issues.

Think about that.  You've got this friend who was incredibly creative and the driving force behind your group.  The shining star among you.  Then something changes.  You watch him slowly lose his grip on reality.  This genius who you loved and created wonderful music with is fading away into his own world.

And the record company needs another album.

As someone said a bit ago, it's heartbreaking."
s7gpm9,"You run and you run 
To catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older 
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death."
s7gpm9,"When I was a child 

I caught a fleeting glimpse

Out of the corner of my eye

I turned to look but it was gone

I cannot put my finger on it now

The child is grown

The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb"
s7gpm9,I believe this is a perfect song. It's simple and beautiful and heartbreaking and poetic.
s7gpm9,"I never assumed that line was literal.  I thought it meant being scared of living life, and keeping yourself small and timid."
s7gpm9,The live version from 'Pulse' is the best version of 'Wish You Were Here'imo.
s7gpm9,Dark side of the moon is one of the best albums ever created.
s7gpm9,"Keep exploring Pink Floyd and you'll find that those of us out of jail are going to a war every day of our lives. 

Well, most days."
s7gpm9,"I have a great memory of a hot summer night under the stars in a stadium with 40,000 plus other humans enjoying this song live, by the greatest rock band ever to rock. Looked around, every person mesmerized swaying softly singing along. And all of us knew every single word although it's nonsensical. It was pure magic."
s7gpm9,"and if they catch you in the back seat
trying to pick her locks, 
they‚Äôre going to send you back to mother
in a cardboard box.  

‚Äòrun like hell‚Äô

first time i heard this i was 12.  the coolest, scariest description i heard in a song up until that point."
s7gpm9,"classic rock, is my choice of music, and Pink Floyd, is still one of my all time favorite bands.."
s7gpm9,This is album oriented rock. To really get the gist of it you need to listen to every song start to finish and in order. I recommend Animals and a fat spliff.
s7gpm9,"Like some of their dreamscapes such as ""A Pillow of Winds"". 

Or, ""Let there be Light""."
s7gpm9,Check out When the Tigers Broke Free for more wartime sadness
s7gpm9,"Pink Floyd is great. I know Dark Side of the Moon gets most of the love (and it's well deserved), but The Wall is my favorite album of theirs.  

If you're just getting into older rock, I'd recommend checking out Queensryche's *Operation: Mindcrime* and Savatage's *Streets: A Rock Opera.*  Both are concept albums with awesome lyrics."
s7gpm9,"I‚Äôve listened to endless underground hip hop, and lyric depth is mostly my jam.  It‚Äôs funny you mentioned ‚ÄòWish you were here‚Äô specifically, because Pink Floyd has COUNTLESS smashing hits, and it‚Äôs one of them.  When I specifically discovered ‚Äòwish you were here‚Äô, I was stunned at how it isn‚Äôt considered right up there with ‚Äòcomfortably numb‚Äô or ‚Äòanother brick in the wall‚Äô.  I can listen to ‚Äòwish you were here‚Äô (and have) 5 times in a row, and love it every time.  I cannot say that about many songs."
s7gpm9,"You haven‚Äôt been listening to the right rap then. The artists you listed are of the lowest tier rappers when it comes to deep lyrics. You have rappers like Common, Nas, Lupe Fiasco. Seriously. Don‚Äôt get me wrong not shitting on Pink Floyd. I absolutely love ‚ÄúAtom Heart Mother Suite‚Äù and ‚ÄúHave A Cigar‚Äù is one of my favorite songs ever. But don‚Äôt ever say that you can‚Äôt get good deep and meaningful lyrics from rap when all you listen to is trash rap.

I got into rock again probably nine months ago (and took a proper dive this time) and oh my God the amount of great music I've found in this time period is absolutely mind-boggling. We need more rock than there has been nowadays.

Edit: and my rock-fanatic buddy says that another Pink Floyd song, *Echoes*, is the greatest song of all time. I (still) haven't given it a proper listen because it's like 20 minutes long but check it out if you're interested"

s7gpm9,"The entire album and concept of Wish You Were Here is by far one of the best, however it's still not even their best work as proven by ""Animals"" in 1977 and ""The Wall"" in 1979. However, the concept of missing a friend destroyed by the music industry/drugs is extremely depressing once you learn about what happened to Roger ""Syd"" Barrett, the former guitarist for Floyd back in the 60's."
s7gpm9,"I saw them for their Division Bell tour.  It is still the best concert I have ever seen, and I have seen some great ones."
s7gpm9,"When you hear the backstory of that song, It gains even another level of complexity.  Basically their first singer was chewed up and spat out by the record industry.  Fried his brain on drugs (to the point of mental handicap), and the band wrote the song Shine on you Crazy Diamond for him and Wish you were here.

You Crazy

s7gpm9,"\>Imagine living in a time were it was either go to war or go to jail

I don't think he was being literal; the song and album were a ""postcard to Syd Barrett"" who apparently had schizophrenia and was unable to continue with Pink Floyd. He's talking about fame here, a ""walk on part in a war"" is the anonymous lives we all lead, where ""a lead role in a cage"" is the life of the famous or powerful, and is pointing to how damaging fame is for some people, how fame ends up forcing some into an isolated existence.

(And an edit, the guys in PF never faced a draft-or-jail scenario, that would have been VietNam in the US of the late 60's)."
s7gpm9,"Pink Floyd has always been my favorite band. From start to finish their whole catalog is just fantastic. No other band does such a flawless job at evoking images and emotions, you don't listen to their music, you feel it."
s7gpm9,"Brah, you being 19, you are just scratching the surface of this song. Listen to it again when you are 30 and then again when you are 40. It‚Äôll hit you much deeper then. The lyrics change in a way as you experience life and hardship."
s7gpm9,Mother.
s7gpm9,"Hey awesome for you to share your discovery of Pink Floyd with us. The metaphor, social and political commentary, and overall writing is timeless in its applicability to any given generation. I also agree that hip hop has trouble expressing itself so eloquently, but there is a ton of conscious stuff out there - especially from the early days and some of the late 90‚Äôs - early 2000‚Äôs underground scene. 

Anyway, keep enjoying PF and do yourself a favor and listen to the live Echoes album."
s7gpm9,"You should look into the history of the song. It's about the original lead singer and his descent into madness after an infamous drug fueled weekend. It's a beautiful elegy to a lost friend and inspired musician;Syd Barrett.

Edit : His mental illness absolutely existed before the weekend; it's simply a moment his friends pointed to as a moment of noticable change. He did LSD many times before that weekend as well but something was different about this time. Enough to where the incident has become a legend in itself."

s7gpm9,"Slippery slope to head into prog rock. There is so much amazing music to be found and PF is often the gateway. 

Come hang out in r/progrockmusic we'd be glad to have you."
s7gpm9,"Like someone else stated, 'Time' is my absolute favorite PF song, ever.
The entirety on Dark Side of the Moon is amazing and my favorite album ever, as cliche as that sounds.  But to a younger, far more depressed me, who was intermittently suicidal, that album brought me so much.

I felt hope and peace, pain and despair, so many varying emotions while listening to it. 
Great Gig in the Sky, which is pretty much just vocalization with no actual lyrics, actually tapped into so much of my mind at that point. Here was someone just....howling. thats the wrong word, she's singing of course, but there are no words. She doesn't need them. I felt her emotions with no words. It echoed all the times i wanted to cry and scream my heart out, until i didnt hurt anymore and it helped. Because i couldn't go out and yell and scream and cry but i could listen to someone else do it and close my eyes and in my head i would sing along with her and let myself feel the emotions and let them go. It was cathartic


I really could go on for hours and sound like a snob, but back to my original intent, Time.
Time is the song that has consistently been my go-to. I identify so strongly with the lyrics, it feels like my life played out, but also a warning not to let myself waste away and do nothing for years, until i finally wake up and it's too late.


It also keeps me hopeful and strangely at peace. 
""But you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking. Racing behind to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older. Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.""


That line. That right there literally jumped out at me. A young, depressed, suicidal me heard that line and it ached and hurt, it felt like a warning, like my life was doomed to be a waste, but it also brought me peace and hope. 
I know that sounds strange, but. It doesn't feel strange. That one day, no matter how i live my life, it will all be over, but that the world turns on, that life still continues for others, that the sun will be unchanged, and still bringing life and warmth to millions around the globe. That one day, i get to rest and finally be at peace. No more slogging through life. No more wasting away, no more mental health issues. Just peace. Perhaps i get to see loved ones again. Perhaps theres nothing beyond life. 


But whatever the answer, that line helps keep me going. To know that i dont have to waste my days in monotony, that i can keep pressing forward and that yeah, im closer to death every day, but its something that i'll welcome when the time comes because ill be at peace, and the sun will continue to rise.
I'm gonna do what i can to live my life my fullest, and not just be bogged down forever. Yeah, its a constant struggle, especially with my mental health, but as long as i keep trying, i'll make it out ok in the end.


Even when that end means death, ultimately. It's strangely comforting."

s7gpm9,"Listen to Dark Side of the Moon all the way through. Then Echoes.

You've opened an entire new world my friend. Pink Floyd is a gateway band. But Wish You Were Here, while an excellent song, is just one of the many incredible songs Pink Floyd has.

Definitely start with Dark Side of The Moon though, it's wonderful and a great album to start with."
s7gpm9,"Old Floyd head here and the comparison to rap is BS. There is a ton of lyrical genius and real poetry in hip hop. One era of music or one genre of music is not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù objectively than another just because you happen to like it.  Floyd lyrics are pseudo-profound, which was typical of he era. Appeals to teenagers. By the way wish you were here was the first album I ever bought. I‚Äôm not knocking it. I was the target market: a 12 year old white suburban boy in 1975.  Also if this is your first taste of classic rock, rest assured there was a ton of total dreck produced in that era too.

Now do KRS-1."
s7gpm9,"I made some time to listen to the Wall from beginning to end, complete, the way it should be done, recently and when I got to Waiting for the Worms, man, it really hit me. They managed to capture the essence of the US white supremacist ethos in four minutes. I was trying to figure out how they knew back then what they were like now and I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it until it hit me that Waters and Gilmour were just that good of songwriters and that these dark impulses have always been around. The Wall is a lot of work to listen to, it‚Äôs a lot to unpack and process, but there‚Äôs a lot there to connect to."
s7gpm9,"You really have to listen to the whole album in order.

Wish You Were Here is a great song, and they have so many others. I hope you decide to give their other albums a listen. Pink Floyd has a history that can be found just by listening to the discography."
s7gpm9,"Gilmore's guitar is often played so masterfully in context with their songs. The guitar solo from comfortably numb is often voted "" best guitar solo of all time "" in polls . You can feel the - Anguish -  pour out of his soul , with that solo. 

That's something else Rap doesn't  get to take advantage of . The instruments become part of the lyrics.  A guitarist that can express their emotions with their guitar has reached their pinnacle, imo.  Rap is good, just a different kind of good."

s7gpm9,"One of my favorite bands. WYWH is timeless. My 4 favorite albums of theirs are the periods from Meddle to Animals (which includes WYWH). I‚Äôll probably catch hate for this, but I think they started losing their spark when they recorded The Wall. I know that album well, and it had a place in my late teenage heart. Some of the songs are amazing, but over time I found that album to be too maudlin, and if you know the story about what was going on with the tensions in the band at that time, it loses some of its luster.

As far as rap goes, I‚Äôm an old man. Gimme some Beastie Boys, NWA (and the members‚Äô solo albums), Wu-Tang, Snoop, Ghetto Boys, etc."

Needless to say by the end of the day I had his assurance that when he wins his first award.. and don't get me wrong this kid got gas.. he has to thank the Beatles and Pink Floyd for their inspiration.. Rock on my young friend"

I would highly recommend beginning by listening to the album Dark Side of the Moon in it's entirety, start to finish. Preferably while massively stoned, if that's your cup of tea.

Then do it again for The Wall."

s7gpm9,"I‚Äôve always considered this particular line - ‚Äúdid you exchange ‚Ä¶‚Äù - to be about the culture war, the war for creative freedom, the war that Pink Floyd seemed to be leading, but written first person to and about Syd Barrett. The ‚Äúrole in a cage‚Äù speaks less about jail as much as a padded cell where personal responsibility for said social action gets shunted to the side, or ignored completely, because, you know, crazy. Tragic crazy.

At least that‚Äôs how it hits me the deepest."
s7gpm9,"This is one of my favourite Pink Floyd songs (Shine on You Crazy Diamond is awesome!) and albums. I actually prefer it to Dark Side.

And I bought it as an vinyl in 1975, and it came with a postcard! I sent it to my girlfriend and 4 years later we were married. Still together 42 years later. Not saying ""Wishing she was here"" helped, but it didn't hurt! LOL"
s7gpm9,"Almost every Pink Floyd song is amazing.  Only some of them are ""just ok.""  Probably can count the just ok ones on your hands.  Maybe even 1 hand.

If you're new to Pink Floyd, I'm gonna recommend you see the movie ""[The Wall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/)"" which is basically their album, ""The Wall,"" made into a motion picture.

Another interesting bit of info to know about Pink Floyd & the song ""Wish you were here,"" is that it was written about the band's founding member & original lead singer Syd Barrett.  A man who went insane apparently simply by making music (with LSD helping to push him over an edge that the band claims he was already careening towards).

Syd was forced out of the band.  Syd attempted a solo career, which was helped by members of Pink Floyd who helped him record & master solo works.  But this only drove him even more crazy. He stopped making music & nobody had heard from him for years.  Then, mysteriously, as they were recording the song ""Wish you were here,"" Syd showed up to the studio.  Completely shaven.  No hair whatsoever (including no eye brows).  At first most of the band didn't recognize him, but once they realized who it was, they broke down into tears.  Syd was there to tell them he was ready for them to use his talents again.  I don't remember if they tried to work him back into the band, but Nick Mason noted that there was a point where he was brushing his teeth and jumping up & down at the same time.  After that day, he disappeared again.  It was eventually known that he had moved in with his sister & had begun painting in his spare time.  He died not long ago."
s7gpm9,"Fun fact: I used to think it was ""a walk-on part in The Wall"" as a reference to their other album. When I found out that WYWH was released over 2 years before The Wall, I just thought ""wow. They really pre-planned their albums.""  The latter part isnt completely inaccurate as you can find old concerts where theyll play prototype versions of songs like Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Dogs well before WYWH or Animals was released. 

I also really like the lyrics ""Were just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year.  Running over the same old ground.  What have we found? The same old fears.  Wish you Were here.""  So many emotions conveyed in those lines. Isolation and repetition.  Kinship and longing.  Amazing.

If you have a low-fi playlist I‚Äôll definitely check it out."
s8jf11,Probably Alt Rock or 80s to 00s metal
s8jf11,classical but i guess more on the later romatic era
s8jf11,"Metal overall. Far too many sub-genres to pick a distinct favourite, and tbh I'll generally listen to a handful of bands from any given one. If I really had to pick, it would probably be doom metal related."
s8byeh,"Is music a hobby for you? If so, do it as long as it makes you happy and fulfilled.

Your family is probably just trying to get you to choose what they think is best for you. If you know and trust a lot of adults in your life, ask them one question: *Do you wish you had worked harder in school?* I think you might be surprised to learn how many will answer ""yes."" 

If quitting band doesn't leave a hole in your soul, and if you feel like you need to prioritize education right now, it's probably a good idea to at least consider quitting band."

s89cx6,Yeah. That stuff does kick some ass.

s7zzqh,I think Jerry Cantrell backing up Layne Staley was as good as I've ever heard. The classic Alice in Chains sound is the harmony between those two.

s7zzqh,Roger Taylor of Queen. He had an amazing vocals and outstanding falsetto. He might be the back vocalist in Queen but he was a great singer himself.

In the United States they are basically a one hit wonder, Song 2, and I'd best most people couldnt even tell you then correct name of that song, people here will think its called Whoo Hoo, or who it's by.  And even it's one hit wonder status is dubious as it wasnt really a hit so much as it's been used a lot in commercials with the Whoo Hoo part.  Much more popular here is Albarns other band Gorillaz."

You also  could think of these as AM and FM because you could hear them on both types of stations back then.  Those were really great years for inventive music and, as you said, a broad spectrum.

s7gju4,"Placebo. Can headline a festival in UK/Europe, struggle to fIll a mid size club in the US. They don't even really bother to come here any longer, much to my dismay. Managed to catch them once and it was an amazing show."
s7gju4,"[Powderfinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnPV6CNdG3M) were pretty big in Australia back in the late 90s and 2000s, but I don't think they got much recognition overseas. Such a shame really, they're a great band but their style is kinda chill and laid back, not really in your face and attention grabbing, so I can understand why they didn't catch on elsewhere."
s7gju4,"Hardly known in the USA (where he lived),during the 70s his albums were huge in South Africa, Australia and NZ. And he never even knew how successful he was overseas, to the extent that he basically gave up music and disappeared, until fans found him a couple of decades later.

[Sixto Rodriguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixto_Rodriguez)

> Sixto Diaz Rodriguez (born July 10, 1942), known professionally as Rodriguez, is an American singer-songwriter from Detroit, Michigan. Though his career was initially met with little fanfare in the United States, he found success in South Africa, Australia (touring the country twice), and New Zealand. Unbeknownst to him for decades, his music was extremely successful and influential in South Africa, where he is believed to have sold more records than Elvis Presley, as well as other countries in Southern Africa"
s7gju4,"To this day, not a lot of people in the US have the slightest clue who Robbie Williams is."
s7gju4,"Fat Freddy‚Äôs Drop

An incredible New Zealand band that mixes soulful vocals, dub, reggae, and more. Criminally unknown in the US. 

Check out their 2005 album Based on a True Story"
s7gju4,Manic Street Preachers are huge in the UK. They topped both the singles and albums charts in 1998 and are still popular enough to have had a number one album again last year. They have had another 10 albums reach the top 5. Still hardly known in the US/Canada.
s7gju4,"Apparently, Gojira is barely known in France despite being one of the biggest metal bands rn"
s7gju4,"Anyone say Kylie Minogue? Despite all of her number 1 hit records and songs, and starting a music career in 1987, she didn't tour the US until 2009. Even then, it was only around 10 shows. She then toured again in 2012, but hasn't returned since.

But she has played countless nights to sell out crowds in the UK and Australia every year."
s7gju4,X Japan
s7gju4,"Slade - Slade was a glam rock band from England. In the early 80s, Towards the end of their career, I would say, they made an appearance in America with a song called ""My Oh My."" I remember hearing this song and I really liked it. I wanted to hear more. But the band and the song quickly disappeared.

My interest in Slade rekindled because I found out that the Christmas song they would play in early Doctor Who episodes is Slade's, ""Merry Christmas, Everybody."" I noticed it because I think it's the only Christmas song Doctor Who plays. I had to know who sang that song, and that's when I found out more about Slade. 

Fast forward to... oh, I would say ten years ago or so that I found them again. They're on my Spotify. While they're no longer together, I can now enjoy their entire discography as much as I want."
s7gju4,"I‚Äôm pretty sure Kasabian were huge in the UK/EU, basically unknown here in the US."
s7gju4,"So Americans don't know ""mon the biff""?"
s7gju4,"Status Quo, big in the U.K."
s7gju4,Pulp. One of the biggest bands of the 90s in the UK but I don't think they ever made much of a splash in the US.
s7gju4,"Agent Fresco are huge in Iceland. They‚Äôre REALLY good, though."
s7gju4,"Dave Matthews Band seemed to be massive in the US, but largely ignored elsewhere."
s7gju4,"Travis. Took a trip to the UK in 2000 and they were EVERYWHERE! ‚ÄúWhy Does it Always Rain on Me?‚Äù was playing nonstop for the two weeks I was there. Bought THE MAN WHO and it remains one of my all time favorite albums. I kept waiting for them to get famous here in the US and it just never seemed to happen. Although the song ‚ÄúSing‚Äù does make an appearance on an early episode of the American version of the Office, so that‚Äôs something üòÄ"
s7gju4,"Hilltop Hoods.

 They basically created the genre of Aussie hip-hop as we know it today. Also tied for the most entries in the Hottest 100 with Foo fighters at 21 tracks and hold the record for most number one albums as an Aussie band with six of their eight taking the top spot on release."
s7gju4,Dave Matthews Band have had 7 no. 1 albums in the US but have yet to crack the top 50 in the UK. They remain largely unknown outside of the US/Canada.
s7gju4,"The Beatles are very popular in America and Europe.  But in Ghana, they are not that popular. The Swedish group, ABBA is very popular here."
s7gju4,"The Stranglers were a western world phenomenon but are virtually unknown in the US. 

‚ÄúSkin Deep‚Äù peaked at #39 as a dance single here in 1984. College radio played a couple other songs, but no notable chart action. MTV 120 Minutes featured ‚ÄúAlways The Sun‚Äù for about 2 months.

The only US film to include them was ‚ÄòPermanent Record‚Äô which used their cover of ‚ÄúAll Day And All Of The Night‚Äù as background music.

Their music was not broadcast on TV except when Entertainment Tonight used a wordless section loop of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Celebrate‚Äù behind celebrity birthday announcements for a month is so in 1990."
s7gju4,"Fun Lovin' Criminals were huge in the UK for quite a long time, not so much in their home country of the US.

Meanwhile Bush were pretty big in the US but nobody paid much attention to them in the UK beyond their first single despite them being British.

No longer true but for a brief period Radiohead were much bigger in the US than the UK during the Pablo Honey era. Opposite happened to the White Stripes who cracked the UK before the US despite being from the US - though I think that was a deliberate strategy as there was a period of time in the early 2000s when US labels would push bands in the smaller (and cheaper) UK market first."
s7gju4,"I'm not sure how unknown Bush are in their homeland, but I know they were always bigger in the US. I have a buddy from the UK who's a musician and a big rock fan in general and had never heard of Bush when I brought them up a year ago. When I told him they were from his country and that their frontman was married to Gwen Stefani for like 15 years he was shocked, but still had no inkling of who they were.

After Monster Magnet had their one hit in the US with Spacelord they largely faded into obscurity in the US, but I remember they continued to tour pretty regularly in Europe for years afterwards hardly even playing shows in the US (if memory serves me correctly), so I've always assumed they were/are more successful over there post-Powertrip LP."
s7gju4,"Mcfly.

Absolutely dominated the UK charts with 7 no. 1s in less than 4 years (2003 - 2007) but never caught on in the US. 

Their debut single did okay over there and they were even heavily featured in a Hollywood film with Chris Pine and Lindsey Lohan but still no one knows who they are."
s7gju4,"Gonna go with [Split Enz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_Enz). Never really popped in the US despite success in their native NZ, AU, UK, and Canada.

Neil Finn would of course go on to find success in Crowded House."
s7gju4,Vicente Fernandez in Mexico and Hispanic America but not in the rest of the US
s7gju4,You get an upvote for Biffy Clyro. I live in the US and they've been my favorite band since Opposites. Been listening since Only Revolutions though.
s7gju4,The Danish band Kashmir
s7gju4,"Kent were arguably the biggest band in Sweden through the noughties, yet virtually unknown in the English speaking world.

They tried to break through. They re-recorded two of their albums in English but they never caught on, so now they record purely in Swedish again."
s7gju4,Ben Harper was apparently big in Australia for years before making a name in the US
s7gju4,Marillion. Hardly made a noise in Canada and the US. But still huge in Europe.
s7gju4,"Definitely Girls Aloud. Huge in the UK back in the 2000‚Äôs, number one albums and singles, meanwhile never really bothered breaking into the US market. (I don‚Äôt think any of their singles ever charted in the US)

Actually, a couple UK bands never really broke into the US market. Another example would be Sugababes, mega stars in the UK but if they walked down the street in the US most likely no one would know who they even are."
s7gju4,Basically any brazilian band except Sepultura
s7gju4,"The Jam, and Paul Weller as a solo artist, never caught on in the US. That‚Äôs a shame. Paul Weller has written a lot of great songs."
s7gju4,"Manic Street Preachers. Same as Biffy, pretty huge in the UK, but no one knows who they are in the US"
s7gju4,"Nightwish.

Not unknown exactly, especially after the youtube reaction craze, but far less known than in their native Finland, where they are the best selling band of all time."
s7gju4,"This is not exactly what you mean, because he's obviously not unknown in the US. However, I'm reminded of when I went to see Morrissey in the US, and most of my friends were like ""who's that?"" He obviously has a decent enough following here to sell out the medium size theater I saw him in, but I guarantee you that a random sampling of 40-something people in the UK don't say ""who's that?"" when Morrissey is mentioned."
s7gju4,Mr Big in Japan
s7gju4,"The Jam was probably the biggest band of the early 80s in the UK. They remain almost totally unknown in the US. That's a shame because they're utterly fantastic with a deep catalog of fantastic songs and albums. Strangely, Paul Weller's followup band The Style Council was actually more popular than The Jam in the US."
s7gju4,David Hasselhoff is huge in Germany.
s7gju4,DMAs
s7gju4,"Toto - Can sell-out arenas all over the world, can barely fill the 1,800 seat Wiltern Theatre in L.A."
s7gju4,"Cliff Richard was relatively unknown in the US, I remembered when I was a kid."
s7gju4,"I'm not sure anyone remembers Dschinghis Khan in Germany, but they were still gathering large crowds in Russia in 00's and 10's at various retro shows. They even re-recorded their main hit song for 2018 soccer cup in Moscow, and made a video for it in 2019 on the Red Square.

To a lesser degree, the same goes for a lot of 80's disco groups that were covertly super-popular in late-period USSR: Boney M, Arabesque, Ottawan, Italian disco bands and singers."
s7gju4,"I was watching a youtube video a few hours ago where the guy mentioned that Rush just never made it to New Zealand for whatever reason. So despite being a drummer he had never actually heard Neil Peart play until recently because they're just a total non-entity in NZ pop culture. 

His other example was Journey, who was a completely unknown quantity for decades until, of all things, Glee covered Don't Stop Believing. Ten years ago nobody knew them beyond ""oh yeah I hear they're big in America"" and now every shitty pub band closes with that song. 

For a more personal example, I'm American, and like fifteen years ago I was doing a school project where I needed examples of political songs. I asked a forum I was on that had a high concentration of Australians and they were all *absolutely stunned* that I didn't immediately jump to Midnight Oil. I understand now how massive they are down there but seriously they may as well not exist in the states."
s7gju4,Powderfinger - Huge in Australia! Saw them at their height at a UK festival (Hyde Park I think) they were first on the bill at 1000.
s7gju4,"Well I'm Brazilian, we have one of the most insulated music scenes in the world. Some styles of music only really have success here like samba, or sertanejo, ax√© and all.

What happens here is the opposite sometimes.

Some heavy metal bands like Sepultura are way more respected outside of Brazil than in here. CSS was also a electro band from Brazil that was very well known outside of Brazil, but here people even didn't know that they were from here."
s7gju4,The Jam in the UK were huge at the end of the 70s and early 80s spawning several number one hits. Never gained popularity in the US and as far as I am aware most other countries
s7gju4,"Arkells in Canada. They‚Äôll play sold out arenas and halftime shows at football games up there but play small venues and sometimes bars in the US. Planning on catching them in May when they come to Chicago

I just found this guy Adriano Celentano who‚Äôs apparently an icon in Italy, I had never heard of him before but started watching a pro shot concert from 2012 and it‚Äôs actually fantastic despite my inability to understand the lyrics (aside from some English covers he does, which is pretty cool I think). Never ceases to amaze me the obscure stuff Reddit can turn me on to"
s7gju4,The Libertines in the UK
s7gju4,Not sure it fully counts because they were definitely getting lots of coverage outside of the UK but I remember moving to Canada from the UK and literally nobody I could find knowing who Arctic Monkeys were. Then AM came out and they fully got their foot into North America to say the least.
s7gju4,"Paul Weller. In the UK he is one of the biggest and most respected musicians, massive hits with The Jam, The Style Council and solo and he is still making great music and seems to be in a golden spell at the moment. But not big in USA or anywhere else, not on the scale he is known in the UK."
s7gju4,"Not bands, but Stromae was super huge in Europe and especially in Belgium and France like 6 years ago. He filled stadiums all over Europe but basically unheard of in other continents. He returned some months ago and his songs are already #1 in France. Same thing for Ang√®le (she collaborated with Dua Lipa on the song ""Fever"")."
s7gju4,"Skyhooks in Australia. A glam rock staple of Aussie music in the 70s and 80s. Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden was apparently jealous (in a supportive way) of lead singer Graeme ""Shirley"" Strachan's voice! Unfortunately, Shirl died in a helicopter accident in 2001. They should've been much bigger than they were."
s7gju4,Tragically Hip in Canada (and border towns like where I am in Buffalo)
s7gju4,"It baffles me how Billy Strings isn't more known in the UK.   
There's people who are seriously into their music who know him, but a lot of people when I mention his name are completely unaware of him."
s7gju4,Aslan are a great Irish band that never gained popularity anywhere else due the simple fact that they don't want to leave Ireland
s7gju4,I‚Äôm in the states and always sorta enjoyed Mental As Anything (in the ‚Äò80‚Äôs but I have yet to talk to anyone who has heard of them‚Ä¶are they well known in Australia?
s7gju4,"Someone already said it but The Tragically Hip, along with others like Blue Rodeo üá®üá¶"
s7gju4,Am American but have visited the UK and James had one hit here in the states (Laid) in the mid 90s but that was basically it.  In the UK I'm pretty sure they're a much bigger deal.  Also over here Blur is pretty much only known for Song 2.
s7gju4,"Being an Aussie we have a bunch of local legends who the rest of the world would say ""Who the fuck""

* The Superjesus
* The Cruel Sea
* Beasts of Bourbon
* You Am I
* Killing Heidi
* Magic Dirt
* The Living End
* Wicked Beat Sound System
* Cold Chisel
* Jimmy Barnes (Also singer for Cold Chisel)
* Midnight Oil
* Hilltop Hoods
* Regurgitator
* Paul Kelly
* Powderfinger
* Grinspoon

Note: Jimmy Barnes and Cold Chisel are somewhat of an institution here in Oz. EVERYONE knows Jimmy Barnes and Cold Chisel. You'll basically be ejected from the country if you don't sing Khe Sahn or Flame Trees when it comes on anywhere.

Second Note: A lot of these bands/groups are 1980s and perhaps 1990s. Aussie music has really suffered and there's not the talent like there was."
s7gju4,"Pretty sure the rest of the world have no idea about majority of big country artists in America,"
s7gju4,Depeche Mode are WAY bigger outside their native U.K. than in it.
s7gju4,"Airbag!

Huge in Norway. Not really known anywhere else. They have very strong Pink Floyd vibes. Great band!"
s7gju4,"Soda Stereo. They were huge in Latin America, but the rest of the world dissect know about them.

I dare to say it was the most important rock band of the continent (in Spanish)

Here's a clip of her last tour with all three members, in 2007:

https://youtu.be/eguctGjUNLI"
s7gju4,subway to salley isn apparently big in europe and no one in the U.S knows about them.
s7gju4,Apulanta - Finland
s7gju4,"In college, I was a musician and played some shows with a few guys that were all part of a band called Midlake.  They also own a bar there that was a great local hang.  

Apparently, they are pretty big in Europe but I'd say they are relatively unknown here in the United States.  Can anyone confirm?"
s7gju4,"Ah, Dope D.O.D..and actually bring me the horizon"
s7gju4,"Although I'd love to believe that's not the case, I'm fairly confident Sharmoofers is only known in Egypt. You're all missing out."
s7gju4,"Homebrew, Six60, and Dave Dobbyn in NZ"
s7gju4,The British electronic/rock band Archive are pretty big in France and Belgium but no one in their own country knows who they are.
s7gju4,"Dave Matthews is massive in the US. He‚Äôs known elsewhere for sure, but not in nearly the same capacity."
s7gju4,"Royal Republic are a Swedish band that fly under the radar pretty much everywhere else apart from Germany I believe. I found out about them during a trip to Sweden and they were playing on the radio on a regular bus. Blew me away immediately and I was furiously googling who they were and why Swedish buses played awesome radio. Pretty sure they were topping charts there (at least rock ones, not sure about general charts), yet virtually nobody has heard of them in the UK and their last tour here was mostly relegated to tiny university venues. Zero chart presence. I don't think they have much exposure in the US either.

One of my absolute favourite bands though. Crazy energy and banging tracks. Seems a small section of fans discovered them from an old F1 game soundtrack. Out of all the random obscure bands I like to recommend people, Royal Republic stand out as one that actually sticks with most."
s7gju4,"Anathema, not your average Liverpool band!"
s7gju4,"Rodriguez, of Sugar Man fame. He's from Detroit, but was not very well known at all in America.   


He was famous in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. bizarrely he had no idea. He was just living in obscurity in Detroit for the longest time"
s7gju4,"David Hasslehof. Everyone in Germany knows his songs, Americans are just confused when you bring up his ""music""."
s7gju4,the tragically hip. thank god i have Canadian friends who clued me in
s7gju4,3 Doors Down. They've barely dented the UK charts in their 22-year career.
s7gju4,Powderfinger
s7gju4,"_Seona Dancing_ made [the song that represented the 80s for the Philippines](https://youtu.be/vo_4xcZ4_As) and then dipped


The vocalist was Ricky Gervais."
s7gju4,"I've never heard of Biffy Clyro, but I have to say that is the most Britishest band name I've ever heard."
s7gju4,"My favorite band (STS9) is a popular jam band in the United States, the band is 20+ years old, i have seen them 83 times, they sell out red rocks and other multiple venues often.. my dad always asks ‚Äúwhy is it that this band is you and everyone you know‚Äôs everything, yet if I ask any John Doe on the street they‚Äôve never even heard of the band?‚Äù Yeah idk.  But if you‚Äôre reading this, look them up. Lol"
s7gju4,"Modern Talking.

A West-German, English language 80's pop band that was incredibly popular in Europe and the former Soviet Union. They were right up there with Wham, Duran Duran and A-Ha in terms of air play.

Mostly unheard of in the US."
s7gju4,Not necessarily a country thing but the band Our Lady Peace has a big following in Canada and the Northern US.  They rarely venture to the lower parts of the US though and have only had 1-2 songs get radio time down here
s7gju4,"Canada, tragically hip"
s7gju4,"When I moved to Germany from the UK a fair number of people asked me if I liked ""The Kelly Family"". I'd never heard of them but they sold 20 million albums in Europe and were ranked as the 6th most popular music act in Germany in the 1990s."
s7gju4,"a-ha. 

One of the greatest bands of the 80s, but if you are American, you think they're a one-hit wonder who just got lucky when they did ""Take on Me."" They were huge just about everywhere else, and still hold the world record for one of the biggest live audiences ever from one of their shows in the 90s. 

They're also pretty dysfunctional, and not as good as when Paul and Magne were writing together, but they have 30 years of amazing music to explore. Turn the lights down, put on Memorial Beach or Minor Earth, Major Sky, and enjoy all the moodiness to its fullest extent."
s7gju4,"Phish. Outside of the states and even in the states, they are not recognized or known how awesome they are. Ommm pa pa ommm pa paaaa!

13 shows in a row at Maddison Square Garden didn‚Äôt repeat a single song. What band can do that?"
s7gju4,"There‚Äôs this punk band from Japan named Hi-Standard. They‚Äôre huge in their home country and apparently fill up arenas there. But even in the punk community, they‚Äôre a completely obscure/unknown band elsewhere. They‚Äôre signed to Fat Wreck Chords but never really made a name for themselves here"
s7gju4,Concrete Blonde came close to topping the charts here in Australia with their single Joey in 1990. It still gets lots of radio play here. Their album Bloodletting made the top 10 in Australia but barely made the top 50 in their homeland USA. I think they are even less known in the UK.
s7gju4,Marianas Trench. A buddy of mine and I (American) are huge fans since Masterpiece Theater and have never understood why they don‚Äôt get more traction here. It‚Äôs even ‚Äúfunnier‚Äù that Josh Ramsey (lead singer for MT) wrote (or co-wrote) ‚ÄúCall Me Maybe‚Äù with Carley Rae Jepsen and that‚Äôs been his biggest hit in the US.
s7gju4,"When i was a month in ireland over 10 years ago i was suprised nobody knew the band "" Flogging Molly""."
s7gju4,"They aren't together anymore but Great Big Sea was huge in Canada and virtually unknown in the US. Great band.

 Cover of REMs *End of the World* played live.
https://youtu.be/3eC1sFrQkKo

Seen them several times in concert and enjoyed it every time, including one that's still my ATF concert experience, where we bumped into the band at bar after the show and had drinks with them for an hour or two."
s7gju4,I'd say *Muse* has a terrific following in most of the cultured world outside the US.
s7gju4,Czerwone Gitary in Poland
s7gju4,"I think The Ramones are an example of that.
As far as I know, they were massive in Argentina back in the day, as in playing in arenas big, while they had crowds of a couple of hundreds anywhere else, though I don't know their story too well so I may be wrong."
s7gju4,Sticky fingers - australia
s7gju4,Kings of leon
s7gju4,"Robin sparkles isn‚Äôt well known outside Canada 

https://youtu.be/rtMR524m0BM she was big in the 90s not wait legen wait for it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..


Derry"
s7gju4,"The Kinks didn't really get the international exposure they deserved. 
Easily up there with The Beatles and Stones."
s7gju4,T√©l√©phone. Most famous French rock band. Unknown anywhere else.
s7gju4,"when i went to colombia i found out people there don‚Äôt really listen to Shakira, despite the fact that she‚Äôs colombian.

edit: i stand corrected, germans do really listen to rammstein."
s7gju4,I like some Argentinian rock bands that are big Argentina but mostly unknown in Spanish-speaking United States.
s7gju4,"2 Minutos an Argentinean Punk band, Mexican/Colombian/Chilean punks love them, and they're known here but not that much in comparison to some other Argentinean punk bands like Attaque77"
s7gju4,"I dunno if it counts, but it seems lie Van Halen is way way less popular in europe as it is in the US."
s7gju4,Southern All Stars from Japan and Viagra Boys from Sweden. I could be wrong though.
s7gju4,"Very much known Brazilian band (atleast, only in Brazil) called Mamonas Assassinas, everybody loved them there, I am not from there, but heard of them via their plane-crash, accompanied with pictures... Tragic."
s7gju4,Leningrad are a brilliant ska band from Russia. Look them up on You Tube lots of live concerts and music videos.
s7gju4,The Projj is unknown in the US
s7gju4,"mon the biff

wish they were bigger here"
s7gju4,Kaizers Orchestra - Norway
s7gju4,"TDK, big in Bulgaria, barely got a hundred people in Berlin"
s7gju4,Ava max
s7gju4,"Aphrodite's Child. 

Jazz Butcher Conspiracy. 

Kazuyoshi Nakamura/ 100's.

Boney M."
s7gju4,Mexico's Mana
s7gju4,"Rush
April wine
‚Ä¶almost all Canadian bands"
s7gju4,Scrolling through Reddit one day I saw a video of Minds of 99. I have no idea who they are but they have some really huge shows where they‚Äôre from.
s7gju4,"Violent Soho from Australia. Hugely popular there, barely a word about them here in the states."
s7gju4,Nomeansno.  one of the greatest bands of all time.
s7gju4,L.A.B. - Katchafire
s7gju4,"Exactly. Biffy was my first response. Rock Gods in the UK and Europe, hardly anyone I know here in the states knows them. I actually say them an an opener for Manchester Orchestra in a small club in Chapel Hill NC, but they still brought it like it was a stadium."
s7gju4,Check out the documentary Finding Sugarman!
s7gju4,"*Anglosphere flex intensifies*
Coughing in Russian/Hebrew 
For the Electronic music lovers I suggest Infected Mushroom and Skazi they both tried to escape the small israeli domestic market, IM moved to LA Skazi not so much."
s7gju4,Manowar
s7gju4,The movie Searching for Sugarman is about an American folk rocker named Rodriguez who didn‚Äôt even know he was famous - because he was only famous in South Africa. Now you can hear his songs at Chipotle.
s7gju4,"A lot of smaller subgenres of EDM aren't as lucrative here in the US. 
You'll see artists like Angerfist and other hardcore/harddance DJS have massive crowds at festivals and big clubs in Europe and Australia. 
I saw Angerfist in U Street Music Hall in DC, probably less than 70 people in the whole venue. Other big DJs dont even get booked."
s7gju4,I listen to a metal band called Mustasch. They are from Sweden and have won several Grammy awards in their home country.  Big in Sweden and Finland.
s7gju4,"A lot from Ireland don‚Äôt make it outside the Irish/UK bubble some of my favourites are 

Mick Flannery (folk/acoustic), 
Delorentos (Indie Rock/Pop), 
Denise Chaila (Hip Hop), although she‚Äôs relatively new so she might break out . 
Daith√≠ (Electronic/EDM)"
s7gju4,"I know no one who knew –ê–≥–∞—Ç–∞ –ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏ outside of Eastern Europe, yet their musics are so good. Do yourself a favor and copy paste –ö–∞–∫ –ù–∞ –í–æ–π–Ω–µ on YouTube.

They are hugely popular in Russia and some other Russian speaking countries, yet seemingly non existent elsewhere."
s7gju4,"Most ‚Äúhip hop‚Äù artists from the US, the rest of the world does not know most of them.."
s7gju4,"Mumiy Troll in Russia.  Stadium rock huge, but not known anywhere else.  Also vladimir vysotsky,  he's like Russias Bob Dylan.  I like his music too. Really unique and a helluva cool voice.  There is also this band from nepal called 1979 or 1989. I can't quite remember."
s7gju4,Millennium got play here in the late 90s but I haven‚Äôt heard it in probably a decade. I couldn‚Äôt name another song of his.
s7gju4,Surprisingly the band Interpol had a HUGE following in Mexico. They didn‚Äôt get as big over here in the states
s7gju4,"From what I‚Äôve heard Kylie minogue isn‚Äôt very popular in America, which just seems crazy to me."
s7gju4,"Max Webster made a song with fucking Rush (called Battle Scar) but they're barely known outside of Canada. Their frontman, Kim Mitchell, had a minor hit in the US with his solo song ""Go For A Soda"" which is featured in an episode of American Dad."
s7gju4,A lot of Japanese bands have HYUUUUGE international fanbase that has to travel to Japan because touring outside the country wouldn't be economically viable. Malice Mizer came to mind
s7gju4,"Not exactly ‚Äúone country,‚Äù but Falco was a bona fide superstar across Europe, especially in his home country of Austria.  However, people across the pond only really know him as the novelty act that did ‚ÄúRock Me Amadeus.‚Äù  He was even the co-writer and original performer of the song ‚ÄúDer Kommissar,‚Äù which became a top 10 hit in the States for the band After the Fire.

Edit: Also just realized the language barrier thing mentioned above does apply here, but think he‚Äôs still worth mentioning as he did have a number 1 hit in the USA that would define everyone‚Äôs image of him there."
s7gju4,Cliff Richard
s7gju4,Still don‚Äôt understand why David Hasselhoff it‚Äôs so highly regarded in Germany. For his singing.
s7gju4,Nobody knows Trifuk
s7gju4,Fokofpolisiekar - big in South Africa
s7gju4,Trifuk
s7gju4,I (UK) came across Seu Jorge during 2021. Apparently he's massive in Brazil. No one I know knows him apart from the mate who recommended him. He's really good regardless. Any brazillians confirm?
s7gju4,"As far as I know, Elbow is popular in the UK but I've never heard anyone talk about them in the US."
s7gju4,I believe Triumph was fairly big in Canada and had minimal radio play in the U.S
s7gju4,I'd say Keane. They're big in the  UK but not well known in the US. Coldplay is what Keane should've been in America.
s7gju4,"Bonnaroo 2006, I was talking to a couple that had flown over to Australia to attend the festival.  They were going on and on about how great Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were but had never heard of them before that show."
s7gju4,"Modern Talking never made it in the USA, but were huge in Europe in the 80's"
s7gju4,Does anyone outside of Manchester give a toss about Courteeners? They play stadiums there but even down south it's more mid-sized venues. Can't imagine they have much of a presence outside the UK.
s7gju4,Arkells in Canada
s7gju4,"Shunno,Ever heard about it?"
s7gju4,"Garth Brooks, in ireland.  There is a whole lifestyle around him."
s7gju4,One massively famous Australian artist that never seemed to make it out of Australia is John Farnham.
s7gju4,"For the longest time, Def Leppard were virtually unknowns in their own country yet tearing it up in Europe and the US"
s7gju4,Angel City ( Australia)
s7gju4,Jaguares from Mexico. One of my all time favorites.
s7gju4,SNFU ( CANADA)
s7gju4,Frank Turner headlined at Wembley and I saw him recently at a US club with about 200 people max.
s7gju4,"Man-O-War, from the US, no one here knows them.  Huge in Europe and South America."
s7gju4,"What do you mean? It's like most of the music! 

Most countries have their local musical traditions and most of it is unknown outside of the country."
s7gju4,"Moxy, Crash Test Dummies, April Wine especially, they didn‚Äôt get their first big hit until 1978 with Roller"
s7gju4,Cold Chisel in Australia. My Australian fried used to rave about these guys. He said they toured America once and were treated so badly they basically said f'em and never bothered with the US again.
s7gju4,Robbie Williams in the UK/EU. I had never heard of him until I was overseas and turned on the television in my hotel.
s7gju4,Deacon Blue in Scotland
s7gju4,"Josh Ritter has a small to mid-sized but passionate fan base here in the US, but I believe he‚Äôs got a big following in Ireland üáÆüá™"
s7gju4,King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
s7gju4,Guano Apes
s7gju4,Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think Life Of Agony are quite big in the USA? Over here in the UK i saw them a few years back at an 800 capacity venue....there were about 150 people there
s7gju4,"**De Staat** is currently one of the most famous Dutch acts. They make awesome music with a bit of a circus-esque vibe. But more importantly; they are absolute showmen. They have these shticks they do for each song like the [Witch Doctor circle pit](https://youtu.be/p5TzXy9_CMs&t=3m), the [Help Yourself camcorder bit](https://youtu.be/xDu9heoMfl0&t=23m30s), or the [Make Way For The Passenger visuals](https://youtu.be/xDu9heoMfl0&t=42m03s).

s800bt,We will always love you? Never heard. Are you talking about Dolly Parton song I will always love you?
s84td5,The link isnt working for me idk why
s7itnc,I personally like Dollys better
s7itnc,I agree up until the verse Dolly chooses to speak rather than sing (‚ÄúI hope life treats you kind‚Ä¶‚Äù). That part sounds more like Dolly is reading a Hallmark card out loud. Compare that to Whitney‚Äôs vocal performance of that same verse where she absolutely slays those lines and then goes into a dramatic key change??
s7itnc,"Whitney technically sang the song better (higher, more sustained notes, etc.) but it's not just a song when Dolly does it. The old saying goes, you have to live the blues to truly sing the blues, Dolly lived this song. When Dolly sings ""I Will Always Love You"", you feel it in every breath."
s7itnc,"I spent a lot of years working in country radio, and can name quite a few songs that were bigger hits for other artists than the one who wrote it in the first place.

That happens a lot.  Another thing that happens often is that the artist who gets the first crack at the song is eclipsed by someone else who has a huge hit with it.

One thing I've heard over and over again from country artists?  

""The song is the thing.""

When a songwriter like Dolly (or anyone of the multitude of writers in Nashville) puts a song out there, they're releasing it into the world to see where it will go.  Maybe it will get put ""on hold"" by George Strait.  Maybe it will be that big record for Garth Brooks.  Maybe their own version of it will not quite hit number one, but will live long enough in airplay and sales to put their kids through college.  

Whatever happens, the song is still the thing.  It has a life of it's own, and if it turns out to be a huge hit for a pop singer, then you're proud of it for that fact.  Dolly is cool enough to set her ego aside (if she even has one) and say ""Whitney sang the hell out of my song, sold millions of records, and everyone remembers it over mine.  You go girl.""

Asking ""who really sang it better"" misses the point."
s7itnc,"Oddly enough, my coworker was talking about both of these songs yesterday. He‚Äôs a diehard metalhead and old biker type, and he said the Whitney Houston version gives him chills but the Dolly Parton version makes him cry because he thinks it‚Äôs that good. I personally love both songs."
s7itnc,"Dolly‚Äôs version, to me, seems like it‚Äôs coming from someone that‚Äôs accepted what‚Äôs happening but is trying to suppress the full scope of their sadness. It definitely feels like someone saying goodbye. Whitney‚Äôs version, however, fully displays the powerful emotions that come with heartbreak. She doesn‚Äôt hold back at all. They are both amazing interpretations of the lyrics and can show how different people handle their feelings. I think they‚Äôre equally amazing. 

I definitely disagree that Whitney‚Äôs version was ‚Äòjust‚Äô made to show off her voice. She had an amazing voice, why shouldn‚Äôt she use it?"
s7itnc,[This guy](https://youtu.be/3xh6fxaQkm8)
s7itnc,"I thought Dolly's version was softer. Almost like a shy, demure little girl. And I think that shows from her point-of-view. scared of an uncertain future without Porter Waggoner... being young and maybe a little na√Øve... being brave to know that she wants to try new things. 

I thought Whitney Houston's version was more bolder. More in-your-face. More matter-of-fact. More ""and what are you going to do about it? I love you."" I never saw the movie, so I don't really know where Whitney's motivation comes from."
s7itnc,"They're both great, but I have to give the slight edge to Dolly..

Did you know that she wrote ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""Jolene"" the same night? As a songwriter that blows my mind!"
s7itnc,Whitney Houston absolutely killed it. Yes it gets overplayed. But it‚Äôs a genuinely amazing rendition. Even Dolly admits Whitney‚Äôs version is better
s7itnc,Whitney Houston as for me
s7itnc,"I agree Dolly conveyed the emotion better in her vocal, though Whitney‚Äôs vocal is of course a powerhouse, so while they‚Äôre both great in different ways, to me the Whitney version had the bigger ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù factor. To me another great strength the Whitney version had over the original is the arrangement. So my pick is Houston‚Äôs."
s7itnc,"Whitney‚Äôs is impressive. It gives me chills and goosebumps. It‚Äôs so beautiful and powerful.

Dolly‚Äôs however is important. You feels what she is singing is important. You can feel what she feels and you remember the time when you felt it in your life."
s7itnc,"Whitney Houston but who cares, you already made up your mind"
s7itnc,Hands down ... Dolly
s7itnc,"Whitney fucking killed it, but Dolly OWNED it.

Dolly for the win."
s7itnc,Team Dolly
s7itnc,Dolly all the way
s7itnc," 'Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it?   


It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but ""The Greatest Love of All"" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity.  


Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the   
hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's   
impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can   
always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial   
really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.'"
s7itnc,"Whitney sang it better, Dolly put more heart and into it"
s7itnc,"Whitney, when the volume of a worldclass voice is the Parameter."
s7itnc,"Both good for different reasons in different times (both for life and the singer). They are almost completely different songs which shows just how amazing dolly is at writing simple lyrics. I prefer the dolly one but that is just a preference. I can still see why the Whitney one is adorned, just not my taste."
s7itnc,"For many years, I've always thought that Whitney's version was better, but I do feel that Dolly's original version has more ""feeling"" to it, and I agree when you pointed out about Whitney's focus on her vocal. I personally do not feel sadness when listening to Whitney's version. It's more to a farewell, ""let me go, don't worry about me"" song, as oppose to ""I have no choice but letting you go and I'm so sad about it"" song, the feeling I get when listening to Dolly's version."
s7itnc,Even Dolly said that Whitney's version was better
s7itnc,The amazing thing for me is Dolly wrote this song and Joleen on the same day. That is some serious talent.
s7itnc,"Houston's phrasing was so much better. Her three measure hold on the ""I"" makes the last four words fit the melody better. Dolly is a songwriter first, but Whitney was a vocal phenomenon. My favorite covers have been country-ish with Houston's phrasing.

I do hate the unnecessary key change, though."
s7itnc,Linda Ronstadt for me.
s7itnc,Whitney
s7itnc,Dolly's original qnd more understated version is better. Whitney's version made my worst hit songs of 1992 list...thats how much I absolutely cannot stand it.
s7itnc,"Whitney may have had the technically better voice, but Dolly had the soul. You can hear the vulneralbility and sadness in Dolly's version. No contest!"
s7itnc,"Dolly.

Smashing people over the head with high decibel sound until their ears bleed is not ""conveying emotion""."
s7itnc,"Whitney‚Äôs arrangement was written to be ‚Äúthe big song‚Äù near the end of the movie, as has happened in movies before and since.  It‚Äôs a showcase performance piece.

Dolly‚Äôs hit #1 on the country charts twice, but Whitney‚Äôs was #1 for 14 weeks and sold over 20 million copies.  It has made so many ‚Äúbest ever (whatever) songs‚Äù that it‚Äôs just ridiculous.

I‚Äôm with the herd on this one.  The vocals are amazing and the arrangement is superb.

When Dolly sings it now, she‚Äôs thinking of Whitney.  9 cents (writer‚Äôs royalty) for every copy sold, whether single, album, video, or whatever.  That put several million dollars in Dolly‚Äôs pocket."
s7itnc,"I never liked Whitney‚Äôs version. As has been said, it‚Äôs a show off vocal performance and it‚Äôs impressive in that regard, but I never thought it fit the song. The overpowering voice doesn‚Äôt fit the vulnerable nature of the song. 

Dolly‚Äôs fit it perfectly though, to the point where she‚Äôs damn nearly breaking down in tears at the end, in her re-recorded version."
s7itnc,"Dolly all the way.  Whitney belts it out in an attempt to overly emote it.. too far.  Dolly beaks my heart, Whitney doesn't."
s7itnc,"Is the point of this that you just wanted to trash Huston's version according to your very specific definition of ""better""?"
s7itnc,I will go to my grave defending the fact that Dolly wins this hands down.
s7itnc,Whitney just belts that chorus out 100% from the first verse.  There's no build-up at all.  Kinda makes you think she didn't know why the song worked...... I said after her single sold a billion copies.
s7itnc,"The Dolly Parton and its not even close. The Whitney Houston caterwauling does nothing for me, I really dislike that version."
s7itnc,"I agree with your assessment, OP."
s7itnc,"I don‚Äôt really know, but I like your post. I will check out both versions side by side."
s7itnc,Leavelle - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=feA3TZ12UnE
s7itnc,"Songs like this... or hurt by trent or even Jeff buckleys hallelujah... these are all master class in emotional songwriting... and there are alot of fantastic songs written from the heart... but some times someone hears a perfectly written song and it speaks to them in a way where they almost seem to have more passion for the words written then the written did. This is how I feel about these songs as well as cancer written by Gerard way of mcr but covered by twenty one pilots. 
In summation,  all these songs were perfect as written yet some how were made more perfecter by thier covering artist being so attached to the words...
My 2 cents."
s7itnc,Lzzy Hale
s7itnc,Dolly Parton's version is a million times better.  It has softness.  It has space.  It has pathos.  The beauty of her version is the simplicity of it.
s7itnc,"I think this is a song where there's been several great versions that I've heard. The three that stand out are Dolly's, Whitney Houston's and Chris Cornell's.

I think they all bring something to the table and beyond just personal opinion I don't know if it's worth  debating which one is best.  I personally love everything Cornell has done and am kind of biased towards that one. That said, Dolly wrote a phenomenal song and one may call the spoken verse  ""Hallmark"" but it drove home a personal attachment to it.  Whitney's version is just a pure testament to vocal power and has some really huge notes in it.  It really becomes very sonorous (to slip in a more than slightly pretentious word)"
s7itnc,"I like Dolly, but I like Whitney's version better."
s7itnc,"Whitney Houston, Dolly Parton is gross"
s7itnc,Dolly for me. Can‚Äôt stand Houston‚Äôs demonstrative singing.
s7itnc,Racially motivated.
s7itnc,Well its absolute shite. But you'd have to give it to  Dolly Parton seeing its rightfully hers.
s7i2zv,"Maybe it‚Äôs a myth, but I‚Äôve seen it quoted a few times from Duane where he says something like ‚ÄúDickey is the good one, I‚Äôm the famous one.‚Äù 

Dickey doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for his skill. He writes incredible melodies and can harmonize like nobody‚Äôs business."
s7i2zv,Probably one of the greatest live songs ever recorded. Duane and Dickey playing some of their best guitar solos and the entire band is in sync.

s83su6,"Cool riff! 

As it turns out, that video is probably throwing you off and making you second guess your own ear: he's actually playing a baritone guitar, which has the strings tuned much lower than your guitar. 

So on your guitar, you can still play exactly what he's playing, but you just need to do so five frets lower.

So: 

Easy answer:

On a standard tuned guitar, the riff is made up of typical powerchords, and goes like this (if you'll forgive my low-rent tab skills):

> D: x577xx  B: x244xx, D: x577xx  C#: x466xx

> F#: 244xxx A: 577xxx, A: 577xxx B: 799xxx

> D: x577xx B: x244xx, E: x799xx C#: x466xx

> F#: 244xxx, A: 577xxx, A: 577xxx B: 799xxx

(And repeat a second time).


More precise answer:

I don't have a guitar hooked up to properly check, but looking at the video, he might be playing slightly different voicings beyond simply the powerchords I tabbed above: by playing an additional ""fifth"" as the lowest note in the chord. You'll hear that this thickens up the sound, but it might sound odd when you're playing by yourself (it can sometimes need the other instruments to balance it, so the above version might be more enjoyable).



> D: 5577xx  B: 2244xx, D: 5577xx  C#: 4466xx

> F#: 244xxx A: 577xxx, A: 0022xx B: 2244xx

> D: 5577xx  B: 2244xx, E: 7799xx  C#: 4466xx

> F#: 244xxx A: 577xxx, A: 0022xx B: 2244xx

I'm also not 100% sure if the notes on the g string are played (e.g. that tab would start as 557xxx, etc, etc, etc) - try it and see!


Edit: in relation to playing style, this is a great one to try and keep an ear out for what he's doing in relation to slides (especially on the recorded version in the last repeat): what chords are being slid between? What is the feel of it? Is he sliding early into chords, or sliding late into them?"

s82ebj,"Funk has always been such an incredible forward looking genre. So much if it still sounds ahead of its time even today. George Clinton's [Atomic Dog](https://youtu.be/LuyS9M8T03A) is one that continues to stand out for me. Dotto for the proto-mashup [Man's Best friend/Loopzilla](https://youtu.be/VpQvD0fMUHk). And, there isn't a moment lost of Prince's 1999 either. It's hard to boil down to a single track, but [D.S.M.R](https://youtu.be/1f6ZlD3vuKw) has a solid mix of the album's churning cauldron of sex appeal, experimentalism, pop sensibilities and dance beats.

80s-90s thrash metal still sounds incredibly cutting edge to me too. It's like several decades of metal's evolution were lept right over by going from Judas Priest and Iron Maiden to Metallica and Megadeth. I'd probably go with Megadeth's [Holy Wars](https://youtu.be/J5o8Daw1ZsY) circa 1990 and Metallica's [Master of Puppets](https://youtu.be/0obBdrfUMzU) circa 1986.

A more modern sound that utterly defies pigeon holing in time is French Touch. They've gone an plundered the treasures of the 70s and 80s and reworked it with modern production and spit back out the most eminently polished and tasteful pop we could imagine. Justice's Woman and Daft Punk's RAM are probably the epitome. Again picking single tracks is difficult. I suppose I'd have to go with [Get Lucky](https://youtu.be/D2f6lNmmd1M) because it will be played until the sun explodes and [Randy](https://youtu.be/hw3d9KTYHIE) for its anthemic qualities, but these are by no means the only timeless tracks on those albums, or by those bands or in that genre. A lesser known gem would be L'Imp√©ratrice's [Agitations Tropicales](https://youtu.be/jda_k6r9R1A). I'll have to go back to Daft Punk for my favourite track of them all, [Digital Love](https://youtu.be/4whD6uAryMs).

s7d566,"I am a major admirer of Peter Gabriel's solo career, but I can't stand Genesis. They tick off absolutely every box in the ""prog rock is for weird, nerdy losers"" checklist. I also firmly believe that the person of Phil Collins represents everything that is antithetical to rock and roll but will admit that he was an excellent drummer back in the day.  His drum work on Brian Eno's *Another Green World* and the *Brand X* jazz fusion album are truly remarkable."

s7viv7,"If you're talking about the studio version on *Bleach* (which I assume you are, because the *Unplugged* version is on an electric-acoustic): I'd say he was clearly not using overdrive/using only a small amount of gain and probably set his pickups to the mid-position or possibly the neck position, while using low levels of bass and higher levels of mids and treble to get the jangly, Byrds-style guitar tone. For the solo, it sounds like he added moderate levels of gain/overdrive and switched his pickups to the lead/bridge position, which gives it more bite and sharpness, which gives it more of a ""lead guitar"" sound."
s7viv7,"Well, he wasn‚Äôt playing the jag-stang on about a girl. That‚Äôs a custom model guitar that he designed with fender once he became a huge star. Which would be after Nevermind came out.

s88f76,"American here: In my experience, it depends upon the artist and venue. 

For The Who's farewell tour, I noticed most of their fans were retirement age. The place was packed, but most people were sitting down. 

The most recent Nine Inch Nails concert I went to (pre-Covid), the venue had no seats. Everyone was packed up against the rails, standing.

In the end, on average (again, in my experience): The people closest to the stage are the ones standing, and the people further back are usually sitting down--assuming there are seats in which to do so."
s88f76,"Devils advocate American music nerd here, but for a genius band like Tool, I would love to sit and watch the masters at work, contemplate the screen, the band members, the music. Tool has a lot going on at their shows, I get really cerebral listening to them. I wouldn‚Äôt be there to mosh around with a bunch of idiot strangers. I just want that experience to myself.

Edit: by the way, I hope you loved the show! They are amazing."
s88f76,I'm American and all the venues I've been to weren't sitting down except for one and nobody sat down anyway. It was just in a stadium. But that's just me
s88f76,We can't afford to injure ourselves at one.
s88f76,"Most venues in Canada do the same thing. Primarily stadium shows. I haven‚Äôt been to a single big name concert that didn‚Äôt have seating. Granted I always get floor tickets so I can stand and mosh, but actual seating at concerts is pretty common place in the west."
s88f76,They stand on their feet at work all day.
s88f76,I just saw Tool and everyone was standing. I don't think your experience is universal.
s88f76,"It depends on where you go. In the Illinois and Missouri venues I‚Äôve been to, people stand up and some of them even mosh. I‚Äôd always stand and sing/jump/dance. Moshing is a little too much for me. And if there was seating I would sit at times especially if it was an all day music festival and I was hot and tired and needed a break. 


You‚Äôve just been going to the wrong venues.


Also people make a lot of good points about people wanting to sit down, study the music, and just enjoy it. In my early twenties, I was all about going nuts at shows. Now that I‚Äôm in my thirties, I just want to enjoy the music. I hurt everywhere all of the time and I don‚Äôt necessarily care about standing up the entire time. You don‚Äôt have to stand and be super energetic to enjoy music and I think even the artists who play the shows know this. It‚Äôs just like the times I‚Äôve been to orchestras or symphonies. I‚Äôd much rather sit at those concerts too because I‚Äôm so focused on getting lost in the music."
s88f76,"my last concert was a tool concert as well but back in 2019 anyway there were alot of ppl who just sat there including myself too. for me it felt like a great show which someone should carefully watch... like if tool would be a drink it would be wine. well balanced as all things should be. i think its one way to enjoy a show and its nothing wrong with that... i did the crowd thing when i was younger, now i'll do the sitting thing"
s88f76,"I went to see tool a few years ago. Everyone in the entire ducking arena was standing, except for one asshole behind me. He was all coked up and kept pushing me out of the way so he could see the show. The only dude sitting and he was behind me. I have the best luck"
s88f76,Ummm‚Ä¶. Astroworld?
s88f76,This is why I don't go to concerts with assigned seats.  Usually general admission only for me.

s74vvl,Huge Cure fan. This is one of my favorite songs. Also a great album
s74vvl,My favorite album by The Cure ever‚Ä¶ this song is amazing.
s7dzkn,Or you could just not listen to them before the album drops?
s7dzkn,agree. should be one single when the album is announced and one single a week before the album drop. anything more is excessive
s7dzkn,"While I agree with you, I gotta say this from the perspective of the musician: last year, we released a single in anticipation of a 5-track, so basically 20% of the record was out there. The traction that Single gained was insane. It increased monthly streams tenfold and boosted sales incredibly.

The reason this is done is simply because it works a charm. Especially in an era where everybody can release music in some form, you can not compete with the sheer amount of records coming out. It is a sad reality that you have to play the algorithm if you want to get noticed, all the more when playing live is impossible.

Some people claim that the album is dead anyway and one should insted release singles digitally and at the End of the year slap them all together, put an overall mastering on it and have yourself a physical compilation.

This of course does not apply to concept albums and of course you don't have to play the game. It just makes it a whole lot easier, like I couldn't believe it."
s7dzkn,"The age of streaming brought this upon us. Every album song released separately is another chance to get the algorithm going, with all single plays then adding up for the album statistic."
s7dzkn,"I wish bands still released singles as stand-alones, like The Beatles did. Those singles usually did not appear on full length albums.  The Smiths were pretty good at using this model of releasing non-album singles, too. Makes it more interesting for a collector."
s7dzkn,"I've decided for myself the best way to avoid this is to just not listen to anything from the album before release. I don't use spotify and if I hear something on the radio I'm waiting for I just change it. I want to hear it all together, I like to listen to albums from start to finish. If it's a true single (like a holiday song or a random release between albums) then cool I'll take it.

Then again, I've reached a point in my life where most of my artists aren't on the radio anymore so it's easier to not spoil them that way."
s7dzkn,"It's a relic of a time where people were *forced* to appreciate albums in order to hear the songs they liked. A shitton of those people would never really appreciate the medium (longform sequences of songs, that is) if it wasn't forced on them. A sad reality, I guess."
s846k3,"Oasis saved rock n' roll, man. They made that 60s sound mega again for a good decade."
s846k3,"Not at all. Rock was never dead, and it certainly wasn't saved by a bunch of kids who did their best to sound like the Velvet Underground.   


I'm pretty sure Velvet Revolver and Foo Fighters did more to keep rock in the public eye than The Strokes did."
s846k3,"They saved **nothing**.  Not hating on them.  The album was OK, and it was memorable when contrasted with most of the garbage that record companies were churning out at that time, but in the grand scheme of things it was not some momentous achievement.

I will give them credit where it‚Äôs due: Mr. Brightside is a good song and makes for a good stadium anthem."
s846k3,"I don't think so, tbh. Cool band, specially their first album, thats all."
s846k3,"I just checked the Billboard US music charts, and 2001 saw No.1 albums by several rock acts: Dave Matthews Band, Tool, Staind, Blink-182, System of a Down, and Creed. So I'd say rock was doing okay."
s846k3,Lol.  Is this a troll post?
s846k3,"Not hating on them either but I never really got into them. I know nobody personally that liked them either.  I realize my sample size is extremely small but I doubt they had much to do with ""saving"" rock. There was other stuff I was more into back then that kept rock going for me."
s846k3,"it's such a clich√©, saying x-genre is ""dying"" or ""fading away"".  Music on the radio is boring anyway.  Do people actually listen to radio still? how can they stand it? The Strokes are okay for being signed to a major record label (RCA) but they're nothing to write home about."
s846k3,They def didn't save rock but their first 2 albums are good listens.
s846k3,Meet me in the bathroom is a great read on this exact subject
s846k3,Britpop was finished so the British press looked to the USA for a new photogenic band to hype and put on all their magazine covers.
s846k3,"Meh. Guitar was still a big thing when the strokes did their album. They were near the front of the mainstream ‚Äúgarage rock revival‚Äù, but they didn‚Äôt have any staying power. The white stripes feel way more important in retrospect."

  [edit] to be clear: there is a LOT of female talent in music - just not in these two bands."
s7ogpk,My dog likes Credence Clearwater Revival- but he doesn't really have a choice
s6k00r,"well this is a bummer. they had a solid run though, and outlived 90% of the bands from the era."
s6k00r,"Fuck, at least they went out with a bang because the latest album fucking ripped."
s6k00r,"Man. This seems like it's gonna be an ugly, drawn out break up. Fucking love these guys and I hope it gets settled in private and we can see a reunion show in a few years"
s6k00r,"Huge bummer. But those recent social media posts before the end of the year made it pretty obvious this is where it was heading. So happy to have a great discography left in their wake and to have gotten one more banger album before they split. Also happy I saw them one last time in November. Great show but my favorite memory of them will forever be seeing them with Vein, Turnstile, and Angel Dust in '18."
s6k00r,I got to see them live in a little shopping center venue in Pennsylvania when Hot Damn was just released. My favorite show ever. And I chose to stay and work and skipped TID The Season this year. I‚Äôll never forgive myself for this one.
s6k00r,"When gutter phenomenon came out, these guys threw a secret show at the Paul frank HQ in Costa Mesa... Free beer free dodgeball free everytime I die. HOB San Diego I meet my cousin in the pit, end up on stage.
(Insert old age and several shows later)
November '21 Garden Grove I pit their entire set, winded but ALIVE. End up on stage again for their final song map change 

This band has been my favorite band since I was 19. I'm 37 now... RIP ETID"
s6k00r,Bummer ‚Äî I‚Äôve listened to them since burial plot bidding war. Radical is a hell of an album to bow out on.
s6k00r,Every Time I Cry... fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
s6k00r,Never put out a bad album and never got stale. Best in the genre potentially one of the best bands of my generation. Ill miss you dudes
s6k00r,"I didn't go to their most recent show in my city cuz I got the Rona, so much for seeing the next one in March"
s6k00r,"I'm not a fan, but I was really into the song ""It Remembers"" for a while.

Can anyone recommend some onboarding tracks?"
s6k00r,"Drag the lake, you'll find it's full of love"
s6k00r,"This will forever be my favorite music video of theirs:

[Every time I die - Ebolorama ](https://youtu.be/HYM_dT-LD1E)"
s6k00r,"It had been close to 10 years since the last time I saw them live, so I was very excited they were going to be in Detroit in March. My wife and I bought the complete package for the show, all the add-ons like parking, drinks etc. It wasn't super expensive, but it wasn't super cheap either, so I'm really wondering if we'll be able to get a refund. 

Either way, this fucking sucks. I've listened to all of Radical at least 100 times by now and absolutely love the album. I've been a fan since the early 2000's when I was in highschool and I was insanely excited to go downtown and see them, to feel how they made me feel all those years ago. 

No idea what happened, obviously Keith has had some problems, and we'll never *really* know what happened, but this hurts deep."
s6k00r,Hot Damn! That is sad. Floater and Ebolarama are my favorites.
s6k00r,I caught covid at their Xmas show and it ended uo being their last show ever. Totally worth it. This is the worst thing to happen to Western New York since the bills lost 4 super bowls in a row.
s6k00r,arguably the greatest in the scene to do it. fuck.
s6k00r,They will be timeless. What a big loss. I will miss hearing some of the best lyrics of any heavy band.
s6k00r,"The new album is great.

Hope they can work through it and eventually make music again."
s6k00r,Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK. FUUUCK.
s6k00r,R.I.P
s6k00r,"*EVERY TIME I DIE is a loud rock institution committed to leaving every nuanced outpouring of chaotic passion and blissful malcontent all over their records and on the stage. With boiling charisma and unrelenting energy to spare, the Buffalo band manages not one but¬†two¬†near-impossible tasks. They‚Äôve survived two decades as an underground entity cherished for coloring outside the lines, and contrary to most career arcs, continually improving¬†with each successive album as they charge ahead.*

*ETID makes a glorious hardcore-punk noise, alchemized by a swampy summoning of Southern rock‚Äôs coarse poetry. The music swirls beneath sardonic and clever wordplay, a combination cementing them as leaders, not followers. The band is recognized and revered for its anarchic explosiveness, artistic impulsiveness, and approachable camaraderie. It‚Äôs all interwoven with a visceral lack of the usual fucks.¬†Revolver¬†counted 2016‚Äôs¬†Low Teens¬†among the 25 Best Albums of the 2010s, and the follow-up,¬†Radical, is no less revelatory. Once again produced by Will Putney (A Day¬†To¬†Remember, The Ghost Inside, Body Count),¬†Radical¬†is 16 tracks of peak-ETID, including raucous new anthems like ‚ÄúPost-Boredom,‚Äù ‚ÄúPlanet Shit,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Colossal Wreck,‚Äù ‚ÄúDesperate Pleasures,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAWOL.‚Äù*

Nice"
s6k00r,Wtf?? Their last album just came out and it‚Äôs a fucking banger
s6k00r,"Really sad to see such a hard working, well respected, consistently good band go out this way. I hope the legal drama is resolved quickly and they can move on to the next project. More importantly I hope Keith gets the help he needs."
s6k00r,"https://youtu.be/XaU-33gu3DU

This being one of their last things hits a little harder now."
s6k00r,Gutted.
s6k00r,"Good to see the metal scene being talked about in this sub, even if it is sad news. They were one of the best to ever do it, not many bands can say they were together for over 20 years and not put out a bad release. RIP ETID."
s6k00r,Ebolarama !!!
s6k00r,Dang! Going to listen to their whole discography in memory
s6k00r,WTF Keith??
s6k00r,"Well, there goes that fantasy."
s6k00r,Fuck. Been my favorite band for well over a decade now. So many memories listening to their music. This hurts to see.
s6k00r,Anybody have the story on what happened??? It played out online?
s6k00r,"God dammit. I get all good things must come to an end, but this sucks hard. Maybe The Damned Things will resurface, that‚Äôd be cool. Be neat to see them all doing other projects.

I wish all the best to those guys. Here‚Äôs to hoping we see them reunite someday!"
s6k00r,"Wow, this is incredibly sad. One of my favorite bands of all time."
s6k00r,"Man, I only know this band really because the guitarists is the Butcher in AEW.

But looking through Twitter their fans seem a bit... Odd. In the replies to the lead singers post they are comparing him to Britney and calling his brother Jamie Lynne... Wtf guys"
s6k00r,"Fuck, this sucks. Seeing them were some of my favorite live shows ever. Always brought 100% every show."
s6k00r,that fuckin hurts
s6k00r,God damn
s6k00r,What‚Äôs a good album to start listening to them?
s6k00r,They were the reason i went to warped back in the day
s6k00r,Nothing like laying in bed and watching it all unfold last night. Been a fan since hot damn. Seen them more times than I can count in so many states. Just awful. I feel for them because so many of those guys poured their heart and soul into ETID
s6k00r,I am absolutely broken from this. My most listened to band. So much talent.
s6k00r,Got to see em in corpus Christi a few weeks ago. It was meant to be.
s6k00r,Gutted
s6k00r,"Every record of theirs slaps, but still it felt like they had a damn good run and probably did everything they were going to do. The last show of theirs I saw is still one of the loudest I have been to, it just never stopped for a moment."
s6k00r,"Bummer, side note: does anyone know if this is grammatically correct? It make sense for a band like the Beatles to say ‚Äúhave‚Äù but would it be ‚ÄúMetallica have broken up?‚Äù"
s6k00r,biggest piece of shinfo ever
s6k00r,Fuck
s6k00r,I think we all saw this coming.
s6k00r,"I was wearing an ETID shirt yesterday when my buddy who really got me into the band broke the news.  We saw them together many times, and played their stuff when we'd jam, I play guitar he plays drums.  This one really cuts deep.

They always seemed like such a tight knit group, especially the Buckley bro's and Andy, it's heartbreaking to hear that it's come to a legal battle with the boys not talking.  Especially considering they just put out arguably their best album yet, and had just gotten better and better with each release.

I know they had been sitting on this one for awhile while COVID reigned havoc, I wonder if the pandemic caused a lot of inner turmoil and once they finally got it out to tour it the pot boiled over.  Mental health is no joke.

Really hope this can get resolved in a peaceful manner and maybe they can take some time away to refocus."
s6k00r,Who
s6k00r,"Might as well, this scene died a long time ago"
s6k00r,Dang this sucks. Now I gotta Google who they are.
s6k00r,Fuck I was gonna see them next month
s6k00r,I had never heard of them before I went to see Coheed and Cambria and they opened for them. Not exactly my style of music but the put on a heck of a performance and I definitely enjoyed it. Sucks when a band breaks up but they had a good run.
s6k00r,Like 8-9 hours ago I just heard about them going on tour and now they‚Äôre breaking up? :(
s6k00r,Never heard of these guys but the comments here make me wanna give a listen. Where should I start?
s6k00r,Damn I literally just saw them play a show for the first time a couple months ago. It was a fantastic show too
s6k00r,Nooooooooooooooooo
s6k00r,Damn they were still dope after all these years too
s6k00r,Glad I didn't buy tickets to the upcoming tour
s6k00r,I can't believe they were still going. I saw em a couple times about twenty years ago. Man I'm old.
s6k00r,what a shame. RIP!
s6k00r,"‚ÄúThe end isn‚Äôt near, it‚Äôs now‚Äù. üò≠ Thanks for all the amazing music and incredible shows. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
s6k00r,That sucks. I never got to see these guys live despite listening since like 2004. That Low Teens album from a few years ago was pretty damn good too after several years of meh records.
s6k00r,Who?
s6k00r,Tbh I thought they already broke up
s6k00r,Every song of theirs sounded the same
s6k00r,"Hell of a run

Great studio band, terrible live band"
s6k00r,....Whomst?
s6k00r,Have sucked for 20 years. Good riddance.
s64l8s,"I feel this might be one of the major ""gateway"" jazz songs that gets a lot of people into the genre."
s64l8s,5/4
s64l8s,"Dave Brubeck makes me want to drink martinis and wear a smoking jacket. 

I hate martinis and I don't smoke."
s64l8s,"I used to live in Dave Brubeck‚Äôs garage. 

Ok, technically, I lived in an apartment above a garage of the house that my landlord said he built but apparently never lived in because the water was bad.

Still. It was a neat house."
s64l8s,"Nerd Fact: Paul Desmond, the saxophonist on this track, wrote the song."
s64l8s,The great Richard Cheese struggled to do a cover of Drakes Hotline Bling.  He eventually nailed it using take 5 as the backing music.  Song kicks ass. https://youtu.be/ZzGqwjcI42U
s64l8s,There are no skips on Time Out nor Time Further Out. Dynamite albums
s64l8s,"The Brubeck Brothers Quartet does an incredible version of this that they get a little more exploratory with. Really elevates an already near-perfect tune. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC9lJBzOmzg"
s64l8s,"The full album, Time Out, is one of the best jazz albums ever recorded."
s64l8s,STILL the best. Coolness on a Zen level.
s64l8s,The gateway drug to fine Jazz exploration for Jazz newbies.
s64l8s,How is this not in the hall of fame yet?
s64l8s,"Please also enjoy this reggae version of it

s64l8s,"This entire album is good, but Take Five is exceptional."
s64l8s,"If you're looking for some more odd meter jazz, Hank Levy has some other great compositions.

s64l8s,"I like how each player gets a chance to describe in music what they do for their ""take 5"" breaks, or at least, that's how I interpreted it.

s64l8s,Am I the only one that mistakenly thought this was a holiday song for the longest time?
s64l8s,One of the best songs of all time
s64l8s,One of my favorite songs ever. I've used it as a ring tone for years. When my son was little he was so used to hearing it as my phone ringing that he got confused when I played it the car. Only 4 instruments that blend in such a perfect way.
s64l8s,"For those who care: this song is in a very difficult and rare 5/4 time signature. Meaning that whereas most songs in popular music are 4/4 (you can count up to 4 for each measure), this song has 5 beats in a measure. If you try and count along with the drum you'll see and you'll also realize how unnatural it feels when you count. That's the brilliance of this song. They made an unnatural, uneven time signature into one of the most natural, relaxed songs of all time."

s64l8s,"Story time!  


A couple of years back, my Father, my Girlfriend (at the time), and myself were all watching Jeopardy on Netflix after dinner one night. This was our Saturday routine. We'd drive up to have dinner with my Father and then binge Jeopardy.  


One night, during Final Jeopardy, a clue about music comes up. I can't recall the exact clue but it had something to do with a well-known jazz song. Being a music enthusiast, I knew the answer, but in their underestimation of me, both my Father and Girlfriend thought I was talking out my ass and just guessing. My girlfriend goes:  


""If you get this right, I will shit myself.""  


Alex Trebek comes on and reveals the Final Jeopardy answer to be... TAKE FIVE BY THE FREAKING DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET!!! Exactly what I had said to my Father and Girlfriend. Girlfriend's jaw drops and my Father and I are rolling over in laughter.  


My girlfriend and I split since then and she stills owes me a shit in the pants..."
s64l8s,One of the iconic tracks that everyone heard of but rarely know the name of
s64l8s,"I remember seeing him play this live, something like 15-20ish years ago. So cool. Nothing like seeing some bad ass septuagenarians in tuxedos pump out jam after jam, but the fact that the drummer broke the drum solo in _Take Five_ into something like a 10 minute solo is still damn impressive to me."

s64l8s,My family would play some music during dinner every night when I was growing up and this might have been the most played song. Still a favorite of mine!
s64l8s,"Grew up with parents listening to this album a lot - love it.

Don't miss Carmen McRae's vocal version with the Quartet:

Was in The Sopranos episode where Tony and Bobby get in to that fistfight. So smooth."
s64l8s,I was showed this in a college class as a freshman. I wish I could find more 5/4 jazz.
s64l8s,"Oh yeah, this was one of my gateway drugs.  The full list:  


* Take the A Train
* So What
* Take Five"
s64l8s,Don't wanna overhype it but it's literally the greatest track of the 20th century
s64l8s,One of my favorite Jazz albums
s64l8s,"This is one of my all time favorite albums.  If you're new to jazz check out Money Jungle by Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach, another awesome album."
s64l8s,"Andrew Lloyd Webber, no stranger to ""borrowing"" from his musical inspirations, used the 5/4 groove and chord changes of ""Take Five"" in Jesus Christ Superstar. It shows up every time Jesus and his disciples butt heads about their mission statement. ""I must be mad thinking I'd be remembered, yes, I must be out of my head/Look at your blank faces, my name will mean nothing ten minutes after I'm dead!/One of you denies me, one of you betrays me,"" etc.

A few decades later, a modern Catholic hymn, ""Sing of the Lord's Goodness"" appeared, which paraphrases both Brubeck's composition AND the Andrew Lloyd Webber version. It's impossible to hear it and not accidentally fill in the Superstar lyrics instead."
s64l8s,"That's the Jazz tune of jazz tunes. My Mom turned me onto it when I was a kid before I got into jazz like David Sanborn, Spyro Gyra, Jaco, Chik Corea. Stanley Jordan."
s64l8s,"This is such a great album. It‚Äôs perfect for a lazy fall or winter Sunday. I hated Jazz most of my life (abusive step father was a super fan, and it got a taint for me because of that), and this album is my first real enjoyment of the genre."
s64l8s,"Oh, yeah."
s64l8s,That 5/4 time signature is so hot rn
s64l8s,"I'm a South Indian classical percussionist and I love this piece. The history is a little unique, as Joe Morello was inspired to do this after an impromptu drumming session with a leading South Indian percussionist in the 50's. This 5/4 time signature is very common in our music."
s64l8s,It's weird to see this post. I've been listening to this song on repeat for the past four days as I learn to play it on saxophone. Great song! Desmond is so underrated.
s64l8s,Will never not upvote this gateway music drug.
s64l8s,If someone wants to get into jazz I'd sound this song first.  If they don't like it I would shoot them.
s64l8s,"REPOST, that I don't mind upvoting every time I see it."
s64l8s,Can I be the one to post this next month?
s64l8s,"I‚Äôm 21 and this is one of my favorite songs ever. Nobody my age has ever heard it, let alone knows about Dave Brubeck"
s64l8s,Yeah but have you ever heard of Take 6?
s64l8s,There is a wonderful mashup Rodrigo y Gabriela does of Take 5 with Metallica‚Äôs One
s64l8s,These guys fuckin shred
s64l8s,There is a Lost Tapes album I found a while back that fantastic as well.
s64l8s,"The whole album is great. 

I bet it has the record for being the album in the most collections that have only one jazz album. Either that or Vince Guaraldi‚Äôs Charlie Brown Christmas album."
s64l8s,This always makes me think of warm spring afternoons or summer nights with a fine cocktail and attractive company.
s64l8s,so fucking good
s64l8s,Can't believe I only heard this song for the first time like 5 years ago all thanks to David Lynch.
s64l8s,This is one of my favorite jazz albums ever. Paul Desmond is the shit.
s64l8s,[Stranglers' Golden Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAsI3U2EaE) is an homage to Take Five.  It's another song that I would play 10 times over to feel the unique time signature and changes.
s64l8s,Thank you Thomas Crown Affair for getting me into Brubeck.
s64l8s,I grew up to this album.
s64l8s,my parents had this LP and i wore out the grooves playing it every day for months! i still love it!

s64l8s,This was one of the first albums I bought when I started my vinyl collection!
s64l8s,Best Jazz Song
s64l8s,Is this the most universally enjoyed jazz song among non-jazz listeners? Honest question. It was a topic of convo that came up irl recently
s64l8s,I‚Äôve been collecting Take Five covers on Spotify. I‚Äôm at 27 hours at this point. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1tZnVLmHl6KLMfFQxhcl4o?si=AttGkjsmSwCvija_jlCrNg
s64l8s,"I have listened to this so many times but its so beautiful and fresh every time. Also being a sax player myself, the solo is insane. Not complex but how the notes are played simultaneously articulated and not is so beautiful and nonchalant cool"
s64l8s,"My favorite rendition of Take Five is [Panzerballett's ""Fake Five""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM4W3qaNfng) where they play two time signatures at the same time."
s64l8s,The only guy to make 5/4 time signature feel proper and not like somebody just screwed up the beat.  Love it!
s64l8s,"This whole album is a treasure. If you love this song it‚Äôs worth checking out the rest, my favorites being Kathy‚Äôs Waltz and Strange Meadow Lark, every song experiments with time signatures differently and they‚Äôre all beautiful in a different way. 

And there‚Äôs also the sequel, Time Further Out."
s64l8s,He‚Äôs no Roy Donk.
s64l8s,The Paul Desmond version is my fave.
s64l8s,"Ima save this, abd listen. Sounds dope from the start"
s64l8s,King Tubby does an interesting reggae version.
s64l8s,"The drums, the recoding of and playing are just incredibly good. The drum break played on a decent stereo is just one of my favorite things ever."
s64l8s,Highly recommend the 50th anniversary edition of Time Out. Contains some great live cuts including Take Five.
s64l8s,What an amazing album. Listening to it all day because of this post.
s64l8s,This is my favorite jazz song.
s64l8s,I can't hear this without immediately picturing cocktail chemistry trying to make a fancy milk washed punch version of something
s64l8s,Blue Rondo ala Turk still blows my mind.
s64l8s,"I got this record from a thrift store and theres a locked groove somewhere right around 4:15-4:17ish. It plays on a near-perfect loop ad infinitum... kinda freaky. First time played it took me a good 5-10 min of it looping to realize lol. 

Also a huge bummer because thats exactly the moment that the previous section sort of resolves and its clear the anticipation of the previous buildup is about to bring in something interesting next."
s64l8s,Brubeck is that DUDE-bek
s64l8s,Love this album. Have it on vinyl.
s64l8s,"If you like this, listen to ‚ÄúTake Ten‚Äù by Paul Desmond."
s64l8s,"I used to play the saxophone. I regret never learning to play this song. Probably for the better, though, because I wasn't good enough to do it justice."
s64l8s,This is the definition of Jazz to me
s64l8s,That's great.
s64l8s,"For years I've used this song as a jazz intro to yutes. I ask then to follow along and notice which is the led instrument as the song progresses. Don't know if I ever created a jazz fan, but at least they were intrigued."
s64l8s,My dad had this album back in the day. He was in the Air Force and deployed somewhere overseas so I was looking through his stuff. As a little kid I played it simply because I liked the cover. Still listening to this day. That‚Äôs art.
s64l8s,I enjoyed Art Farmer and his Jazztet after
s64l8s,This is the greatest driving song of all time. Period.
s64l8s,This is always the most pleasant hold music
s64l8s,Dougie Jones
s64l8s,"every time I hear this song the room dim into a noir style film, there's rain by the window, a cigarette is lying on an ash tray appears by my side, coffee that has gone cold sit by a desk, the intoxicating smell of sweet tobacco, brandy and the slight mustiness of rain and the city mingle together."
s64l8s,Chris Dorner‚Äôs  favourite song
s64l8s,"Dave Brubeck was in ƒ∞stanbul for an United Nations Concert Tour and he heard the street musician and their ""different"" rhythms (aksak rhythms: 5/4, 7/8, 9/8) and decided to write songs in these rhythms. In the same album, there is Blue Rondo a la Turc which swing between 9/8 and 4/4 (they go back to 4/4 for the solo section) and take five is in as all of the thread said in 5/4."
s64l8s,"i have that record, i would say blue rondo is better cuz it's in 9/8"
s64l8s,The iconic version of this song ...
s64l8s,I love this album and have been listening to it since I discovered it in 1974.
s64l8s,California Concert
s64l8s,I guess... now I like jazz?
s64l8s,Their music gets played too often. Its a bit annoying.
s64l8s,This right here is good stuff. Love it.

s69xof,"You left off my favorite Three Dog Night (cover) song: Never Been To Spain

Also, more than half of those songs are covers, so people may associate the songs with other versions, or even more than one version.

I think people might identify Try a Little Tenderness as an Otis Redding song. 

Black and White is a Pete Seeger cover.

Shambala was released by two artists almost at the same time (TDN was second), and both were quite popular."
s69xof,"As a person named Jeremiah; the less people who know them, the better."
s69xof,"One of my funniest memories is getting into an old-fashioned barroom argument with a girl who insisted that ‚ÄúJoy to the World‚Äù was by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Kept telling her it was Three Dog Night. Wouldn‚Äôt listen. Ended up *calling her dad* to back her up. It was fun watching her face fall when he told her the truth.

Anyway, she ended up being crazy and stalking my friend."
s69xof,Grew up with my parents playing the 8-track of TDN. Shambala is still one of my favorite songs.
s69xof,Where the hell is Eli‚Äôs Coming?
s69xof,"Back in prep school 25 years ago, my roommate made fun of me for buying ""Three Dog Nights Greatest Hits"" on cassette. He was the son of Paul Williams who wrote ""Just an old Fashion Love Song."" It was on the cassette!"
s69xof,">Old Fashioned Love Song

OK you got me. This song just *slaps*."
s69xof,"Had a similar conversation with a guy at work.

Him: Yeah, I like that type of music (70's era).

Me: Did you ever get into the Doobie Brothers?

Him: Well, no. They didn't really have a lot of hits, did they?

I proceeded to enlighten him."
s69xof,The Guess Who has to be in the conversation as well
s69xof,Easy to be hard?
s69xof,"I always enjoyed Three Dog Night. They were also my first concert, granted I'm only in my early 30s so they weren't in their prime, but I still had a great time!"
s69xof,The Hollies are similar in the US
s69xof,Pieces of April. Love that song.
s69xof,My uncle played drums for them on tour at some point in the later 70s. Not an original member but I always thought that was pretty cool.
s69xof,What? They were crazy popular at their peak. That happens to many artists. Some people do not know who The Rolling Stones are. Blows my mind.
s69xof,Tommy James and the Shondells? Doesn't help that at least two of their hits have cover versions that charted higher than their own.
s69xof,"You forgot ""Play Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)"", I got to meet Jimmy Greenspoon and the rest of the band and they were/are a great bunch of people."
s69xof,Dude i never fucking tire of Shambala that song can get it
s69xof,"I don't know about that buddy, out of all the 70's bands Three Dog Night are modestly popular, moreso than a lot of one hit wonders from that time, especially back in the 90's when Filter covered their song ""One"" for the X-Files soundtrack, they kept using that song in trailers and ads for awhile

One of my favorite Three Dog Night stories is how they took a young Elton John on tour with them and he had written ""Your Song"" and tried to give it to them, but they were like nah breh we'll play it and record a version of it but you need to record it for your own album because it's that good lmao and now it's one of Elton John's most iconic songs

Edit: very cool to find out ""One"" was written by Harry Nilsson and it was just popularized by Three Dog Night, kind of like how Ring of Fire was written by June Carter Cash for her sister but popularized by Johnny Cash recording a version of it"
s69xof,"I inherited a bunch of my dad‚Äôs albums, and one that I haven‚Äôt played yet is a Three Dog Night greatest hits album, called Joy to the World. 

I‚Äôve never been too into that song, so I‚Äôve passed over it, but to OP‚Äôs point I should probably give it a spin, there‚Äôs probably stuff I didn‚Äôt know I liked, lol.

Edit: OK I gave it a listen, and OP is right, lots of good stuff on there, and the one I had totally forgotten about, and didn‚Äôt know was TDN I *I‚Äôve never been to Spain* good stuff."
s69xof,"Are The Misfits the #1 Band on a t-shirt that people haven't probably heard a song by?

I was into punk and metal pretty heavily and never stumbled upon anything by them, and If I did I wasn't aware."
s69xof,"There's a Canadian band called Chilliwack and I saw them a few years ago at some festival. I thought I only knew one song, that ""My Girl (gone gone got she's been gone so long) song. It turned out that I knew about 8 songs by them!  ""California Girl"" ""Fly at Night"" etc.."
s69xof,Shambala underrated
s69xof,To be fair I feel like the iconic ‚Äúdance to the music‚Äù is really only via Sly & The Family Stone.   I know of three dog night and never even had heard that Celebrate track
s69xof,"The fact that they have a song called 'Mama Told Me Not to Come"" cracks me up, considering lead singer Chuck Negron's dick once split from fucking too much."
s69xof,"Agreed. In the top 5 has to be The Guess Who. Just mention them casually, and there‚Äôs a 90% chance someone says, ‚ÄúYou mean The Who?‚Äù üôÑ"
s69xof,Steve Miller Band may be another. We saw him about 20 years ago and I kept thinking.... Damn this is his song too?!
s69xof,"I'll say The Lovin' Spoonful is right there

s69xof,"I have Three Dog Night‚Äôs It Ain‚Äôt Easy, and I have trouble getting into it but Mama Told Me Not to Come is really enjoyable."
s69xof,"I must be old or misreading this, because this is not an obscure band at all."
s69xof,"Also ""Out in the Country""."
s69xof,I‚Äôm there are lots of teens who don‚Äôt know all the top bands from 50 years ago.  The Carpenters come immediately to mind.
s69xof,"Hell, I've seen them live"
s69xof,Loved them when i was a kid.
s69xof,Pieces of April.
s69xof,"Was in high school during the their heyday. Loved Three Dog Night. They weren't as ""heavy"" as many of the artists I enjoyed but such great hits. A very hard working and under rated band to be sure."
s69xof,"These songs are great but every time I go on a Three dog Night listening bender the hits just seem so lacking and forgettable after the second chorus usually. Of course seeing this post made me start another bender right now though..


I'm not trying to trash them. I want to love them, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is about them that makes hearing them on repeat kinda suck"
s69xof,"[One Man Band](https://youtu.be/IKbz6gCmlWw)
[Eli's coming](https://youtu.be/1A2eet1bttY)
[Liar](https://youtu.be/otv4kmbRp9E)

[Never Been to Spain](https://youtu.be/dm6qw_yeo6o)

Every song you listed by them I do not like often because they're the worst and over played. Like that one song that got popular and everyone likes it but you don't know why... Joy to the world... Hate that song. They have such better songs. Some of my favorite albums."
s69xof,"They weren't always an unknown name.  In the '80's (I think) there was even a greatest hits album with an ""As Seen On TV"" ad especially for it.  They've certainly dropped out of the common consciousness since then, though, but so have a lot of other bands that also had TV-ad albums - Little River Band comes to mind, and Creedence Clearwater Revival (the best of these three, imo) may be headed in the same direction.  Three Dog Night relied more heavily on cover songs than a lot of really popular bands, but they were top-notch interpreters; they really put their hearts into performing and I always dug them, if mostly on a 'hits' basis."
s69xof,Deep down I think the reason why is they don't get the same respect as other bands because they never wrote a single one of these songs. You just don't get the same respect as a cover band as you do an originals band.
s69xof,"Thought I was reading a fallout sub post, ngl lol"
s69xof,"Herman's Hermits can compete in this category

s69xof,Also Little Feat
s69xof,"They mostly did not write their own music, same as the Fifth Dimension, but fantastically covered music written by people like Laura Nyro, also like the Fifth Dimension, and made huge hits of them, again like the Fifth Dimension. This was during the same time frame. 

They were a tight band with an excellent ear for new material as well as excellent arranging and performing skills. But I think you are right, and even in their own time were not considered album artists so much as hit makers."
s69xof,"C‚Äômon, everyone knows them. Personally, I like Kryptonite and Semi-charmed Life."
s69xof,Shambala is on my top 250 songs list.
s69xof,"The Guess Who too, like 20 hit singles"
s69xof,"... and amazingly you are missing a bunch. 

I was 11 when I graduated sixth grade, and ""Joy to the World"" was kind of our theme song that spring.

JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROG!!!

That song made absolutely no sense, which was it's appeal."
s69xof,I always thought TDN was corny AF and can't stand them.  Dragging The Guess Who into this is just a travesty.
s69xof,The Rascals same thing.
s69xof,I love the story of how they came up with their name. In Australia the aboriginal people would sleep with their dogs for warmth. If it was very cold out they called it a three dog night.
s69xof,Then there's Grand Funk Railroad.
s69xof,"My favorite is ""I've Never Been to Spain"", but I do love the other songs by them that were listed."
s69xof,No ***Ely's Coming*** on that list?
s69xof,Easy to be hard.  Fucking gem.
s69xof,"I love Three Dog Night, but they covered  their hits.

Joy to the World (Jeremiah was a bullfrog), Hoyt Axton

Mama Told Me (Not to Come), Randy Newman

Celebrate (...dance to the music), 	Gary Bonner, Alan Gordon

One (...is the lonliest number), Harry Nilsson

Black and White, David I. Arkin and Earl Robinson. Recorded by Pete Seeger.

Try a Little Tenderness, Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly, and Harry M. Woods. Also covered well by Otis Redding

Shambala, Daniel Moore, Released simultaneously by B. W. Stevenson

Old Fashioned Love Song,  Paul Williams

&#x200B;

You left off one of my favorites, ""Never Been to Spain"", also from Hoyt Axton"
s69xof,"Hoyt Axton, the dad in Gremlins, wrote Joy to the World for them."
s69xof,I thought this was about fallout
s69xof,The lead singer wrote a memoir and called it 'Three Dog Nightmare'.
s69xof,"Eli's coming which Laura Nyro wrote was a pretty big hit as well as The show must go on and I think a few others

They were all over the radio there for quite a while"
s69xof,"They are all covers though, right??"
s69xof,"Bread is a close second. They popped up on my recommendation a few months ago and I listened to them just because the name sounded funny, but recognized the first 10 songs in like the first 5 notes each."
s69xof,I'm gonna put my two cents and say Canned Heat has the worst ratios..
s69xof,My first concert. TDN was a fantastic group/show
s69xof,"Remember their version of I must let the show go on??
My Chris Farley voice"
s69xof,"Don't forget ""The Show Must Go On"".  I saw them the year that song came out."
s69xof,Little River Band and The Spinners would also qualify for that consideration.  Tons of recognizable hits for both.
s69xof,‚òùüèºLove every one of those! ‚òùüèº
s69xof,Eli‚Äôs Coming is their best work.  The Show Must Go On is great too‚Ä¶.
s69xof,Um‚Ä¶ u forgot:  Spinning Wheel; You Made Me So Very Happy;  Lucretia Mcevil‚Ä¶
s69xof,"I missed the word ""Night"" in the title and was trying to recognize any of the listed songs from Fallout 3."
s69xof,I used to listen to the greatest hits CD my step dad had. Grew up listening to nearly all the songs already on the local classic rock radio station. Loved all of them.
s69xof,My aunt divorced the keyboardist of Three dog Night and married my uncle. Almost too crazy a story to be true. Ask me anything. I probably don't know much.
s69xof,"Easy to be Hard


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SrD14jqTtAE"
s69xof,"I knew exactly who you meant the second I read this! I had this record when I was little. It was a smaller record, and had belonged to my mom and somehow I just forever borrowed it lol. Damn, thanks for taking me down memory lane!"
s69xof,Easy To Be Hard is such a great song. I loved its use in the intro of the film Zodiac.
s69xof,10CC would like a word‚Ä¶
s69xof,I always though that Jeremiah sounded like a pretty chill amphibious dude. I really would have liked to hear much more about him and maybe a bit less about the fishes in the deep blue sea.
s69xof,Three dog night should be in the rock n roll hall of fame. Period.
s69xof,Three dog night is one of my favorite criminally underrated bands
s69xof,And they didn't write a single one of them. Or any of their material for that matter.
s69xof,"Guess it was best to be there at the time. And, I still like Three Dog Night."
s69xof,"""The Show Must Go On"" is also a banger."
s69xof,"I heard ""Liar"" on the radio a week or two ago."
s69xof,"Otis wrote the song, but gave it to Franklin and she made it a hit."
s69xof,"My mom played their greatest hits CD a lot when I was a preteen.  It's such a nice album nowadays, but I didn't appreciate it then bc of the repetition."
s69xof,""" Out in the Country"" was a good one too. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49bl6FrgZTs"
s69xof,"If you like Three Dog Night and Chuck Negron, go read ""Three Dog Nightmare"", it's his memoirs and it's incredible. He had so much sex his dick literally exploded, one of the wildest tales of rock and roll debauchery. They even mention Brian Wilson's Drug Teepee!"
s69xof,"It's starting to change, but ELO was like that for a while."
s69xof,I always think of Tommy James and the Shondells for someone who has a ton of hits with little name recognition.
s69xof,Damn man these guys sounds hella fun thanks for sharing
s69xof,Wow I didn't realize all these songs were them! I hate this band!
s69xof,One is not a three dog night song.
s69xof,Never heard any of these songs before in my life and I listen to older music frequently.
s69xof,Love them!
s69xof,"I also didn‚Äôt recognize the band name and I thought you were referring to 6 dogs, so I was really thrown off for a second. Also apparently he‚Äôs dead now which sucks."
s69xof,I have heard the name but I don‚Äôt know any of the songs
s69xof,...I could have sworn half of those were Creedence songs. I hang my head in shame.
s69xof,Nice find ! I do hear some of those played a lot in my workplace when it's 70's muzak week.
s69xof,"They put on a great concert! Good sense of humor on stage by starting with a Rolling Stones song and then saying, ""Oops. That's not one of ours. I meant to play..."""
s69xof,"I love 3 Dog Night. I think Blood, Sweat and Tears had a similar branding issue. But Tommy James and the Shondels has it worst of all."
s69xof,"Three Dog Night were not songwriters, but they had great taste in songs and performed them well."
s69xof,The artist RES did a good cover of one.
s69xof,"Got to see them perform live on 4th of July one year at a concert in the park they did, was great."
s69xof,Iron Maiden
s69xof,The original boy band.
s69xof,"Scoured  the comments, and unless I missed it, I didn't see [I Can Hear You Calling](https://youtu.be/bhhSpi7mIN0) listed anywhere.

This is the track that nearly sent me to the chiropractor the first time I heard it."
s69xof,"Oh yeah, that‚Äôs the band where the lead singer had the ‚Äúexploding penis‚Äù incident. Crazy story. I believe he wrote a memoir. 

I heard an interview he did on the Dopey podcast and I‚Äôll admit, I had no clue who the band was or what hits they were responsible for‚Ä¶"
s69xof,They were very popular and well known in the early 70s.
s69xof,I'm more familiar with Three Dog Night because one of them had so much sex his dick exploded.
s69xof,"I had no idea they sang One.  We played a lot of dice games growing up and anytime my dad rolled a one he would start singing that song. I didn't even realize that it was a real song until I was probably a teenager and they played it on the oldies station. 

I of course named my son Jeremiah and every person over the age of 50 sings to him about being a bullfrog including the OB as she was cleaning him up."
s69xof,"I may be in the minority here but I genuinely only recognize the song One....

I have to disagree with the notion that most people would recognize their songs unless their big music heads or know somebody who loved them."
s69xof,Cover band
s69xof,"They are definitely up there.  


Grand Funk and Bachman Turner overdrive have to be in the running as well."
s69xof,"I‚Äôm going to suggest that Ambrosia also belongs on this list. They put out some great hits, but how many people actually know who they are?"
s69xof,i haven‚Äôt heard of three dog night in yearsssss. my grandma loves them
s69xof,Why oh why didn't Book Of Eli use the song Eli's Coming in the promos? I love that song.
s69xof,Yes
s69xof,"There‚Äôs a town in Utah, Bullfrog, I want to petition it, to change its name to Jeremiah‚Ä¶"
s69xof,Yes! Every time I hear ‚ÄúThree Dog Night‚Äù I think is that the band that sings that kryptonite Superman song from the 90‚Äôs  early 2000‚Äôs. I sure hated that song. I like the bullfrog song though.
s69xof,I am named after two band members of Three Dog Night - Corey and Michael (first and middle names.) My dad would not be proud that I can not also tell you their last names
s69xof,LimeWire had something to do with this with Artists not matching songs. People errors !!
s69xof,I feel the same about OneRepublic.
s69xof,You all never stepped foot in a proper Record (Music) store and it shows.
s69xof,High number of hits and low name recognition. So a really high ratio
s69xof,Grew up listening to my dad's TDN albums. Every song is great. Just a really talented band that knew how to write really good songs.
s69xof,"Great, great band"
s69xof,I love every one of those songs!
s69xof,"Grassroots would be similar, although not as many hits as TDN."
s69xof,"Literally yesterday I asked my girlfriend if she knew who Three Dog Night was, she said no but continued to recognize the next half dozen songs I played by them. They fucking slap for sure"
s69xof,Eli‚Äôs Comin‚Äô.
s69xof,"The Show Must Go On is one of my favorite songs ever. 

Was at work with my headphones on, playlist on shuffle and it just hit me. Think I paused for a minute just to listen. 

I've got a few songs that hit me like that, but it's probably one of favorite cover songs ever. They did it right."
s69xof,"I disagree. I think Foreigner does. I swear, like 40 hits that I don‚Äôt realize is them"
s69xof,I am going to make them my first listen tomorrow.
s69xof,"I can't hear 3 dog night without thinking of this story from Chuck Negron's autobiography (which my parents bought me when I was in Jr high)

‚ÄúI think it was Miss Oklahoma and we ended up spending the night together and in the middle of the sex, it was like a hot dog splitting and you know, I found myself in the emergency room with my penis in my hand waiting to be stitched up.‚Äù"
s69xof,Michael Allsup lived in my parents house in Modesto before they bought it in 89-90.
s69xof,"[must let the show go on](https://youtu.be/_lr-jzy-CNM) may not be well known these days, but I enjoyed any songs to do with circus life back when."
s69xof,This isn't fallout 3 wtf
s69xof,"[trust me, dude](https://youtu.be/O3fl2ENXITQ)"
s69xof,"Fun Fact: they're the only band to have three #1s on the Billboard Hot 100, each sung by a different member."
s69xof,So right!
s69xof,"Saw them perform on July 4, 2002 in Frisco, TX for local holiday celebration. They were great! So good I remember 20 years later."
s69xof,"Dang, I came thinking this post was about Fallout 3..."
s69xof,They were the first concert I went to as a teenager with a new drivers license. It was a great show. I bet I have some 35mm slides of it. Took place in Muncie IN
s69xof,"In late 1970 early 1971, Danny Hutton invited Elton John to his Laurel Canyon home and spiked EJs food with cocaine"
s69xof,"I‚Äôve heard that term as an Australian explained as an old indigenous term for a night cold enough to warrant the warmth of three dogs sleeping at your side. I always like it. And I know every single song listed (maybe some from covers eg Animals for mama told me) but yeah I wouldn‚Äôt in a million years even think that terms existed outside Australia.

Edit: spelling"
s69xof,"""Eli's Coming"" is another good song.

I always recognize a Three Dog Night song when I hear it--Chuck Negron had an amazing voice (too bad he got hooked on drugs).

But then again, I grew up in the 1970s. Three Dog Night had so many hits in the early 1970s. If you were listening to music during that decade, you know all their songs."
s69xof,Liar was the one for me. Different shade to their usual stuff.
s69xof,Buck Rogers favourite band!
s69xof,I grew up in the 70‚Äôs. I loved Three Dog Night! Thank you for reminding me just how great they are/were. I just blasted The Best Of 3 Dog Night. FANTASTIC album! I‚Äôm in heaven! Thanks again for helping me escape the bulls*#t happening in the world today üòÉ
s69xof,2.Fantastic track
s69xof,thhhhhreeee dogggg AWOOOO and you're listening to galaxy news radio
s69xof,I assume I would recognize a couple of those songs if I hear them? But I don't recognize any by name.

s7lzuf,"Hi,

Lots of synthetic sound there, not much ""real"" instruments, but anyway what I heard:

Runnin':

\- Synth bass & pads

\- Programmed drums (no real drummer I think)

\- Synth orchestral mix (mostly strings)

\- Some appearance of an electric guitar here and there, maybe genuine?

Overall not many musicians required for that track, it's mostly programmed stuff out of a computer.

&#x200B;

My Heart: in order of appearance more or less

Note: the mix is over-produced with lots of effects, so it's really difficult to tell whether there are real instruments or synths.

\- Various synth keyboards with distinctively electronic sounds

\- Ethnic flute solo (real or synth? can't say for sure)

\- String section (again real or not)

\- Electric piano comping throughout, starting at 0'20 (might be a real electro-accoustic one)

\- Electric bass (yeah probably a human player here)

\- Drums (again real player, but heavily ladden with effects)

\- At 3.08 a Oboe line (or English Horn)

\- Some really shy electric guitar lost in the strings, I think

\- At 4.23 French Horn"

My Heart Will Go On is a standard pop ensemble of drums guitar bass keys plus tin whistle and strings."

s7krsi,"I honestly only listen to the music these days, I really don‚Äôt have time to look up the artists lifestyles or follow them, I don‚Äôt care basically unless something makes the headlines and it‚Äôs really bad."
s7krsi,"You don‚Äôt need a loophole, just be more secure in your beliefs. Art is bigger than the people who create it. Songs take on lives of their own the second they are released. 

I find it funny that people come down on this with art and art alone. You know how many terrible people started businesses that are still around today? Ford was a real POS, yet people still drive the vehicles bearing his name around without a second thought, etc., etc.

Shitty people are capable of doing great things, great people are capable of doing shitty things. There isn‚Äôt any reason to second guess what you enjoy."

s7krsi,"Do you thoroughly vet every single musician you listen to and every person who is making money off of each of those releases?

If no, congrats! You're already successfully separating the art from the artist(s)!

Although if you are listening to music with **explicitly** hateful themes you might have a problem worth looking into."
s7krsi,For artists that I think are horrible people I only buy used copies of their CDs/records so they get no money from me. I also almost never stream their music. I don't want them to even get that .00000012 from me. But I can separate someone who's a great artist from the fact that they are garbage human beings.
s7krsi,"People only talk about ""separating the art from the artist"" to excuse supporting shitty people, but in reality separating the art from the artist just means taking in the music without any consideration to the artist's personal life. Which, if you ask me, is a pretty boring way to listen to music sometimes.

I'm of the opinion that you can listen to what you want, but if the artist is a piece of shit, there's no need to announce that you're going to keep listening to them. Whenever there's a discussion here about someone's allegations people are tripping over each other to post ""sEpArAtE aRt FrOm ArTiStS."" which just makes it really clear to me that they don't care about the artist's behaviour."
s7krsi,"You can‚Äôt help what music you like.  If they‚Äôve created something that makes you happy by listening to it or has any sort of cathartic emotional impact on you, go easy on yourself and embrace it without feeling guilty.  It‚Äôs just vibrations in the air. If you think the any of the artists you listen to are terrible people, I just wouldn‚Äôt support them financially, and would try not to promote them in any way."
s7krsi,Most people have done something bad at some point in their lives. It‚Äôs why we forgive and learn and grow. While people don‚Äôt come back from their more extreme atrocities it doesn‚Äôt make them less human. No human is solely good or pure so the art we know today would not exist without some evil. If we cancelled everyone bad we‚Äôd have no music left.

s7rtyv,"This quote is disturbing‚Äî‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so incredibly important to have representation as POC women in this scene, because when we constantly see only all straight white cis male bands on lineups and magazine covers, it inherently teaches us that we don‚Äôt belong,‚Äù T√©a Campbell, Meet Me @ The Altar‚Äôs guitarist, told The Independent last year‚Äù

s7wilh,"??? 

It was a safety issue, not some mass sacrifice if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to get at. I think it‚Äôs a bad mix of subjects personally."
s7wilh,"This is a joke, right?

Edit: only ask because I just read through the survey. Wt actual f?"
s7wilh,Jesus Christ how anyone could believe astroworld is connected to satanism is beyond me. You need to research what modern satanism is if you believe so
s7wilh,Id be interested in reading your essay
s7wilh,Jesus christ... I listen to plenty of metal and that survey was painful to read through
s7wilh,"i'm sorry, how did you arrive at this? i've heard nothing reguarding any relation between travis scott, astroworld, and satan. there's plenty of actual satanic music, especially in metal, but i can tell you right now none of those bands are sacrificing their fans to satan. i'm pretty sure modern day satanism has nothing to do involving ritual sacrifice. that's just like some shit that was cooked up by the media.

is this just a theory of yours or has this been perpetuated elsewhere online? i mean i can tell you right now that what happened has nothing to do with satan and everything to do with an idiot with a microphone who disregarded the safety of his fans and the people working the event. let's not go looking to blame anyone else or looking for some half baked theory about sacrifice. travis scott is a fucking idiot who incited a mob of dumb ass kids. there's nothing more to it."
s7wilh,Yikes
s7wilh,Most satanism in music isn't actual satanism. It's rejection of the dominance of christianity and the bible in society. It's provoking conservative christians to make all christians look out of touch with society.
s7wilh,You must be joking? I guess you just don‚Äôt understand what satanism is?
s7wilh,Nice biased poll. There isn‚Äôt any satanism in music. It‚Äôs so ridiculous to think otherwise. Just because someone is a terrible human being (Travis Scott) doesn‚Äôt mean they worship Satan through their music. ü§™
s7wilh,"Just so people know, i dont at all think that there was a satanic sacrifice happening but i have seen a lot of people on multiple occasions talking about it with those kinds of remarks. If you think the first question is kinda useless which i understand if you believe that this was just a badly organized event, just tell me what you think about the general selling your soul to achieve fame or for example robert johnson that is said to have sold his sould for the ability to play guitar."
s7wilh,Thanks a lot to the people that took their time to respond to the form i appreciate it :)
s7wilh,"I have been in heavy bands playing drums for over 20 years. I've been running a music studio for the past 5 years recording heavy music as well. The one thing I could promise is that if you were to gather all the hundreds of metal bands I have shared the stage with and asked them this question, you'd get laughed out of the fucking room. 

First off, I know maybe 10 people tops who even believe in Satan and I say that because those people were overly Christian and talked about Jesus so I assume they bought the Satan package as well. The vast majority of metal musicians don't care or talk about Faith.

Besides... If you want to ""spread the word of Satan"",  music is a terrible way to go about it. Especially heavy music. Nobody buys albums anymore and heavy music can't hold a candle to other genre's in regards to popularity. ""I want to dedicate my life to spreading the word of Satan and I plan to do so by playing music in bars across the US barely making enough money to cover gas"" said nobody fucking ever.

You get into playing music because of the allure of attention from potential sexual partners, not to jerk off a ficticous character in which only the most naive and undereducated in society believe."

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

s7l9x0,"Depends what we‚Äôre measuring by, I think if its success, influence and their contribution to popular music I‚Äôd probably go Lennon/McCartney hands down. Prince is a strong choice so is mj though I genuinely don‚Äôt know how much of musician he was as far as I know he dosent play an instrument his more lyrics/vocals guy. For me personally I‚Äôd put Kanye or the neptunes in there as well somewhere for there large influence on pop/hip hop music through out the 00s but I know some would disagree with that. Kurt cobain Also influenced a whole decade of music just about and introduced a more mainstream audience to the underground punk/indie that influenced him."

As they roll into the first chorus, he starts dancing more energetically.
Look at the intensity in his eyes as they start the last verse ""well I could call out...""
For the final chorus his movement gets more frantic until he literally grabs hold of the mic with two hands and calms it down. The performance ends with him looking (and sounding) deflated and perhaps ashamed.

s72ypx,They‚Äôre viewed by some as imposters. They were part of the second wave of grunge acts when record labels were trying to cash in on a scene that evolved without them for the most part. This would be around the time JC Penney had a grunge section in their clothing department.
s72ypx,People hate because of Gavin being a prettyboy.
s72ypx,"I don‚Äôt think they are a ripoff of Nirvana or Soundgarden. Not going to say I‚Äôve listened to every single Bush song, but from what I have heard it‚Äôs all very generic sounding and reminds me of post-grunge rock that was popular through the late 90s and mid 2000s. They remind me of bands like Fuel, Saliva, Trapt etc etc which to me is very generic and not my favorite to listen to. I do like a few Bush songs though, definitely not a hater, just my two cents on the matter"
s72ypx,"Maybe it's not their fault, but they sound to me like the corporate version of grunge, like some A&R guys built a ""grunge"" band in their garage (making the sound as commercial as possible).

I just think their songwriting isn't very good. I'm sure they have some decent songs, but the singles I know are watered-down and generic-sounding."
s72ypx,"They were late to the party. The scene was already saturated. They were from the wrong part of the world. They took all the original grunge bands and put them in a blender, so they didn't really stand out in any way. They didn't really add anything new. But they were not bad. There's more bands like that, like Live and Silverchair."
s72ypx,Maybe because they weren't very good?
s72ypx,I love Bush
s72ypx,"Letting the Cables Sleep is one of the best songs to come out of that genre, to be fair."
s72ypx,"Well it‚Äôs a genre that‚Äôs central to the Pacific Northwest and they are from England. Also they‚Äôre coattail riders. Not a horrible band, some good songs, but very derivative and basically just filling a void."
s72ypx,Men hate Gavin for being good looking. Women hate him for cheating on Gwen.
s72ypx,16 stone was pretty great album for 15 year old me
s72ypx,"I mean, they're pretty generic and harmless. If Grunge-The Broadway Musical existed, they would be the soundtrack. Also, they came on the scene about 10 years too late. 
Maybe I'm just old and cranky. My ""grunge"" reference point is Tad."
s72ypx,"I personally don't pay attention to press and trends, so my dislike is based solely on the music.  Nothing bad about it, but nothing original, and the monotonous half an octave vocals just burn me out after about 7 minutes"
s72ypx,For me personally? I just don‚Äôt care for the singers voice. It sounds like he is forcing it way too much
s72ypx,"There were a bunch of post grunge acts that got caught up in the backlash. Candlebox, Seven Mary Three, Bush, Collective Soul, Silverchair, etc. 

Grunge itself was less about the sound and more about the rejection of studio approved acts being shoved down the throats of the consumer. 

Stone Temple Pilots were one of the first bands to get that backlash. But they were able to overcome it by evolving their sound and becoming something unique and great. Bush (and many other bands) never were able to do that, so they are looked down on today."
s7fqa2,"Not sure, but are you meaning Prince? He went by a weird symbol for a while."
s7fqa2,"Prince, while he was known as ‚Äúthe artist formerly known as‚Äù?"
s7fqa2,That‚Äôs probably Prince.  He did this because Warner Bros claimed the name ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù in a contractual dispute.

s79ecz,"Honestly I neither know nor care. I don't get why music has to be boxed and labelled. There are only two ""genres"" I know: music I like, and music I don't.

  I mena, sure, sometimes there are practical reasons for labelling a piece of music as ""classical"" or ""rock"" or ""jazz"", but there seem now to be almost as many sub-genres as there are pieces of music... enough, I say!"
s79ecz,"I guess this is similar to asking what determines a music genre. Korean language or not, it's just music and doesn't have to fall under any label. But I think adding ""K-"" to any genre is just a way of differentiating music that wasn't made by a western artist. I'm not a huge fan of using this sort of etymology because it kinda perpetuates xenophobia for non-western musicians, and I believe music transcends all culture and languages. BTS's music, for instance, sounds more ""pop"" and closer to 90s American pop groups than, say, Billie Eilish's music (depending on your definition of American Pop), so I'll never understand why there's so much resistance to categorizing Korean music genres into the same American genres. 

I wouldn't call DeVita a textbook example of what R&B music either, so my guess is that people just gravitate towards calling her a krnb artist because they latch onto whatever genre feels most convenient for an Asian artist. She's giving more alt/dream pop in my book.

Edit: Plus, by ""othering"" Asian artists using this classification, music enthusiasts will have a hard time finding similar artists within the same genre and instead be met with a ton of music recommendations of Kpop artists like Blackpink and BTS, which are nowhere close to the same genre."
s79ecz,K-pop comment sections on YT are fucking horrendous

s797j6,"it sounds like an electronic beat that has been reversed, panning"
s797j6,"If you're talking about the little reverse sound just before the clap, this is commonly used in electronic genres as a way to make the drums sound more interesting.

You usually take the sample of the clap, reverse it and place it right before the normal clap. Effects to make it stand out more are also added, such as drastic eq changes or heavy reverb."

s6igwr,"It‚Äôs possible. In my twenties I was a die hard death metal head, and I swore up and down that any other music wasn‚Äôt music and anyone that told me differently deserved a head butt. I went through a period of no music and when I came back I grew up, I learned music was music and now I enjoy all types of music. I still have dislikes but it‚Äôs not necessarily based on genre‚Äôs."
s6igwr,You're just jealous that my music taste is better than yours
s6igwr,It seems people use music to reinforce their ideologies. So instead of any given genre being an expression of the artist it instead becomes the backing track to their philosophies.
s6igwr,Music like all art is subjective. Garbage to one may be gold to another. I like noise music and I create it myself. Nobody is know like or appreciates it. I dont fucking care. I make it anyway. I also like pop music and grindcore. Whatever blows your skirt up man
s6igwr,"I love my music. Don't care who else does. I want all y'all to love your music, and not care if I do."

s6igwr,"My entire goal is to consume as much music as possible.

s6igwr,"No. Some people identify so closely with their personal preferences that they literally can't separate self from opinion.

Nod and wave. They're not going to change. Be sympathetic. That sort of attachment tends to make the world feel like a continuously hostile place to them. It makes their lives small and miserable."
s6igwr,"My music is the best, so yours can not be"
s6igwr,People have a hard time looking past their own opinions.
s6igwr,"I'm a bluegrass fan and I keep seeing kids show up in r/bluegrass who are getting bullied for liking the genre. It seemed less confrontational when I was a lad (im 35ish).   As with politics and healthcare nowadays I feel like everything is  getting adversarial.  The world is so crowded and the mind is so bombarded with information I wonder if a tribal mentality is just in our DNA, and this is simply survival instincts setting in.   Dig what you dig, it's all jazz in the end."
s6igwr,"Band I like good

s6igwr,"Honestly I just ignore people like that, they just don't understand the concept of subjectiveness."
s6igwr,"I mean - you're getting just as annoyed as other people sharing their opinions.

I don't disagree with you. if everyone liked the same stuff life would be pretty boring."
s6igwr,I couldn‚Äôt like this post more. Amen.
s6igwr,Yeah! *my* music is the best not yours
s6igwr,"""Don't yuck someone else's yum"" also applies to music preferences! It's just basic respect for other people."
s6igwr,"I mean.. I hear what you‚Äôre saying. And it‚Äôs true: we like what we like. But having a good palate in terms of music, means knowing about a lot of stuff. Knowing about all kinds of music. Recognizing how all the different genres of music relate to each other. Liking ‚Äúshitty‚Äù music is sort of like being ignorant, if that‚Äôs all you like. 

For example. 

If all I liked was spaghetti, or maybe mashed potatoes. It‚Äôs just so simple. Harmless? Yes. Who cares if all I like is Spaghetti? Or Chef Boyardee ravioli? It doesn‚Äôt matter. But don‚Äôt come trudging into a fine class restaurant saying The B52s are the greatest band of all time. Even though ‚ÄúLove Shack‚Äù holds its place in musical history, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
s6igwr,I say ‚Äúnot made for me‚Äù instead of any hateful terms. Sure I like music that is ‚Äúmade for me‚Äù better than music that is ‚Äúnot made for me.‚Äù But to hate anything I think is such a negative way to live your life. Different styles of music are either your thing or they aren‚Äôt. No need to shit on anything that isn‚Äôt your thing because it‚Äôs not your thing. Ya know?
s6igwr,It's not a superiority complex. It's actually the opposite. They incessantly seek validation because they're broken.
s6igwr,"How do you propose to stop people from thinking that their preference is the best? You don't. In personal preference I would say you are the ""man in the arena"" and those who are ""entitled"" with ""their type of music"" are the ""critics."" That said, consider the following speech by Roosevelt of all things: ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."""
s6igwr,"From 2009-2012 I ran a small used record store.

s6igwr,"Some people's taste really is underdeveloped though. I agree it's largely subjective, but tastes can change and grow if exposed to other influences.

s6igwr,"they probably should but most likely will not, best or nothing i guess"
s6igwr,DJ Khalid would like a word with you.
s6igwr,"Yeah.. I hear you. I was never one into that pop culture of this is best or better than that, or best in slot, or meta whatever. I like what I like, but I know people are different and like different things. Just because I like something, doesn't mean others will as well; and vice versa. However, I like to share what I like (particularly good, uplifting and moving songs to me,) and perhaps, others may also find it to help make their day better."
s6igwr,I'm being totally honest here: I have a better relationship with music since I stopped caring about music and their notes. Idgaf anymore if an album I like has a 3.2 or 3.9 in rym.
s6igwr,"Sorry but all music is not equal. Im a drummer with experience playing a few other instruments. By all means this is just my opinion but if you need a bunch of half naked women to twerk/dance provocatively to make the performance good then maybe the music isn't as good as you might think.  We all have different tastes and what we think is (good)  a music theory professor is going to have a more refined than someone who has never played an instrument or lacks understanding of musical expression.  Somebody said it better than me on a different post.

s6igwr,Nope.
s6igwr,"Depends.

I prefer hard rock and metal, but I can admit that it's not objectively better than other genres. And there's plenty of jazz, bluegrass, ambient, soft rock, reggae and whatnot that I love.

But pop music is inferior and it always will be. 

Pop can take the form of rock, rap, country, electronic, or any genre really. The one thing all pop has in common is that it takes all the least controversial techniques and aesthetics from artists all over the spectrum and packages it to maximize its audience. 

It's lowest common denominator music. Folk music, garage rock, underground, local scenes, experimental, avant garde. . . pretty much anything contrasted with pop is better."
s6igwr,It‚Äôs easy to think so when 90% of reddit only listens to metal
s6igwr,"not sure which is worse, genre snobs hailing their righteousness or the fact that their snobbery bothers you in the least. both are equally petty and both sound just as ignorant as the other! musical preference is SUBJECTIVE!!!

s6wsns,Cover are good but you can also just snag samples from the songs you like and try to build something new around it. It‚Äôs how a lot of artists get around paying the full royalties like they would for cover songs

s62hxg,Michael Jackson- Bad
s62hxg,NOFX- heavy petting zoo
s62hxg,i just noticed yesterday that all of the weeknd's album covers are dumb.
s62hxg,"Beach Boys - Pet Sounds. Brilliant album and I love the cover picture, but the listing of the songs takes up most of the cover and tarnishes it. 

Same with The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour album, but I don‚Äôt care too much for that picture"
s62hxg,"Deftones - ""Around the Fur""

One of the worst covers ever. Even the band has stated they hate it now."
s62hxg,Let just be honest- The only reason this post was made was because of the album Nevermind by Nirvana.
s62hxg,"Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It In People. One of the best albums of the ‚Äò00s indie rock renaissance, but they tried twice with that cover and failed both times. Both are so bland that they somehow become offensive, which is a feat."
s62hxg,Black Sabbath Master of Reality 1971. Epic album with timeless songs. Album cover designed by primary school children testing their spelling
s62hxg,Steely Dan‚Äôs ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy a Thrill‚Äù is just awful. I can barely look at it. Great record though.
s62hxg,"Talking Heads - ‚Äò77     
    
Physically hurts to look at, and not in an interesting way"
s62hxg,"I love Thee Oh Sees, so many albums but wow the album covers are bad"
s62hxg,Led Zeppelin - Houses of the Holy.  I feel like a perv every time I touch it.
s62hxg,Most albums by Yes
s62hxg,Goblin Cock - Bagged and Boarded
s62hxg,Dr. Dre - 2001
s62hxg,The Life of Pablo
s62hxg,"metallica's black album does not do the album justice at all, it could've (should've) been way cooler"
s62hxg,"Some of my favorites with bad album covers:

* [You'd prefer an astronaut](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qx0YtBEDcbpclLlqzRi2o?si=07LVUqKYT2yNO26rJFfxmg), by HUM
* [Fantastic Planet](https://open.spotify.com/album/5hbxMCegyQPhpycfjtlW6I?si=pEEnVQH7QAWPY2k8oOQZsw), by Failure

s62hxg,Hemispheres by Rush. Two dudes standing on a giant floating brain.
s62hxg,"My vote goes to Pink Floyd's *Obscured by Clouds*. Fantastic album that came out right before *Dark Side of the Moon.* But the cover...the cover is literally...obscured by clouds. It's just a highly pixelated blur. [See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscured_by_Clouds) for yourself. How anyone above 16 could have thought that was a super awesome idea - to, like, obscure the album cover of *Obscured by Clouds* with clouds - is totally amazing to me."
s62hxg,"Number one spot goes to Juice WRLD ‚ÄòGoodbye and Good Riddance‚Äô, worst album cover I‚Äôve ever seen and I do not like the album at all, either. (far from a fan)

Feed Me Jack‚Äôs album covers, not a fan of the band anyway but the covers put me off their songs even more.

Also Midnite Vultures by Beck. An overall weird mess.

I also have to say that a lot of popular artists seem to put their faces on their album covers which I don‚Äôt have anything against but it lacks any sort of original, creative, or artistic work on the covers- though yes, portrait photography is an art and a lot of them put twists & meaning into it, album covers have a lot of potential of being a lot more creative."
s62hxg,Michael Jackson - Bad
s62hxg,"Foo Fighters' ""There is Nothing Left to Lose.""

I feel like you can look at every Foo Fighters album cover, see the year it was released and think, ""yeah, it seems like it belongs right around that time.""

But Nothing Left to Lose is just a polaroid of a neck with the shorted logo on it. It's boring for an album released around the time of Y2K and the New Millenium Panic."

s62hxg,"Most NOFX albums have pretty atrocious album art despite being bangers. Pump the valuum, especially"

s62hxg,"Deftones - around the fur. Has some great songs, but that album cover is just gross."
s62hxg,"‚ÄúLust for Life‚Äù by Iggy Pop. That album has some of the wildest, most intense music he ever made, but it looks like he used his high school graduation photo for the cover."
s62hxg,Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.
s62hxg,Nevermind by Nirvana. Not so much because it‚Äôs a bad cover but because the baby on the cover has grown into a man baby and won‚Äôt let it go.
s62hxg,"Counting Crows - August and Everything After 

Amazing album, ugly cover"
s62hxg,Tortoise - TNT

Has to be one of the worst if it turns a fan off from liking the album as a whole (me). Google or Spotify if you haven‚Äôt seen. It has to be top 20 worst album covers with good music in the album."
s62hxg,George Harrison - [Cloud 9](https://www.beatlesbible.com/wp/media/george-harrison-cloud-nine.jpg)
s62hxg,"The Nirvana album with the baby. Not cause it‚Äôs a bad cover because it‚Äôs really smart but because if they didn‚Äôt make it that, the guy who had a photo taken as a baby for it wouldn‚Äôt be shitting on Nirvana and trying to sue them after decades of being proud and owning that he was the ‚ÄúNirvana baby‚Äù"

s64s65,Their TotP performance of this song was brilliantly minimalist.
s64s65,classic
s64s65,Great one
s64s65,"The legend I heard about this track was that they wrote it during a period when they hated playing live shows. The goal of this track was to have something for an encore where they could leave part way through and be half way back to the hotel before it was over. 

I was lucky enough to see them live during a later reunion tour. Bernard Sumner introduced it by saying this song is going to start with me asking ‚ÄúHow does it feel?‚Äù and finishes with me saying ‚ÄúThank you and good night. ‚Äú (and yes, in my case they did stay to the end)"
s64s65,New Order is a great band. It‚Äôs unusual for such a popular song to still be like-able after all this time.
s64s65,like that very much
s64s65,Always been a fan of Bernard Sumner. His songwriting with Joy Division was on a whole different level.
s64s65,"But it's Tuesday, Stuart"
s76a22,"I like all genres of music including jazz.  I think that there are a few factors that push people away from this music.
1.) No lyrics
2.) No noticeable song structure based on the listeners past experience with music, meaning jazz songs are not set up with a verse, chorus, verse etc."
s76a22,"i don't know a lot about jazz, but the local jazz station plays it.  i like piano jazz, but i don't like trumpet jazz.  my friend calls jazz with saxophones in it Hot Tub Jazz.

That's the most i've ever typed the word jazz in a sentence in my life."
s76a22,"i don't know jazz doesn't really do much for me, i listen to quite a variety of music. but jazz is definitely my least explored genre."
s76a22,"I think a lot of people are turned off by dissonant elements in jazz music.

As for me, I recently got into jazz more in-depth than I typically would.  I'm working on a small playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jaI0WJCuOe2fQ9uNcP77X?si=892749884dfe4172) of the jazz songs that I like."
s76a22,"Jazz is too complex for me, straight-up. I also don't really like horns.

I prefer metal, blues, rap and country. I don't really like classical music either. Jazz and classical aren't as ""straightforward"" as the simpler genres of music I like."

s6iobr,People don't like change.
s6iobr,"I'm going to say that it has to do with more of the same. If I could have every Weezer album be exactly more of the Blue Album, I don't know that I wouldn't accept the trade. I think people love the freshman sound. It's visceral. It is what gets the band to where they could be. 

""It's super serious now! We have obtained celebrity! We've got to practice"". Throw a few 8-balls, some hookers, sold out shows, and what seems to be unlimited money; you are now set up for change.  Just my two cents on it for what it is worth."
s6iobr,"People don‚Äôt want a band they like to change bc they liked what they did. I find myself not liking how a lot of bands that I listen to evolved. I gotta respect them for doing their thing, but I don‚Äôt have to listen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
s6iobr,Most people listen to music because they're chasing a feeling. They want comfort food.
s6iobr,"They also have to thread a needle, because there‚Äôs backlash if they don‚Äôt change enough either.  There are lots of bands that get accused of making the same album over and over."
s6iobr,"I was introduced to Slothrust right after The Pact was released and I remember reading the same complaints about that record! I thought The Pact was a brilliant record, and Parallel Timelines grows on me more every time I listen to it. I like every one of their releases.

Sometimes a band's sound can shift in ways fans don't care for. I don't really care for Metallica post Black album, but I also don't get mad about it. A band is entitled to explore any sound or approach they want, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. 

And if you haven't listened to Slothrust do yourself a favor and check them out. Fantastic band, great lyrics, and one of my favorite bands of the last few years."
s6iobr,"If we think of recording artists as truly artists, They should really be creating music that is organically what they happen to be feeling at that point in their creative process. No eye towards commerce at all. That should be a recording artists true evolution."
s6iobr,"Fans dont realise that people grow up. You cant expect a band in their 40s to be as passionate or angry about a topic as they were in their 20s.

Few bands or artists are, and those that pretend to be often feel disingenuous."
s6iobr,"People become fans of an artist because of the themes they enjoyed in their work.

The themes change, frequently from a raw, imperfect, unpolished style to a more careful and practiced, possibly even reserved style

 And people lose interest because it loses the themes that they initially sought, or they're at a point where their interest was fully satisfied."
s6iobr,"""getting better"" is pretty subjective. People fall in love with a bands music and style and when they change it deviates from what their fans liked in the first place. Pretty simple"
s6iobr,"We want bands to stay ""ours."" For what it's worth, I love the newest Slothrust."
s6iobr,"As a Muse fan who accompany them through their experimentation, I have to deal with the toxic fandom asking over and over for them to return to the sound of the first three albums üôÑ"
s6iobr,"I think in some cases the evolution of a band‚Äôs sound is great. For some bands however they stray too far too fast from the sound that their fans know and expect. I can give one example based solely on my reaction to one such evolution. 

In 1991, I heard Pearl Jam for the first time and it was as if I heard music for the first time. Their sound and their lyrics spoke to me in ways that I had not experienced before. 

They released another great album in 1993 (v.s) and I felt that this band might become the greatest band of all time. After the release of VS, they somehow got connected with Neil Young and for their next album in 1994 (Vitology), it sounded less like Pearl Jam and more like a Neil Young cover band. It was jarring. Their next album (No Code) was even more like a Neil Young album and it completely turned me off. I didn‚Äôt buy another Pearl Jam album. I can‚Äôt listen to anything after Vitology without wondering what the fuck happened. 

Their sound changed almost completely between 1993 and 1994. I am sure some folks love their entire discography but for me, they changed too much and too fast."
s6iobr,"I agree. The Who is the prime example of evolving their sound and succeeding in the process. Arctic Monkeys are a good modern example of a band evolving their sound with each album. 

Now, let‚Äôs talk Red Hot Chili Peppers. I agree and disagree with you. So many people glorify their early funk sound, as if to say that is the only good thing they‚Äôve ever done, but I like their more melodic sound more than that. *Californication*, *By the Way*, and *Stadium Arcadium* are all great examples of them evolving their sound. Everything after that, not so much. I feel like they evolved to the point where they just got bored evolving and stuck to a safe sound. They now sound like Red Hot Chili Peppers doing a Red Hot Chili Peppers impression."
s6iobr,Bands become famous for a certain sound then use their new platform to play a different style of music that nobody signed up for!.
s6iobr,"I think it sometimes depends on how.  Like Metallica....the Black album is great music, I don't care what the die-hards say.   Load and Reload ...they were *good*, but definitely not great.  They lack energy and enthusiasm.  St. Anger...that was a *de*evolution.  

Godsmack evolved their sound recently, and man is it better than before.  They didn't lose any punch, but they gained a lot more depth, flow, and melody.  

Ozzy ..he has always evolved his sound.  And it's been more hit than miss.  

There will always be naysayers, though, no matter what.  Some people just don't like change."
s6iobr,"People don't mind even artists evolve to something equally good or better (Bowie, Radiohead), but they dislike when they evolve to something less good (Muse)."
s6iobr,I‚Äôm a huge Slothrust fan so I‚Äôll only comment on that specific aspect of it. I think the main problem with the new album is that their normal sound was lost too fast fans to enjoy if that makes any sense. It would have been great as a Leah side project but as a Slothrust album it‚Äôs missing almost everything that the fans liked about the band.
s6iobr,"I usually think that change in bands is good . At some point you are just repeating yourself . But what Coldplay did should throw them in jail . That crap is criminal . 
Heres an original song and if you like it I  promise I'll never sellout. otherwise it's edm for me with Beyonce : https://youtu.be/ZS-ssLhaQwY"
s6iobr,"My favorite band of all time is Rush.

Rush fans are more forgiving of the band (as is our nature), but when they went a bit too deep into the keyboards, there was some mild backlash.  I remember reading a review of Power Windows that went something like ""the record is so full of percussive flops and synthesizer stabs that you just want to hear Geddy Lee scream 'let's party!' (or some such verbiage).""

I saw them on the next tour for Hold Your Fire - the last album of the synths era - and there was an undercurrent of...dissatisfaction?...when the pre-recorded voice of Aimee Mann came in on ""Time Stand Still.""  Like the fans were sitting there with arms crossed over their chest and thinking ""Rush plays all their own instruments live all the time...what's up with this recorded stuff?""

The great thing about Rush is that - if you watch ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" - even they got it, and went back to being a power trio again focused on drums, bass, and guitar.

The first time I saw them live was on the Grace Under Pressure tour when they were really starting to lean into synths, and the last time was their last tour - R40 - where you got to see the evolution of the band on a number of fronts (from the sound to the stage setup), and that was nice to experience.  

I get the criticism.  They went from being ""Canadian Zeppelin"" to a pastel keyboard based band and then back again.  I still like the old stuff better, but the keyboard era is...okay."
s6iobr,I think it‚Äôs necessary for bands to grow and change their sound but it grinds me when a great original band suddenly change and sound derivative of another band‚Äôs style or at least drop their originality for genre tropes.
s6iobr,"Many good points have already been mentioned. One thing I‚Äòve noticed with myself in the past especially with lesser known bands is the esoteric aspect, being part of the in-crowd, feeling being part of something special. When the band then changes their sound and becomes more successful commercially (or whatever comes first) there‚Äòs a part in me that wants to keep the band to myself. And then of course there‚Äòs the cases where you just don‚Äòt like the evolved sound. Bands have every right to do whatever they want and fans shouldn‚Äòt be too petty about it but then again very often a band may form a part of your identity and some may feel betrayed. Which is nonsense but fandom seldom is rational."
s6iobr,"A lot of fandoms are toxic like that. People don't like change, and there are a lot of bands that actually did get subjectively less interesting after evolving their sound. 

RHCP as per your post are good example of interesting and fun evolution: I love freaky styley as much as stuff they did with Josh, both different both very good.

But if you want something totally different check out King Gizzard - almost every album out of around 18 is a different genre and fans were actually complaining last year that we've had 2 microtonal albums in a row because the sound wasn't evolved enough this time around. Even though some songs of those two were unlike anything else before.

It's like living in a reverse world, best fandom ever."
s6iobr,"The initial listen determines where a person places a band on their music scale of greatness. Some get into a band just for a certain sound that the artist leaves behind as they grow artistically. It‚Äôs hard to capture raw emotion of a live show in an album, so for those people I say, go to the live show and hear what the artist intended."
s6iobr,Bands like slothrust aren‚Äôt evolving per-say.   They are trying to find a sound that more than 27 people will want to listen to.
s6iobr,"because sometimes things that were great become something that grows into something negative, not always the case though"
s6iobr,"A great example of a band that changed a lot is Metallica. They started off as a thrash metal band, but then made the Back Album which ‚Äúsold out‚Äù. Acouple years later released Load and Reload which was more hard rocky. Then in 2003, they busted out St. Anger. I really don‚Äôt want to talk about it, but if you‚Äôre curious, listen to the snare on any track. But with the release of Hardwired-To-Self Destruct, they had a good return to thrash sounding metal"
s6iobr,"I think it‚Äôs cause where that band/sound originally started that‚Äôs where there main beginning listening roots are from ,fact. it‚Äôs always a great exception to further your genre knowledge to show that your band can go out of that main comfort zone, I‚Äôve seen it go good and bad led by many examples through music history. Some artists I feel are sometimes less comfortable with others depending on the life story/origin and background feel for that time."

s79apd,As a bassist I would totally recommend bass. I felt it was pretty easy to pick up. Guitar has a little more going on with chords and such. And if you learn bass first you can transfer some of that knowledge to learning guitar in the future - although that is true vice versa.
s79apd,another question could someone reccomend a bass guitar for cheap?
s79apd,"Step 1: pick 10 of your favorite songs.

Step 2: listen to them back to back

Step 3: play along with an air instrument. Don't think about which one, just do what feels right. 

Step 4: learn that one. It's what you're latching on to when you listen. 

Step 5: learn the others later on."
s79apd,"For beginners: instead of buying a cheap instrument, rent a good one. For two reasons:

1. It's cheaper. It is VERY common that people think they want to learn an instrument, but as soon as they find out that it's not all that easy, they simply quit after a day or two, and sometimes after just a minute or two. You don't want to be stuck with an unused instrument that cost you a lot of money. If you rent and find that you enjoy working at it, THEN you can spend money on a decent instrument. Instruments are generally cheap to rent.

2. It's hard to learn ANY musical instrument (many people will argue with this, but they are not being honest). Don't make it even harder by starting with a shitty instrument that sounds worse than what you were expecting.

Also, when it comes to drums, you can buy an electronic drum kit and use headphones.

Be prepared to take a few lessons, if only to stop yourself from developing bad habits which is easy to do and hard to undo."
s79apd,"Try the drums. Drummers don't get the recognition of guitar players or lead singers but percussion is the way to go, they are the ones who set the time and keep the bad on track"
s79apd,"I can already play basic piano and clarinet.

I have decided to go for Ukulele as its easier than guitar.

A Youtuber called Andy Guitar gives free lessons in both"
s79apd,"Bass is pretty easy to learn, but piano is a really complex system that encompasses all instruments in its theory, so once you get piano down, you can essentially play any instrument. 

Drums imo are more rhythm-based, but are very similar to bass as they both represent rhythm instruments. Just be prepared for a lot of repetition with bass/drums that can dull the experience. You can eventually branch out into more complex guitar playing once you get the chords down, a bass is just an electric guitar with less strings."
s5t2b7,"I'm 35 so this is the era that got me into the Misfits, I remember seeing them with Vampiro in WCW and bought this album not too long after that and became a fan.  I know it's popular to hate Jerry's direction of the band but if it wasn't for him a good chunk of us probably wouldn't know of them, if Danzig had his way they'd be a trivia question."
s5t2b7,It's Sunday.
s5t2b7,Whole famous monsters album is great
s5t2b7,Hard Rock.....ü§£
s5t2b7,Famous monsters slaps. I love this album
s5t2b7,Best graves song
s5t2b7,"I watched the Misfits with Danzig on vocals, Doyle, Jerry, and Dave Lombardo from Slayer on the drums a couple years ago at Psyco Las Vegas. It was one of the best concerts of my life! I couldn‚Äôt get over how spot on they were. They played a long set and pretty much played every Misfits song you‚Äôd ever want to hear (minus the Graves stuff obviously). I‚Äôve seen a lot of legendary bucket list bands past their prime and have been let down so many times, that I was half expecting them to suck, but all I can say is don‚Äôt pass up the chance to see the Misfits with Danzig!"
s5t2b7,"I don‚Äôt like michale graves, but I love this song"
s5t2b7,I love this sound.
s5t2b7,The 50's style song is my favorite version of Punk.
s5t2b7,"I saw them play this at a show in St. John, New Brunswick before the album came out. Signed up for the Fiend Club, bought Evillive II and matching tshirt"
s5t2b7,This album got me super into the Misfits in 2001! Was in a misfits cover band for a few Halloween nights a decade later.
s5t2b7,Great song. So fun to sing along.
s5t2b7,I absolutely adore the Michale Graves Era and this whole album is killer.
s5t2b7,"This was my first concert when I was 14, and my mom was so nervous about me going.  Flash to me slow dancing with a 50 year old punk lady to this song haha."
s5t2b7,I've never listened to these guys before.  I thought the greaser part of their look was coincidental.  I get it now.
s5t2b7,The misfits died in 84‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
s5t2b7,Always a great choice.  Misfits.
s5t2b7,Cool!
s5t2b7,"Even the most hard core Danzig fans love this song.
They may say otherwise, but they like it."
s5t2b7,"Actually their style is called Horror Punk, not Hard Rock üò¨üò¨üò¨but this song is more a Rock Song than the other stuff. Love it anyway ü•∞"
s5t2b7,"love this god damn album

[if you guys want something misfits like‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/ULEYckKnBaw)"
s5t2b7,The Misfits by numbers. Less horror punk more horrific punk for me.
s5t2b7,"Damn, had an ex that used to play this a fair bit on our road trips, a good song for good times"
s5t2b7,One of my favorite misfits song
s5t2b7,My mom passed a few years ago. The misfits were her favourite band. The Officiant asked us to pick a song for end. And this was the song.
s5t2b7,I actually prefer Graves era Misfits over Danzig.
s5t2b7,Fuck Graves he's a proud boy piece of human trash.
s5t2b7,"This album is ok. Lost in Space is a fun track.

https://youtu.be/LjZVHY6UIBA"
s5t2b7,This was one of my friends first dance at their wedding. I could not stop laughing
s5t2b7,Best album they made
s5t2b7,Newfits
s5t2b7,Great song
s5t2b7,I actually really like famous monsters. I do wish they had changed their name to either famous monsters or aMerican psycho because without danzig and without the hardcore its not The Misfits‚Äîbut these albums ARE great
s5t2b7,Do descending angel!!!
s5t2b7,Love this track
s5t2b7,"I met Michael Graves after one of his shows and he is such a humble, awesome guy!  He had Attack Bastard backing him and there was only about 20 people there, but it was one of my favorite concerts ever and I've been to alot, big and small."
s5t2b7,This Misfits album was perfect for the time when it came out. I love the Danzig era and there is no replacing that at all. The Graves timeframe brought a lot of new fans to an all time great band. What I hope that happened was people discovered punk bands from the early-mid 80‚Äôs that they never heard of through listening to this version of the Misfits.
s5t2b7,Was Graves or Danzig better?
s5t2b7,"Danzig vs. Graves aside, Doyle killed it on this album"
s5t2b7,"This song isn‚Äôt all that great , so why I have an undeniable urge to buy a t-shirt?"
s64uvr,"It keeps the artist in your Release Radar, it also gives the artist more opportunities to submit songs to Spotify's editorial playlists. If they just released the album in one go then they would only be able to pitch one song to Spotify for playlisting - essentially wasting 9 opportunities. I know Underoath are popular and have over 1 million monthly listeners so their songs could very likely get placement without this method but this strategy is used to keep the Spotify algorithm ticking in their favour and for it to keep pushing their music to more people.  


I agree with you on how it makes albums feel less special btw but artists are having to play the algorithm game now."
s64uvr,"As annoying as this is, it is strategic. This is the response to the Spotify algorithms for playlist placement and visibility. My band will be doing this same thing. Do we want to? No, it‚Äôs annoying. But we want to increase our audience as much as possible. Artist make virtually no money from Spotify so it‚Äôs become a tool for visibility."
s64uvr,"This isn't a new concept in the digital age. This is just how the music industry has worked since it was capitalized.

Back when radio was still relevant they would release 2 to 3 tracks within the 6 to 9 months before an album came out to get people excited for it and then would pull 1 to 2 of the tracks when the album dropped just to get you to buy the album so you could hear the song again. They would also regularly release singles on vinyl, A-track, and cassette leading up to the album coming out so people would spend money numerous times for the same song."
s64uvr,"The industry is going through a major sea-change as it moves away from physical media (cds, albums, tapes, etc) being the primary way music is released to online streaming services being the way to go. There's going to be some growing pains as they figure out the best way to do this."
s64uvr,"It‚Äôs called a waterfall release.

It serves a few purposes, most of which have already been mentioned here; playlist pitching, new releases popping up, getting more plays from continuing through the album, etc"
s64uvr,I agree completely. Especially when it seems like the best songs off the albums were the singles that had already come out. Makes the whole experience of a new album drop underwhelming
s64uvr,"Stereolab did this in 2006 with Fab Four Suture, releasing 45s with two songs each until 12 songs were compiled as the full album. 

Many classified it as a compilation album, but I just saw it as a creative tactic for collectibility as a precursor for the album release.

[Fab Four Suture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_Four_Suture)"
s64uvr,Just a sign of the times my friend
s64uvr,"I had this exact same problem with th Remi Wolf album. It's a great album, but I heard 70% of it in advance. I like the level of freedom artists have now, but it has changed the album experience. As a music fan that's a big deal. I love albums and the concept of one unified piece of work."
s64uvr,"Completely agree on this. In this same vein, Memphis May Fire just announced an album to be released at the end of April: 11 tracks and 6 of those are singles that are out already. I get why artists do this now; a steady stream of new releases keeps them being promoted by streaming services algorithms. But, at the same time, having already heard over half of the album really takes away from the experience of listening through the whole thing.

It's annoying, but I get why it happens."
s64uvr,How else do musicians keep up the hype when people aren‚Äôt buying albums anymore?
s64uvr,I can't stand Spotify. Only used it to support upcoming artists who only released said content on Spotify. Thankfully they usually move it to other platforms after a week. And in case anybody didn't know there is a hacked Spotify you can use for free Spotify. Xmanager
s64uvr,"Imagine if pink Floyd had done this with ""the wall"". I guess concept albums are a relic of the past now."
s64uvr,Welcome to the future of music. Gone are the days of albums. Now its all carefully curated singles
s64uvr,Agree 100%. It‚Äôs so annoying and makes the album releases underwhelming. Happened with a few albums for me last year. Half of an album is released as singles now!
s64uvr,"It helps gain traction or showcase an artist you listen to. 

Its also a throwback to the time of buying vinyl or cassette singles before an album was released.. This was a norm."
s64uvr,the ecosystem as a whole is currently a mess‚Äîand an exhausting one. I actually just published [an article](https://jakeposner.medium.com/opinion-the-great-follower-disconnect-fixing-the-plumbing-of-the-music-delivery-pipeline-91cc47bd49ff) with some thoughts on the matter that might be worth sharing here with regard to fixing the greater issue at hand to create a bit more balance for all :)
s64uvr,I'm releasing two singles from my thirteen song album before the album releases.  I agree that releasing a lot more than that makes the album underwhelming.
s64uvr,Albums no longer matter for Spotify users.
s64uvr,Album just means official playlist
s64uvr,"Blame Spotify, not the artist. Spotify doesn't pay you well for spread out plays on an album. They will pay way more for a single with high amount of plays."
s64uvr,"The industry as a whole has reverted to a singles market rather than an album market. Releasing it like this means the singles make more money, keep an artist in peoples minds with constant releases, doesn‚Äôt overwork artists or others in the industry by having to write extra songs (because they‚Äôre all on the album anyway) and also means they can be in many varying styles to capture a larger audience. Back in the day, an album had to at least sound like the same band played all the songs. Now you can have one ‚Äúalbum‚Äù with a plethora of different styles song to song that doesn‚Äôt make a cohesive sounding album so much, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter because you already know all the songs."
s64uvr,Partially because people don't really buy albums anymore or listen to albums all the way through. Most don't at least. So releasing singles is better from a financial standpoint.
s6cbqo,I remember listening to this with album all throughout high-school. It was basically my anthem.
s6cbqo,"I can‚Äôt hear this song without thinking of this scene from Twister.

https://youtu.be/JNiKseeX_Ic"
s6cbqo,Love listening to this one with the volume at 11!
s6cbqo,wait for the ricochet...
s6ys5h,"I'd say it all comes down to advertising and funds associated to generating a buzz, or money to pay a stream site to host your songs.

If one is unable to figure out today's recording options,  that's on them."
s6ys5h,Don't waste a bunch of money on pro tools is a great start. Not worth it.
