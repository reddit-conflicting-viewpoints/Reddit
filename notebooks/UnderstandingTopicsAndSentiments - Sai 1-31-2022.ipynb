       " 'This is a little bit out there, but I think this is an interesting way to think about / apply the question of P=NP. Think about cellular life. Biologically, for many organisms (think simple multi cellular; plants, things that don’t have super complex brains) we understand the structure and function of literally every single atom and cell that they are made of. But we are unable to synthesize these organisms we know so much about ourselves in a lab despite knowing how to perfectly verify nearly every piece of their structure by looking at them. Translating to the P=NP problem, the “verification” of a problem can be thought of as examining every single piece of an organism and confirming that it is what we think it is. The “solving” of the problem would consist of creating such an organism from scratch, from non-living material. Despite knowing how every single piece of a multi cellular organism works and being able to verify them, humans cannot solve them by creating them in a lab. What is the only current known way to “create” life? By waiting for nature’s random iteration to try and fail over billions of years and trillions of “guess and check” iterations. If evolution can be thought of as the only way to achieve the “solution”, until we can figure out a way to synthesize complex multi cellular organisms from scratch, nature’s answer to the P=NP problem is that verifying a solution does not imply that it can be solved. Only guessed and checked over trillions of years.This may not make sense but I think it’s an interesting way to think of how nature sort of answers one of humanity’s biggest questions.',\n",

       " \"&#x200B;🔵 Singular Value Decomposition 🔵\\U0001fa84 Remember from the [post on eigenvectors](/): eigenvectors of a matrix are special vectors that only get scaled when the matrix is applied to them. While EVD (eigenvalue decomposition) can only be applied to special matrices (diagonalizable matrices) SVD is a generalization of EVD and can be applied to any rectangular matrix.🧩 Like prime factorization where a number is broken down to its prime factors (simpler pieces = prime numbers in this case); SVD factorizes the matrix into simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices. This factorization or decomposition comes in handy for many applications some of which I briefly touch upon later.🏥🦴 Time for (somewhat of) an analogy: You can think of SVD as an x-ray of a matrix. It provides us with simpler pieces that constitute the matrix and by looking at these simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices we can say a lot about the matrix in question. Things like its (pseudo-) inverse, rank, null-space, range among other things can be easily determined the same way a doctor can say a lot with an x-ray scan of your body.🔨 The Singular Value decomposition breaks the original matrix into 3 pieces: 2 unitary matrices and a rectangular diagonal matrix. You can draw a parallel with the Eigenvalue decomposition equation and see exactly how SVD has a more general form.🔄 With the help of the Singular Value decomposition we can explain what happens to an arbitrary vector when a matrix M is applied to it. Since M can be broken down into simpler pieces, we can represent the matrix M by a rotation, followed by scaling (by the singular values) and another rotation. So if you had a circle it would first be rotated then stretched by the singular values (becoming an ellipse) and finally be rotated to end up as a rotated ellipse.🗜️ There are numerous applications of SVD. Perhaps you could comment on the ones that I missed but you know about. One of the nicest things you can get is the pseudo-inverse of a matrix without doing crazy matrix inversion. This is because the simple pieces that SVD provides are extremely easy to invert making inversion of the original matrix child's play. SVD is heavily applied in solving numerical problems such as solving linear equations that so frequently pop up in engineering.🎥 Data compression and computing low-rank approximations make it handy for compressing images and videos so you can watch cat videos without buffering. And of course, SVD has also been used for ranking web pages like Google's Pagerank algorithm does so you can find your favorite recipe with a quick search.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

       " \"Hello, I was reading [this](-the-ways-to-reach-nth-step-using-step-1-2-and-3-but-take-step-3-only-k-tim) SO question and the given answer.This is basically the juice of the problem statement:> Count the ways to reach nth step using step 1,2 and 3 but take step 3 only k times.OP had the following recursive solution and asked for a top-down iterative approach:```int countstep(int n,int k){    if(n<0)        return 0;    if(n==0)        return 1;    int total_step=countstep(n-1,k)+countstep(n-2,k);    if(k>0)        total_step+=countstep(n-3,k-1);    return total_step;}```Someone posted an iterative approche using an `n*k` table. I was thinking that this problem is a modified version of the tribonacci numbers where after `k=0` it reduces to the fibonacci numbers for the rest, where `n1=1`, `n2=2`, `n3=4 (if k > 0)` and for each `T(ni)` we calculate `T(ni-1)+T(ni-2)+ T(ni-3) if k > 0` else just `T(ni-1)+T(ni-2)`. This would reduce the problem to constant space, since we just need to keep track of the last 3 steps at most, and `n` time complexity. I'm not sure about my thinking. Can anyone advise if this is correct or I'm missing something?What makes me doubt my thinking is this: We could use our `k`s at different points of the path. They don't need to be exhausted all at the beginning.Thank you in advance.\",\n",

       " \"**Problem statement:**>Write a function, which creates a random graph of a certain size as follows. The function takes two parameters. The first parameter is the number of vertices n. The second parameter p (1 >= p >= 0) is the probability that an edge exists between a pair of nodes. In particular, after instantiating a graph with n vertices and 0 edges, go over all possible vertex pairs one by one, and for each such pair, put an edge between the vertices with probability p. The graph representation is an adjacency matrix.**Proposed algorithm:**    1- Create a bool matrix (2d nested array) of size n*n initialized with false.    2- Run a loop over the rows:      - Run an inner loop over the columns:        - if row_index != col_index do:            - curr_p = random() // random() returns a number between 0 and 1 inclusive            - if curr_p <= p: set matrix[row_index][col_index] = true              - For an undirected graph, also set matrix[col_index][row_index] = true        **Note:**    Since we are setting both cells (both directions) in the matrix    in case of a probability hit, we could potentially set an edge 2 times.    This doesn't corrupt the correctnes of the probability    and isn't much additional work. It helps to keep the code clean.        If you want to optimize this solution, you could run the loop    such that you only visit the lower-left triangle (excluding the diagonal)    and just mirror the results you get for those cells to the upper-right triangle.Now, someone told me that without the optimization the algorithm is wrong since it calculates the propability of edge existence twice.  In their words:>With the current code in the undirected case, the probability that matrix\\\\[0\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\] will be set is the probability that the random number in the iteration with col=0/row=1 or in the iteration with col=1/row=0 is smaller than p. That probability is 1-(1-p)\\\\^2.&#x200B;At first I thought they were right, but thinking more about it it occured to me that since the random number generations are independent of each other and since we don't need 2 false (or 2 trues) to set or unset an edge, the probability calculation of the algorithm is correct. If their argument was correct, it would be like saying when you throw a 6 on a 6 sided dice, your chances of getting a 6 next time are less than 1/6. In other words, it looks like the [Gambler's fallacy]('s_fallacy) on their part.&#x200B;I hope I've managed to convey the problem and arguments in full. If not, please ask.What I'm looking for is feedback on which argument is correct. Thank you very much in advance.\",\n",

Once this takes place the OS controls the remainder of operations. - when you plug your computer into the wall, electrical signals are sent in clock cycles that run at some frequency all the time, either idle or active. These signals are always looking for data to transfer via the bus to read, but they are essentially always running (this is the part I'm shaky on I think) - when you write and compile a program say hello world, you have organized some high level code into what can be translated into machine code and binary. When you executed this is sent to the ram, where the clock frequency (always looking) activates logic gates based on what was sent, and tells you what the output it.- if you wanted to use an embedded controller to run a motor the same applies where the programmer writes readable code which can be converted to binary, and is sent to the pinouts in such a way that causes some actuation to happen (such as alternate pulses to a stepper motor) Am I on the right track here ?

The y-intercept should be 2 in my sketch.]()🔵 Gradient descent 🔵💾 A more detailed post this time but I wanted to make sure I touch upon some basics first before diving into gradient descent itself. This is mainly so that it is more inclusive and no one feels left behind if they have missed what gradient is and if you already know what it is you get to brush up on the concept.🏃 Although a relatively simple optimization algorithm, gradient descent (and its variants) has found an irreplaceable place in the heart of machine learning. This is majorly due to the fact that it has shown itself to be quite handy when optimizing deep neural networks and other models. The models behind the latest advances in ML and computer vision are majorly optimized using gradient descent and its variants like Adam and gradient descent with momentum.⛰️ The gradient of a function is a vector that points to the direction of the steepest ascent. The length or the magnitude of this vector gives you the rate of this increase.🔦 Time for an analogy: it is nightfall and you are on top of a hill and want to get to the village down low in the valley. Fortunately, you have a trusty flashlight that helps you see the steepest direction locally around you despite the darkness. You take each step in the direction of the steepest descent using the flashlight and reach the village at the bottom fairly quickly.📐 Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the parameters of a function. It uses 3 critical pieces of information: your current position (x\\\\_i), the direction in which you want to step (gradient of f at x\\\\_i), and the size of your step.🧗The gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent but because we need to minimize we reverse the direction by multiplication with -1.🎮 This toy example illustrates how gradient descent works in practice. We compute the gradient of the function that needs to be optimized i.e. the differentiation of the function with respect to the parameters. This gradient gives us the information we need about the landscape of the function i.e. the steepest direction where we should move in order to minimize the function. A point to keep in mind: gamma the step size (also called the learning rate) is a hyperparameter.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

       " '&#x200B;🔵 Parametric and non-parametric statistics 🔵  🧑\\u200d💻 If you have written code before you have heard of a parameter. It is what a function takes as input to do some computation on and return an output. Similarly, probability distributions have parameters. These define the properties of the distribution.  🔔 In the case of a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are its parameters. The mean controls the position of the distribution while the standard deviation controls the spread or \"peakiness\" of the bell curve.  ⛷️ In the parametric approach, the model consists of a finite set of parameters that characterize it. The big assumption that a parametric model makes is that the model will do well on the task if the underlying distribution from which your data is sampled matches the model. If that is not the case the model and data mismatch will hurt the performance on the task you care about.  🤸 A non-parametric model does not rely on parametric assumptions and is generally more flexible. It is a good choice if you don\\'t have any prior knowledge about what could be a good model that reflects your data distribution. A histogram is a good example that can model points sampled from an arbitrary distribution.  🧐 However, there is no free lunch: you will need enough data points to get a good approximation otherwise the histogram will look nothing like the underlying distribution.  \\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you like such content and would like to steer the topics I cover, feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments.',\n",

This means that the k-means algorithm only requires the data points and does not need the corresponding cluster that each point belongs to as this is what the algorithm figures out.✨ The clusters are found by allocating points in such a way that the total variance of the points within each cluster (intra-cluster variance) is reduced or minimized. Although it iterates quite fast, the k-means algorithm can have varying cluster formations based on the initialization. It has been widely implemented in many software packages. The scikit-learn package for python is the one that I have used most often.🔁 The most common method to perform the clustering is iterative. It alternates between two steps: (1) assigning each point to a cluster based on the point's closeness (or distance) to the cluster center and (2) updating the cluster center (called mean or centroid; hence the name k-means one for each of the k clusters) based on all the points that belong to this particular cluster. The iterations are usually performed until the centroids stabilize (converge) between consecutive iterations.🤓 K-means is popular in scenarios where the data is known to consist of multiple groups (distributions) but it is unknown which point belongs to which group (cluster). It can be used for data analysis and splitting data that comes from multiple distributions, image segmentation, color quantization among other things.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces.

I can simply change the value of `age` directly because I have access to it as I am changing from the same scope.A reason I could think of for creating a pointer to a variable in the same scope is that it might be useful to have pointers point to a variable in the same scope because it would make the naming easy and referencing to the value in huge codebases would be made easier, but I do not think that this is a good use case. The main purpose of pointers is to stop the wastage of memory by copying of the values stored in a variable to another variable but if we are creating pointers, we are of course storing them in a variable which is taking memory so we are back to square one. This might not be the case where variables store a lot of data, this is true for variables that store less data than the memory address itself.My question is that is there any use for creating pointers that point to variables in the same scope or they are never used like that.

       " \"My question is about why LSP requires contravariance in the parameters of the subtype's inherited methods.And more to that, if following LSP means that I can pass in a subtype wherever a parent type is expected, then why couldn't the inherited methods of the subtype be covariant in the parameters?Does the fact that you can't be more specific when passing parameters to a subtype's inherited methods itself violate LSP?Edit: Thanks to u/Probablynotabadguy I think I understand this.If you have a type T and a subtype S, then for all intents and purposes, S IS a T.And so of course the substitution portion holds that if you have a function `foo(T)` that you should be able to pass in an S - because we just said an S IS a T, right?That part I understood. However, because anything provable of type T should be provable for type S, that includes it's methods. And so the contravariance of the subtypes methods is precisely because it's trying to preserve the provability of the subtype relationship.My apologies, I know that's probably a lot of the same words.[Code](+184%2C+195%2C+1%29&t=vscode&wt=none&l=text%2Fx-php&ds=true&dsyoff=42px&dsblur=68px&wc=true&wa=true&pv=56px&ph=56px&ln=false&fl=1&fm=Hack&fs=14px&lh=133%25&si=false&es=2x&wm=false&code=class%2520Speaker%2520%257B%250A%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520%2524word%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520LoudSpeaker%2520extends%2520Speaker%2520%257B%250A%2520%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520strtoupper%28%2524word%29%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520ScreamingSpeaker%2520extends%2520LoudSpeaker%2520%257B%250A%2520%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520strtoupper%28%2524word%29%2520.%2520%27%21%21%21%27%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520Animal%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520public%2520function%2520speak%28LoudSpeaker%2520%2524speaker%29%253A%2520string%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520return%2520%2524speaker-%253Espeak%28self%253A%253Aclass%29%253B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520Cat%2520extends%2520Animal%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520Why%2520am%2520I%2520not%2520allowed%2520to%2520accept%2520ScreamingSpeaker%2520here%253F%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520According%2520to%2520LSP%2520I%2520can%2520only%2520accept%2520either%2520LoudSpeaker%2520or%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520it%27s%2520parent%2520class%2520Speaker.%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520public%2520function%2520speak%28LoudSpeaker%2520%2524speaker%29%253A%2520string%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520return%2520%2524speaker-%253Espeak%28self%253A%253Aclass%29%253B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Afunction%2520makeAnimalSpeak%28Animal%2520%2524animal%29%2520%257B%250A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520According%2520to%2520LSP%2520I%2520shouldn%27t%2520pass%2520in%2520LoudSpeaker%2520here%253F%250A%2509return%2520%2524animal-%253Espeak%28new%2520Speaker%29%253B%250A%257D%250A%250AmakeAnimalSpeak%28new%2520Cat%29)\",\n",

And while I was making a prototype of the BIOS I thought of ways the computer detects memory and how much there is, but cant think of any. I tried looking it up but cant find any good explanations.

For example if white was 0-1 blue 1-2 yellow 2-3 and so on so forth we could expand the possibilities.We can't expand so far, on the 0 being off and 1 being on, so to introduce colours into fibre optic we could essentially assign colours a number to achieve different out comes.We know fibre is faster than conventional powered connections.

First of all, I'm sorry if this post can be a little bit confusing, I'm trying to gather all I have understood so far to make it as clear as possible.So, I am attending a Logical Networks class, and we started some days ago talking about sequential circuits. Today, our professor introduced us to synchronous and asynchronous circuits, but not in the same way I found online.He introduced them by saying this:Basically an asynchronous circuit is a circuit that whatever the state and the input (q1,I) you consider, will always end up in a steady state (qn, I), where if you keep I as an input you'll keep staying in the qn state.And, contrary to this, he told us that synchronous circuits are circuits where not all states and inputs have this property.So what does that specifically mean? I struggle to understand the concept, as some of the example he gave us for synchronous circuits (one of them was a machine that was able to recognise if there was a 101 sequence in the input) seemed to have the steady state property I talked about before, so I think I might be missing something.That said, he then explained us that for that reason (not every state with an input I will end up in a steady state) we need an external synching (a clock) and a memory to make a state steady. Why is that? And why don't we need that for asynchronous circuits?Lastly, he talked about how some of these machines need just an impulse or a longer signal to work (and for example an asynchronous machine cannot recognise a '00' input as it operates when an input changes, so it can only tell that the last input was a (for example) 1 and this one is a 0). How do you tell that? Hope this was clear, thank you for everyone who chooses to spend their time to help me understand :)Oh and, don't take my words for something so accurate of what our professor told us, since I am trying to rephrase these things from what i have understood.\",\n",

Programming languages do not matter much. The core concepts of programming matter a lot more than programming languages but still a lot of people want to learn more and more programming languages. Senior software engineers know this that programming languages don\\'t matter as you can learn a programming language thoroughly well in a night if you know the concepts well. By concepts I mean all the things that are applied while making a product(e.g. a web app), if you know compiler design, it would be incredibly easy to grasp a language, that is where concepts pay off.This problem\\'s cause is bad platforms and bootcamps but I would not name them.

We feed 01 (assuming we are working with two bits of data) into x&#x200B;3. 01 is fed into the accumulator, and the output is 01 because we added nothing to 013, We begin the feedback. x still remains 01 because it had not been updated. y is now 01 because we fed the output into y.

I digress, but it was to illustrate I have somewhat of an idea of what I'm doing.The reset signal from the register is sent indicates the end of the loop.As for the initialization, the load signal indicates to replace the state of S. In other words, initialize S.So, to recap:The register does the following ( slight over simplification):1. CLK = State Change2. LD = Initializes3. Reset = Control\",\n",

       " 'I’d like to propose a modified version of the Turing test that I believe no computer program could be written to pass. I believe this modification makes the test only passable by humans because it makes purpose-driven seeking of information the independent variable and not the provision of answers to pre-defined questions. This lack of having a pre-defined nature is the heart of the claim because, though artificial intelligence (hereafter “A.I.”) can be self-aware, it cannot be self-defined.In the modified Turing test, there are two (2) apparent Turing tests taking place in two separate rooms. Finally, there is a third room that will be explained at the end. In the first room, a typical Turing test is run. This means there are two humans and a computer in the first room. The “investigator” human asks the questions and receives the answers, thus, we can generate two transcripts that have identical questions and are only different in their answers. This is standard. In the second room, there are two computers and one human. The “investigator” is itself a computer that has already passed the standard Turing test. Thus, in this second room, it is the computer program that is actually serving the role of trying to distinguish between the answers of a computer and human. Again, we can receive two transcripts of the Q & A.The human investigator and the A.I. investigator In both of the first two rooms must be provided sufficient time for their questions and interactions with the computer and the human that they will end up judging. They must feel satisfied that they can make an intelligent guess in their own Turing test attempts. Finally, in the third room, we have our real investigator, This investigator will compare the four (4) transcripts and judge which of the two rooms had a human questioner and which of the two rooms had a computer program questioner. Thus, the true object of the examination is to see whether a computer program could match a human in asking the questions in a Turing test as opposed to answering them. Assuming a large enough amount of data, i.e., sufficient questioning and a long enough time given for the “interview process,” I do not believe a computer program can be designed that could pass this modified Turing test. My hypothesis is that because the “investigator” side of the traditional Turing test will be filled with questions that will make it apparent that a human is doing the asking. Importantly, the human investigator and the computer investigator in the first two rooms must NOT know that they are actually the subsections of the third room test. This means that the A.I. Investigator (who already passed the traditional Turing test) will now know that it should be trying to imitate a human.The point of the modified Turing test proposal, in summation, is to show that the A.I that passed the Turing test can only do so when it is, knowingly, the object of the study. Providing the second layer into the experiment would turn the A.I. into the apparent “studier” and, yet, unbeknownst to the computer, still actually the object of the study.This proposed modified Turing test will allow for a better barrier to defining humanity from computer programs should the hypothesis hold true that artificial intelligence will not be able to pass this modified version of the Traditional Turing test.Please feel free to consider how this modified Turing test would work should the experiment ever take place.',\n",

The website was created on 2008 and has accumulated a large amount of crowd wisdom about the software development industry. Here we analyse this data to examine trends in the grouping of technologies and their users into different subcommunities. In our work we analysed all questions, answers, votes and tags from Stack Overflow between 2008 and 2020. We generated a series of user-technology interaction graphs and applied community detection algorithms to identify the biggest user communities for each year, to examine which technologies those communities incorporate, how they are interconnected and how they evolve through time. The biggest and most persistent commu-nities were related to web development. In general, there is little movement between communities; users tend to either stay within the same community or not acquire any score at all.

       " \"𝗤𝗨𝗘𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡 𝗦𝗨𝗠𝗠𝗔𝗥𝗬:If your RAM uses 256 bit memory modules wouldn’t you need more than 8 bits for your data? Because if you only have 8 digits wouldn’t they all have to be used for the 256 addresses leaving no digits left to use as the opcode? This question stems from confusion on two Crash Course YouTube video.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟 𝗤𝗨𝗘𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡:I am confused by two crash course videos. In the first video they created the RAM using 8 256-bit memory modules (16 latches x 16 latches). So an 8 bit number can be broken up into one bit in each memory module allowing for 256 memory addresses for 256 bytes.In the second video they break the 8 bit number at an address into 4 bits for an opcode and the other 4 bits for an address. They reduced the number of addresses to 16 which makes sense since 4 bits can only produce 16 numbers.This is why I am asking how it would work if you wanted 256 addresses. If you still want 16 instructions you would still need a 4-bit opcode, but wouldn't you also need 8 more bits for the 256 addresses bringing your data at each address to 12 bits? Wouldn't this mean you need 12 memory modules instead of 8?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗞𝗦:-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye&index=7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye&index=8-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗜𝗠𝗘𝗥:Sorry if this question makes no sense.
