       "1  two important info to remember:\\n\\n1. prim's algo is greedy, which means it always take the best candidate out of a pool of options. this is relevant for the cut property as we always take the edge with smallest cost out of those edges that connect a node that was already selected and a node still to select\\n2. a tree has the same nodes as the starting graph G={V,E}, just less edges\\n\\nthe thing about cuts is that they let you select node after node without worrying about  cycles - starting from whatever node J, your cut only contains J; J must be part of the MST, so we select the edge with minimum cost (this part should be clear). now the cut expansion: we add the node that was the other endpoint to the selected edge and we call it K: K is now part of our cut. this means that after this step we have a subtree made by the cut {J,K}.\\n\\nnext step: add another node with the above reasoning (we call it L). here is the trick: we now have a subtree T={J,K,L}, and since the cut only lets...   \n",

       "1  two important info to remember:\\n\\n1. prim's algo is greedy, which means it always take the best candidate out of a pool of options. this is relevant for the cut property as we always take the edge with smallest cost out of those edges that connect a node that was already selected and a node still to select\\n2. a tree has the same nodes as the starting graph G={V,E}, just less edges\\n\\nthe thing about cuts is that they let you select node after node without worrying about  cycles - starting from whatever node J, your cut only contains J; J must be part of the MST, so we select the edge with minimum cost (this part should be clear). now the cut expansion: we add the node that was the other endpoint to the selected edge and we call it K: K is now part of our cut. this means that after this step we have a subtree made by the cut {J,K}.\\n\\nnext step: add another node with the above reasoning (we call it L). here is the trick: we now have a subtree T={J,K,L}, and since the cut only lets...   \n",

If you look closely The edges which are in **T** all are inside **X** and there is no edge in **T** which crosses the cut i.e. **(X,V-X)**.  \\n\\n\\nWhen we added edge **e** to **T**, Then that is the only edge which is crossing the cut **(X,V-X)** at that particular Iteration and Accroding to the **Lonely Cut Property** addition of edge **e** doesn’t add any cycle.  \\n\\n\\nI am adding my finding feel free to comment ---> [https://imgur.com/a/GWH5JzC](https://imgur.com/a/GWH5JzC)   \n",

       "      <td>two important info to remember:\\n\\n1. prim's algo is greedy, which means it always take the best candidate out of a pool of options. this is relevant for the cut property as we always take the edge with smallest cost out of those edges that connect a node that was already selected and a node still to select\\n2. a tree has the same nodes as the starting graph G={V,E}, just less edges\\n\\nthe thing about cuts is that they let you select node after node without worrying about  cycles - starting from whatever node J, your cut only contains J; J must be part of the MST, so we select the edge with minimum cost (this part should be clear). now the cut expansion: we add the node that was the other endpoint to the selected edge and we call it K: K is now part of our cut. this means that after this step we have a subtree made by the cut {J,K}.\\n\\nnext step: add another node with the above reasoning (we call it L). here is the trick: we now have a subtree T={J,K,L}, and since the cut only lets...</td>\n",

       "1  two important info to remember:\\n\\n1. prim's algo is greedy, which means it always take the best candidate out of a pool of options. this is relevant for the cut property as we always take the edge with smallest cost out of those edges that connect a node that was already selected and a node still to select\\n2. a tree has the same nodes as the starting graph G={V,E}, just less edges\\n\\nthe thing about cuts is that they let you select node after node without worrying about  cycles - starting from whatever node J, your cut only contains J; J must be part of the MST, so we select the edge with minimum cost (this part should be clear). now the cut expansion: we add the node that was the other endpoint to the selected edge and we call it K: K is now part of our cut. this means that after this step we have a subtree made by the cut {J,K}.\\n\\nnext step: add another node with the above reasoning (we call it L). here is the trick: we now have a subtree T={J,K,L}, and since the cut only lets...   \n",

If you look closely The edges which are in **T** all are inside **X** and there is no edge in **T** which crosses the cut i.e. **(X,V-X)**.  \\n\\n\\nWhen we added edge **e** to **T**, Then that is the only edge which is crossing the cut **(X,V-X)** at that particular Iteration and Accroding to the **Lonely Cut Property** addition of edge **e** doesn’t add any cycle.  \\n\\n\\nI am adding my finding feel free to comment ---> [https://imgur.com/a/GWH5JzC](https://imgur.com/a/GWH5JzC)   \n",

If you lack background in math, Then you might focus more on early lectures. Students coming from non-CS background are highly welcomed, including engineering, physics, and pure-math. Especially if they were interested in computational methods. We hope they contribute to CS students a new perspective about computation.\\n\\nWe hope to initiate a community, Where you can mutually contribute and benefit from others' experiences, skills, and backgrounds. You are welcome to ask questions, share your solutions to be reviewed by others, and even suggest further problems/topics.\\n\\nWe plan to complete two weeks of the course on one month, ...</td>\n",

If you lack background in math, Then you might focus more on early lectures. Students coming from non-CS background are highly welcomed, including engineering, physics, and pure-math. Especially if they were interested in computational methods. We hope they contribute to CS students a new perspective about computation.\\n\\nWe hope to initiate a community, Where you can mutually contribute and benefit from others' experiences, skills, and backgrounds. You are welcome to ask questions, share your solutions to be reviewed by others, and even suggest further problems/topics.\\n\\nWe plan to complete two weeks of the course on one month, ...   \n",

I was under the impression that it would flip down to all 0s and move us back to 12/31/69 but I found out I was wrong and that it will just flip the sign when that happens and move us back to 12/13/1901.\\n\\nBut why was time stored as a signed integer anyway?  Was there an expected need to work with negative time?  If it was unsigned wouldn't that buy us a few more decades to procrastinate before needing to fix it?   \n",

And I know machines ARE NOT a human brain (which is, I assume, tons of times more complex), but I’m just curious about how such a complex thing (but simpler than the brain) as a computer could destroy itself.\\n\\nIf it can, how would the computer do so? Does it need to be preprogrammed to do it? Or does it need an external posterior intervention (like an alien virus or a code or something generated inside itself). Sorry for my poor vocabulary in this area, I really have no idea.   \n",

The heat dissipation required as a result of the power demand could be an issue without added cooling.\\n\\nIs there another reason why a better CPU isn’t used in a raspberry pi?   \n",

This cannot be understated. I'm nearly speechless. Computers CANNOT THINK. And no matter how clever our algorithms are going to get, they will only be able to produce work within the confines of said algorithm. That means innovation will still come from humans, because it cannot come from machines.\\n\\nAnd in order to create software, someone has to tell the machines precisely what is desired. It almost sounds like... Programming... Business people and non-engineers with no idea how computers work or the nuances of computer science and software will never be able to capture the requirements and edge cases of the thing they desire.

(Note that this isn't about knowing the math - I'm going to learn Calculus and Linear Algebra Ok, that's not the problem, it's more about knowing how it works underneath)   \n",

This cannot be understated. I'm nearly speechless. Computers CANNOT THINK. And no matter how clever our algorithms are going to get, they will only be able to produce work within the confines of said algorithm. That means innovation will still come from humans, because it cannot come from machines.\\n\\nAnd in order to create software, someone has to tell the machines precisely what is desired. It almost sounds like... Programming... Business people and non-engineers with no idea how computers work or the nuances of computer science and software will never be able to capture the requirements and edge cases of the thing they desire.

To see a whole crowd living in the moment and seeing the performer with my eyes instead of the screen of the phone in my view. I barely had a chance to go to one or two concerts before they become a sea of phone screens as I'm not particularly old but I remember a sea of lighters during a slow song and I remember seeing a crowd there to see and listen to live music and it was amazing. I'm sure lots of people disagree with me but that's why it would be cool for not all concerts to be phone free so that everyone can enjoy concerts the way they prefer.   \n",

I hid under the back porch, smell of damp summer earth cool under my hands, ducking, scrunching my shoulders tight to avoid the rusty nails waiting patiently above for my back or skull to forget them. The tingling along my back and neck kept reminding me, don't stand up.

Memories from that time are a rare species — lobbing in like huge bumblebees on transparent wings, buzzing old Remington shavers torn free from those thick and brittle wires tangled in webs under our porch where I loved to crawl and hide; black snaking wires disappearing up through floors and humming into wall and socket. I still hear them. I hid under the back porch, smell of damp summer earth cool under my hands, ducking, scrunching my shoulders tight to avoid the rusty nails waiting patiently above for my back or skull to forget them. The tingling along my back and neck kept reminding me, don't stand up. Under the back porch, a place tinged with danger and smelling of earth, the air tastes faintly of mold and hollyhocks twining around the trellises that I see only the bottoms of, speckled gold by the shafts of sun slipping through high elm branches in the backyard, weaving shadows like Grandma'...   \n",

       "5865  “MAN IS LIKE A SPRING FLOWER” was a great suggestion, looking into the backstory I became aware of its inspiration in the artist’s abusive experiences while in a relationship with Marshall, but what I didn’t realize before going down the rabbit hole was that Marshall is also the frontman of Daughters! That was a “holy shit” moment I had today.\\n\\nIn a darkly ironic sense, I can’t say I’m surprised that two creators of tortured experimental music found their time together to be horribly toxic… still incredibly unfortunate, her allegations are damning to put it lightly. Hoping she is able to heal physically and mentally and that legal recourse is pursued where applicable.\\n\\nOn a tangentially related note, was kinda expecting to see some Daughters cuts in this comments section, their sound and subject matter can get pretty twisted. Xiu Xiu too, but to that end I was happy to see Throbbing Gristle in here a couple times   \n",

Labels started hurting and musicians got the short end of the stick, and concerts were where they could actually make money (per their contracts), so they retooled the concert industry.  For a while there, every tour had to be bigger and more incredible than its predecessor.  More screens, bigger screens, more pyrotechnics, more backup dancers, bigger sets.  It was to give cover to the rising costs, make it feel like you were getting more for that ticket price.\\n\\nI went to my last stadium concert around 2010 or so.  The experience just wasn't worth the cost.  Today I am amazed anyone still does it.   \n",

       "      <td>Thank you. So many hurt men blaming women in this thread. In fact, that's most of the thread. Like obviously women are not perfect either, but can we focus on the fact that women don't orgasm at the same rate as men and will not talk about it for fear of offending men?\\n\\nProbably not because this thread showcases the fact that men get very defensive about this.</td>\n",
       "      <td>&gt;So many hurt men blaming women in this thread\\n\\nThis isn't to refute that because, well, yeah.\\n\\nBut the study shows that women withhold the exact information men would need to improve based on the woman's perception of the fragility of his manhood. Not talking about it certainly isn't the answer. I wouldn't want to have that conversation either, but there's blame on both parties here.\\n\\nWhy is your (hypothetical) partner so insecure? Can you help him with that outside of the bedroom? I think it's safe to say most men *want* help and it often feels like it's withheld like this.</td>\n",

Not talking about it certainly isn't the answer. I wouldn't want to have that conversation either, but there's blame on both parties here.\\n\\nWhy is your (hypothetical) partner so insecure? Can you help him with that outside of the bedroom? I think it's safe to say most men *want* help and it often feels like it's withheld like this.   \n",
