       " 'I do not have a background in optimization and I am trying to teach myself more about this topic. I find myself having a lot of trouble understanding the different \"types\" of optimization problems that exist.For example, I understand the idea of optimizing continuous functions (e.g. y = x\\\\^2) - for example, we could be interested in finding out the value of \"x\" that results in the smallest value of \"y\". I also understand that continuous functions can be optimized subject to some constraints.However, I find myself very confused when trying to sort through the following types of optimization problems:* **Discrete Optimization*** **Integer Optimization*** **Mixed Integer Optimization*** **Combinatorial Optimization**When I think of these problems, the first thing that comes to mind is that they are fundamentally different from optimizing continuous functions. For instance, the inputs of the above list of problems are usually \"categorial\" in nature - this is why I have heard that problems belong to the above list usually require \"gradient free optimization methods\" (e.g. evolutionary algorithms, branch and bound, etc.) , since it is impossible to take the derivatives of the objective functions corresponding to these problems.For example, if you take problems such as **\"Travelling Salesman\" or \"Knapsack Optimization\"** (note: I have heard that these problems belong on the above list, but I am not sure), I would visualize the objective function as something like this:&#x200B;&#x200B; This leads me to the following question:* Are 4 types of optimizations on the above list effectively the \"same thing\"? The way I see it, all 4 types of these problems have \"discrete inputs\" and in a mathematical sense, \"integers\" are always considered as \"discrete\". In all 4 types of problems, we are interested in finding out a \"discrete combination\" of inputs - i.e. \"combinatorial\". Thus, **are 4 types of optimizations on the above list effectively the \"same thing\"?*** I have heard the argument that \"any optimization problem that can be formulated into a linear problem is always convex (because linear objective functions are always convex)\". If we consider continuous optimization problems - we usually say that \"convex optimization problems are easier than non-convex optimization problems\" because non-convex functions can have \"saddle points\" that can result in the optimization algorithm getting stuck in these \"saddle points\". Using this logic, I have seen the objective function of the \"Travelling Salesman Problem\" being written as a linear function and thus the \"Travelling Salesman Problem\" being considered as a convex optimization problem - I have also heard of the \"Travelling Salesman Problem\" is a very difficult problem to solve. **If the \"Travelling Salesman Problem\" is convex and difficult to solve - does this imply that there are non-convex discrete/combinatorial problems that are even more difficult to solve?*** I have heard the following argument: Discrete/Combinatorial Optimization Problems are more difficult to solve compared to Continuous Optimization Problems. This is apparently because discrete/combinatorial optimization problems involve \"treating the problem as a continuous problem\" to first come up with a solution, and then determine if the solution lies within the feasible region - thus effectively solving two optimization problems in one. **Is this correct?*** Finally, I have seen both \"Travelling Salesman\" and \"Knapsack Optimization\" being formulated as a linear problem and therefore as convex. **Are there any well known examples of non-convex discrete/combinatorial optimization problems?**Thanks!',\n",

Some important snippets from it are (bold added):>Within the field of type theory, mathematical proofs and theorems are represented by functional programs and their associated types. This is called the Curry-Howard correspondence, and is the basis of modern proof assistants such as Agda, Idris, Coq and HOL/Isabelle. Sadly, those are complex software with monolithic implementations that are hard to audit and reason about. We are interested in a simpler alternative: a fully-featured proof assistant that can be turned into a small standard that is easy to analyze and implement independently.  >  >Under that perspective, one may be interested on the **Calculus of Constructions** (CoC), a small type theory that **easily fits 1000 lines of code** in a modern programming language. Sadly, that and similar languages **are not capable of deriving mathematical induction**, an important proof technique without which any non-trivial theorem is not provable. Moreover, it is not capable of expressing efficient (constant space and time) pattern-matching, without which functional programming is not viable. The usual solution to both problems is to supplement CoC with a native datatype system, but this results in the complexity explosion that is seen on the mentioned languages.The same author made this [Calculus of Constructions repo in JavaScript](-of-constructions/blob/5b4ede47dfcc408ce27903f78d29c81bf393a9d3/src/core.js), but it seems to have been replaced by KindLang.So then it is stated:>**A simple, clever alternative was proposed by** [Aaron Stump](/~astump/). With just one additional primitive, the \"**self type**\", **coupled with mutually recursive definitions, one can easily derive induction** for lambda encodings, i.e., a way to represent datatypes with native lambdas, subsuming the need for a separate implementation. This also solves the efficiency problem, as we are able to pattern-match in constant time with certain lambda encodings. The problem with that solution is that providing a semantics and, thus, proving the consistency of the resulting system becomes extremely hard.  >  >Aaron Stump **moved on from self types towards a very similar solution based on dependent intersections**. The idea is that, instead of relying on mutual recursion, inductive datatypes can refer to themselves in simplified, erased forms. This results in a comparably small language that is much easier to provide a semantics for, which Aaron Stump called Cedille-Core. In exchange, programming on it is hard. The simple task of defining a datatypes with efficient pattern-matching and recursion becomes a complex task involving non-trivial type-level manipulations and many intermediate proofs. While doable, programming in Cedille-Core without a supplementary language to do all that work for you is not practical.Then it talks about \"consistency\" being a problem when modeling, which is a bit over my head. Then:>Computationally, Formality-Core is just the lambda calculus.Meanwhile, the latest KindLang [THEOREMS](-lang/Kind/blob/master/THEOREMS.md) doc describes how to prove things. Have not read through all of that yet, though.What I am wondering is, what is the summary of the theory KindLang is built upon? What I shared above is pieced together.I found this by landing on the [Calculus of Constructions]() (CoC) after looking at the [Lambda Cube](). I found that from looking at [HoTT]() and [UniMath](), both of which are touted as \"foundations of math\". (UniMath is based on Calculus of Constructions as far as I understand). But as the above snippets show, CoC cannot model induction or recursion I guess, so I wonder how these can serve as foundations. So it looks like KindLang builds upon CoC like UniMath, but adds that \"self type\" that Aaron Stump talks about. *Does it add anything else?*I was reading about [Cubical Type Theory](-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory) (does not even have a Wikipedia page yet), but it was said it also had some key problems, and then landed on [this paper]() which states right up front:>We prove normalization for (univalent, Cartesian) cubical type theory, **closing the last major open problem** in the syntactic meta-theory of cubical type theory.*Maybe I misread that though.*So I am wondering, what theory does KindLang use, and how does it relate to Cubical Type Theory, which seems to be the latest edition of Type Theory that is the most expressive.Trying to figure out what the latest theory is for implementing a proof language like KindLang.',\n",

But we are unable to synthesize these organisms we know so much about ourselves in a lab despite knowing how to perfectly verify nearly every piece of their structure by looking at them. Translating to the P=NP problem, the “verification” of a problem can be thought of as examining every single piece of an organism and confirming that it is what we think it is. The “solving” of the problem would consist of creating such an organism from scratch, from non-living material. Despite knowing how every single piece of a multi cellular organism works and being able to verify them, humans cannot solve them by creating them in a lab. What is the only current known way to “create” life? By waiting for nature’s random iteration to try and fail over billions of years and trillions of “guess and check” iterations. If evolution can be thought of as the only way to achieve the “solution”, until we can figure out a way to synthesize complex multi cellular organisms from scratch, nature’s answer to the P=NP problem is that verifying a solution does not imply that it can be solved.

       " \"**Problem statement:**>Write a function, which creates a random graph of a certain size as follows. The function takes two parameters. The first parameter is the number of vertices n. The second parameter p (1 >= p >= 0) is the probability that an edge exists between a pair of nodes. In particular, after instantiating a graph with n vertices and 0 edges, go over all possible vertex pairs one by one, and for each such pair, put an edge between the vertices with probability p. The graph representation is an adjacency matrix.**Proposed algorithm:**    1- Create a bool matrix (2d nested array) of size n*n initialized with false.    2- Run a loop over the rows:      - Run an inner loop over the columns:        - if row_index != col_index do:            - curr_p = random() // random() returns a number between 0 and 1 inclusive            - if curr_p <= p: set matrix[row_index][col_index] = true              - For an undirected graph, also set matrix[col_index][row_index] = true        **Note:**    Since we are setting both cells (both directions) in the matrix    in case of a probability hit, we could potentially set an edge 2 times.    This does not corrupt the correctnes of the probability    and is not much additional work. It helps to keep the code clean.        If you want to optimize this solution, you could run the loop    such that you only visit the lower-left triangle (excluding the diagonal)    and just mirror the results you get for those cells to the upper-right triangle.Now, someone told me that without the optimization the algorithm is wrong since it calculates the propability of edge existence twice.  In their words:>With the current code in the undirected case, the probability that matrix\\\\[0\\\\]\\\\[1\\\\] will be set is the probability that the random number in the iteration with col=0/row=1 or in the iteration with col=1/row=0 is smaller than p. That probability is 1-(1-p)\\\\^2.&#x200B;At first I thought they were right, but thinking more about it it occured to me that since the random number generations are independent of each other and since we do not need 2 false (or 2 trues) to set or unset an edge, the probability calculation of the algorithm is correct. If their argument was correct, it would be like saying when you throw a 6 on a 6 sided dice, your chances of getting a 6 next time are less than 1/6. In other words, it looks like the [Gambler's fallacy]('s_fallacy) on their part.&#x200B;I hope I have managed to convey the problem and arguments in full.

       " \"&#x200B;🔵 Singular Value Decomposition 🔵\\U0001fa84 Remember from the [post on eigenvectors](/): eigenvectors of a matrix are special vectors that only get scaled when the matrix is applied to them. While EVD (eigenvalue decomposition) can only be applied to special matrices (diagonalizable matrices) SVD is a generalization of EVD and can be applied to any rectangular matrix.🧩 Like prime factorization where a number is broken down to its prime factors (simpler pieces = prime numbers in this case); SVD factorizes the matrix into simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices. This factorization or decomposition comes in handy for many applications some of which I briefly touch upon later.🏥🦴 Time for (somewhat of) an analogy: You can think of SVD as an x-ray of a matrix. It provides us with simpler pieces that constitute the matrix and by looking at these simpler pieces i.e. simpler matrices we can say a lot about the matrix in question. Things like its (pseudo-) inverse, rank, null-space, range among other things can be easily determined the same way a doctor can say a lot with an x-ray scan of your body.🔨 The Singular Value decomposition breaks the original matrix into 3 pieces: 2 unitary matrices and a rectangular diagonal matrix. You can draw a parallel with the Eigenvalue decomposition equation and see exactly how SVD has a more general form.🔄 With the help of the Singular Value decomposition we can explain what happens to an arbitrary vector when a matrix M is applied to it. Since M can be broken down into simpler pieces, we can represent the matrix M by a rotation, followed by scaling (by the singular values) and another rotation. So if you had a circle it would first be rotated then stretched by the singular values (becoming an ellipse) and finally be rotated to end up as a rotated ellipse.🗜️ There are numerous applications of SVD. Perhaps you could comment on the ones that I missed but you know about. One of the nicest things you can get is the pseudo-inverse of a matrix without doing crazy matrix inversion. This is because the simple pieces that SVD provides are extremely easy to invert making inversion of the original matrix child's play. SVD is heavily applied in solving numerical problems such as solving linear equations that so frequently pop up in engineering.🎥 Data compression and computing low-rank approximations make it handy for compressing images and videos so you can watch cat videos without buffering. And of course, SVD has also been used for ranking web pages like Google's Pagerank algorithm does so you can find your favorite recipe with a quick search.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

These signals are always looking for data to transfer via the bus to read, but they are essentially always running (this is the part I am shaky on I think) - when you write and compile a program say hello world, you have organized some high level code into what can be translated into machine code and binary. When you executed this is sent to the ram, where the clock frequency (always looking) activates logic gates based on what was sent, and tells you what the output it.- if you wanted to use an embedded controller to run a motor the same applies where the programmer writes readable code which can be converted to binary, and is sent to the pinouts in such a way that causes some actuation to happen (such as alternate pulses to a stepper motor) Am I on the right track here ?

The y-intercept should be 2 in my sketch.]()🔵 Gradient descent 🔵💾 A more detailed post this time but I wanted to make sure I touch upon some basics first before diving into gradient descent itself. This is mainly so that it is more inclusive and no one feels left behind if they have missed what gradient is and if you already know what it is you get to brush up on the concept.🏃 Although a relatively simple optimization algorithm, gradient descent (and its variants) has found an irreplaceable place in the heart of machine learning. This is majorly due to the fact that it has shown itself to be quite handy when optimizing deep neural networks and other models. The models behind the latest advances in ML and computer vision are majorly optimized using gradient descent and its variants like Adam and gradient descent with momentum.⛰️ The gradient of a function is a vector that points to the direction of the steepest ascent. The length or the magnitude of this vector gives you the rate of this increase.🔦 Time for an analogy: it is nightfall and you are on top of a hill and want to get to the village down low in the valley. Fortunately, you have a trusty flashlight that helps you see the steepest direction locally around you despite the darkness. You take each step in the direction of the steepest descent using the flashlight and reach the village at the bottom fairly quickly.📐 Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the parameters of a function. It uses 3 critical pieces of information: your current position (x\\\\_i), the direction in which you want to step (gradient of f at x\\\\_i), and the size of your step.🧗The gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent but because we need to minimize we reverse the direction by multiplication with -1.🎮 This toy example illustrates how gradient descent works in practice. We compute the gradient of the function that needs to be optimized i.e. the differentiation of the function with respect to the parameters. This gradient gives us the information we need about the landscape of the function i.e. the steepest direction where we should move in order to minimize the function. A point to keep in mind: gamma the step size (also called the learning rate) is a hyperparameter.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

       " '&#x200B;🔵 Parametric and non-parametric statistics 🔵  🧑\\u200d💻 If you have written code before you have heard of a parameter. It is what a function takes as input to do some computation on and return an output. Similarly, probability distributions have parameters. These define the properties of the distribution.  🔔 In the case of a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are its parameters. The mean controls the position of the distribution while the standard deviation controls the spread or \"peakiness\" of the bell curve.  ⛷️ In the parametric approach, the model consists of a finite set of parameters that characterize it. The big assumption that a parametric model makes is that the model will do well on the task if the underlying distribution from which your data is sampled matches the model. If that is not the case the model and data mismatch will hurt the performance on the task you care about.  🤸 A non-parametric model does not rely on parametric assumptions and is generally more flexible. It is a good choice if you do not have any prior knowledge about what could be a good model that reflects your data distribution. A histogram is a good example that can model points sampled from an arbitrary distribution.  🧐 However, there is no free lunch: you will need enough data points to get a good approximation otherwise the histogram will look nothing like the underlying distribution.  \\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you like such content and would like to steer the topics I cover, feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments.',\n",

       " \"&#x200B;🔵 k-means Clustering 🔵🔱 The k-means algorithm divides N data points into K disjoint clusters. It is a well-known unsupervised learning model. This means that the k-means algorithm only requires the data points and does not need the corresponding cluster that each point belongs to as this is what the algorithm figures out.✨ The clusters are found by allocating points in such a way that the total variance of the points within each cluster (intra-cluster variance) is reduced or minimized. Although it iterates quite fast, the k-means algorithm can have varying cluster formations based on the initialization. It has been widely implemented in many software packages. The scikit-learn package for python is the one that I have used most often.🔁 The most common method to perform the clustering is iterative. It alternates between two steps: (1) assigning each point to a cluster based on the point's closeness (or distance) to the cluster center and (2) updating the cluster center (called mean or centroid; hence the name k-means one for each of the k clusters) based on all the points that belong to this particular cluster. The iterations are usually performed until the centroids stabilize (converge) between consecutive iterations.🤓 K-means is popular in scenarios where the data is known to consist of multiple groups (distributions) but it is unknown which point belongs to which group (cluster). It can be used for data analysis and splitting data that comes from multiple distributions, image segmentation, color quantization among other things.\\\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been studying and practicing Machine Learning and Computer Vision for 7+ years.

       " 'When, say, in C++, we say `void* ptr = &my_var`, we set ptr equal to the memory location of my\\\\_var.  Okay.  But where does this memory location number come from, and why/how do we actually access it?  Say we have our memory as 5000 bytes of data, in 1D.  My understanding is that each byte in memory has its own address, but I do not understand the mechanism for how.   I understand that it is like a \"house address\" and we need it in order to find a value stored at a given location.  But at the most basic level, where are these addresses coming from? The hardware? Or is this just something we are adding to that byte of memory (sort of like metadata in Numpy arrays)? If that is the case, then does this not take up some of the memory? E.g. we have a memory location of 13413241 let us say.  Where is this value stored? I would assume that all the memory locations, all these integers, are inherent to the computer we are working on, and thus always exist.  Is this entirely separate from \"memory\" in terms of how big our program is (if they always exist anyways)?  It just seems like we can pull these memory addresses out of thin air.  If I define say `x = 5`, is it always the case that I have also implicitly defined `some_pointer = &x`, and is this now in my program\\'s \"memory\"?   Unless the memory location is not \"bundled\" to that 5, I do not see how the pointer \"knows\" the memory location.  Maybe all of this is happening at the hardware level and I am too focused on the software level.  I have not found any articles that explain what I am looking for, only what a pointer is.  Maybe this is more of a question about what the `*` and `&` operators are actually doing.It might be evident already, but I almost exclusively use Python.  In Python, we can define a variable, which will always be equal to some object, and then we can set that variable equal to other things, namely we are just telling that variable to now \"point\" at a new object: but the previous object still exists in memory, it just is not referenced.

It is special in the sense that after applying the said transform it does not change direction but only gets scaled (multiplied by a scalar value) by the eigenvalue.🔨 Each eigenvector comes with a corresponding scalar called the eigenvalue. Breaking a matrix M into its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is called eigendecomposition.🔭 The word \"Eigenvector\" comes from \"eigen\" in German where it means \"its own\". It was originally used to study rigid body motion and in the discovery of principal axes. However, nowadays it has found its way into a wide array of applications from my favorite: principal component analysis, differential equations, and problems in physics and chemistry relating to wave transport and molecular orbitals.🎭 Another one of the classical applications is the Eigenfaces project for facial recognition. Eigenfaces decompose a face as a composition of face templates (basis) called eigenfaces. Imagine N eigenfaces E\\\\_1, ..., E\\\\_n when given a new face F it can be written as a composition of each of these N eigenfaces for example: F = (10% of E\\\\_1 + 55% of E\\\\_2 + 35% of E\\\\_3).

I can simply change the value of `age` directly because I have access to it as I am changing from the same scope.A reason I could think of for creating a pointer to a variable in the same scope is that it might be useful to have pointers point to a variable in the same scope because it would make the naming easy and referencing to the value in huge codebases would be made easier, but I do not think that this is a good use case. The main purpose of pointers is to stop the wastage of memory by copying of the values stored in a variable to another variable but if we are creating pointers, we are of course storing them in a variable which is taking memory so we are back to square one. This might not be the case where variables store a lot of data, this is true for variables that store less data than the memory address itself.My question is that is there any use for creating pointers that point to variables in the same scope or they are never used like that.

The OS then looks at the IP:Port# and if there is a connected socket listening with that IP and Port, it then (through the socket library) passes the data to the process that is the \"server\".

And so the contravariance of the subtypes methods is precisely because it is trying to preserve the provability of the subtype relationship.My apologies, I know that is probably a lot of the same words.[Code](+184%2C+195%2C+1%29&t=vscode&wt=none&l=text%2Fx-php&ds=true&dsyoff=42px&dsblur=68px&wc=true&wa=true&pv=56px&ph=56px&ln=false&fl=1&fm=Hack&fs=14px&lh=133%25&si=false&es=2x&wm=false&code=class%2520Speaker%2520%257B%250A%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520%2524word%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520LoudSpeaker%2520extends%2520Speaker%2520%257B%250A%2520%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520strtoupper%28%2524word%29%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520ScreamingSpeaker%2520extends%2520LoudSpeaker%2520%257B%250A%2520%2509public%2520function%2520speak%28string%2520%2524word%29%2520%257B%250A%2509%2509return%2520strtoupper%28%2524word%29%2520.%2520%27%21%21%21%27%253B%250A%2509%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520Animal%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520public%2520function%2520speak%28LoudSpeaker%2520%2524speaker%29%253A%2520string%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520return%2520%2524speaker-%253Espeak%28self%253A%253Aclass%29%253B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Aclass%2520Cat%2520extends%2520Animal%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520Why%2520am%2520I%2520not%2520allowed%2520to%2520accept%2520ScreamingSpeaker%2520here%253F%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520According%2520to%2520LSP%2520I%2520can%2520only%2520accept%2520either%2520LoudSpeaker%2520or%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520it%27s%2520parent%2520class%2520Speaker.%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520public%2520function%2520speak%28LoudSpeaker%2520%2524speaker%29%253A%2520string%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520return%2520%2524speaker-%253Espeak%28self%253A%253Aclass%29%253B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250A%250Afunction%2520makeAnimalSpeak%28Animal%2520%2524animal%29%2520%257B%250A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%252F%252F%2520According%2520to%2520LSP%2520I%2520shouldn%27t%2520pass%2520in%2520LoudSpeaker%2520here%253F%250A%2509return%2520%2524animal-%253Espeak%28new%2520Speaker%29%253B%250A%257D%250A%250AmakeAnimalSpeak%28new%2520Cat%29)\",\n",

       " 'Hi all, I have recently been looking a bit into networking and trying to understand it a bit more but routing tables have me a bit stuck. I think that I understand how they work by I do not have the faintest idea why.So as I understand it, a packet comes into a router and the destination IP address is AND’ed with each of the subnet masks in the table and the result of each of these is compared with the destination IP address of each entry in the table. If there are any matches between the result of this AND calculation and destination IP addresses then the packet is forwarded to this destination. If there are no matches the packet goes to the default destination and if there is more than one matches then the packet goes to the destination with the highest subnet mask.My question is, why does this work? How does this form of selecting destinations make sure packets make it to their destination. How does this stop data packets going round in circles and taking ages to make it to their destination.I hope that I have been clear, but please let me know if I should clarify anything.Thank you so much for any help here :)',\n",

For example, if there is a 100mb file, instead of writing the 100mb to both drives simultaneously, why does not it write 50MB (different halves of the data) at the same time, and then virtually treat it as one complete file as it then continues to write the full file on both drives in the background after done? Does writing 1 bit take up 1 bit of potential reading or something? Even then, the background writing can resume after reading is done at a later time if that is the reason. The only downside I see to this is that you risk losing that particular file if one drive fails before the completed write takes place, but that seems like a minor sacrifice for the improved performance.',\n",

First of all, I am sorry if this post can be a little bit confusing, I am trying to gather all I have understood so far to make it as clear as possible.So, I am attending a Logical Networks class, and we started some days ago talking about sequential circuits. Today, our professor introduced us to synchronous and asynchronous circuits, but not in the same way I found online.He introduced them by saying this:Basically an asynchronous circuit is a circuit that whatever the state and the input (q1,I) you consider, will always end up in a steady state (qn, I), where if you keep I as an input you will keep staying in the qn state.And, contrary to this, he told us that synchronous circuits are circuits where not all states and inputs have this property.So what does that specifically mean? I struggle to understand the concept, as some of the example he gave us for synchronous circuits (one of them was a machine that was able to recognise if there was a 101 sequence in the input) seemed to have the steady state property I talked about before, so I think I might be missing something.That said, he then explained us that for that reason (not every state with an input I will end up in a steady state) we need an external synching (a clock) and a memory to make a state steady. Why is that? And why do not we need that for asynchronous circuits?Lastly, he talked about how some of these machines need just an impulse or a longer signal to work (and for example an asynchronous machine cannot recognise a '00' input as it operates when an input changes, so it can only tell that the last input was a (for example) 1 and this one is a 0). How do you tell that? Hope this was clear, thank you for everyone who chooses to spend their time to help me understand :)Oh and, do not take my words for something so accurate of what our professor told us, since I am trying to rephrase these things from what i have understood.\",\n",

Programming languages do not matter much. The core concepts of programming matter a lot more than programming languages but still a lot of people want to learn more and more programming languages. Senior software engineers know this that programming languages do not matter as you can learn a programming language thoroughly well in a night if you know the concepts well. By concepts I mean all the things that are applied while making a product(e.g. a web app), if you know compiler design, it would be incredibly easy to grasp a language, that is where concepts pay off.This problem\\'s because is bad platforms and bootcamps but I would not name them.

I digress, but it was to illustrate I have somewhat of an idea of what I am doing.The reset signal from the register is sent indicates the end of the loop.As for the initialization, the load signal indicates to replace the state of S. In other words, initialize S.So, to recap:The register does the following ( slight over simplification):1. CLK = State Change2. LD = Initializes3. Reset = Control\",\n",

This lack of having a pre-defined nature is the heart of the claim because, though artificial intelligence (hereafter “A.I.”) can be self-aware, it cannot be self-defined.In the modified Turing test, there are two (2) apparent Turing tests taking place in two separate rooms. Finally, there is a third room that will be explained at the end. In the first room, a typical Turing test is run. This means there are two humans and a computer in the first room. The “investigator” human asks the questions and receives the answers, thus, we can generate two transcripts that have identical questions and are only different in their answers. This is standard. In the second room, there are two computers and one human. The “investigator” is itself a computer that has already passed the standard Turing test. Thus, in this second room, it is the computer program that is actually serving the role of trying to distinguish between the answers of a computer and human. Again, we can receive two transcripts of the Q & A.The human investigator and the A.I. investigator In both of the first two rooms must be provided sufficient time for their questions and interactions with the computer and the human that they will end up judging. They must feel satisfied that they can make an intelligent guess in their own Turing test attempts. Finally, in the third room, we have our real investigator, This investigator will compare the four (4) transcripts and judge which of the two rooms had a human questioner and which of the two rooms had a computer program questioner. Thus, the true object of the examination is to see whether a computer program could match a human in asking the questions in a Turing test as opposed to answering them. Assuming a large enough amount of data, i.e., sufficient questioning and a long enough time given for the “interview process,” I do not believe a computer program can be designed that could pass this modified Turing test. My hypothesis is that because the “investigator” side of the traditional Turing test will be filled with questions that will make it apparent that a human is doing the asking. Importantly, the human investigator and the computer investigator in the first two rooms must NOT know that they are actually the subsections of the third room test. This means that the A.I. Investigator (who already passed the traditional Turing test) will now know that it should be trying to imitate a human.The point of the modified Turing test proposal, in summation, is to show that the A.I that passed the Turing test can only do so when it is, knowingly, the object of the study. Providing the second layer into the experiment would turn the A.I. into the apparent “studier” and, yet, unbeknownst to the computer, still actually the object of the study.This proposed modified Turing test will allow for a better barrier to defining humanity from computer programs should the hypothesis hold true that artificial intelligence will not be able to pass this modified version of the Traditional Turing test.Please feel free to consider how this modified Turing test would work should the experiment ever take place.',\n",

Stack Overflow is one of the most popular Q&A websites about programming, where millions of developers seek help or provide valuable assistance. Activity on the Stack Overflow website is moderated by the user community, utilizing a voting system to promote high quality content. The website was created on 2008 and has accumulated a large amount of crowd wisdom about the software development industry. Here we analyse this data to examine trends in the grouping of technologies and their users into different subcommunities. In our work we analysed all questions, answers, votes and tags from Stack Overflow between 2008 and 2020. We generated a series of user-technology interaction graphs and applied community detection algorithms to identify the biggest user communities for each year, to examine which technologies those communities incorporate, how they are interconnected and how they evolve through time. The biggest and most persistent commu-nities were related to web development. In general, there is little movement between communities; users tend to either stay within the same community or not acquire any score at all. Community evolution reveals the popularity of different programming languages and frameworks on Stack Overflow over time. These findings give insight into the user community on Stack Overflow and reveal long-term trends on the software development industry.',\n",

This question stems from confusion on two Crash Course YouTube video.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟 𝗤𝗨𝗘𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡:I am confused by two crash course videos. In the first video they created the RAM using 8 256-bit memory modules (16 latches x 16 latches). So an 8 bit number can be broken up into one bit in each memory module allowing for 256 memory addresses for 256 bytes.In the second video they break the 8 bit number at an address into 4 bits for an opcode and the other 4 bits for an address. They reduced the number of addresses to 16 which makes sense since 4 bits can only produce 16 numbers.This is why I am asking how it would work if you wanted 256 addresses. If you still want 16 instructions you would still need a 4-bit opcode, but would not you also need 8 more bits for the 256 addresses bringing your data at each address to 12 bits?

The bakery had several cashiers, but if more than one person approached a single cashier at the same time, that cashier would try to talk to all of them at once and become confused. Lamport realized that there needed to be some way to guarantee that people approached cashiers one at a time.* *This problem reminded Lamport of an issue which has been posed in an earlier article by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra on another mundane issue: how to share dinner utensils around a dining table. One of the coordination challenges was to guarantee that each utensil was used by at most one diner at a time, which came to be generalized as the* ***mutual exclusion*** *problem, exactly the challenge Lamport faced at the bakery.**One morning in 1974, an idea came to Lamport on how the bakery customers could solve mutual exclusion among themselves, without relying on the bakery for help. It worked roughly like this: people choose numbers when they enter the bakery, and then get served at the cashier according to their number ordering. To choose a number, a customer asks for the number of everyone around her and chooses a number higher than all the others.**This simple idea became an elegant algorithm for solving the mutual exclusion problem without requiring any lower-level indivisible operations. It also was a rich source of future ideas,* *since many issues had to be worked out. For example, some bakery customers took a long time to check other numbers, and meanwhile more customers arrived and selected additional numbers. Another time, the manager of the bakery wanted to get a snapshot of all the customer numbers in order to prepare enough pastries.* *Lamport later said \"For a couple of years after my discovery of the bakery algorithm, everything I learned about concurrency came from studying it.\"**The Bakery Algorithm and Lamport\\'s other pioneering works -- many with amusing names and associated parables -- have become pillars of computer science. His collection forms the foundation of broad areas in concurrency, and has influenced the specification, development, and verification of concurrent systems.*Key headings summarising his work:**1.

       " 'I am going to be referring to the problem as its framed in this video: [\\\\_MtS\\\\_w4]().My problem with it is twofold: one, its an entirely immaterial program, and arguably does not \\'do\\' anything (in a sense, it cannot be run--not cannot finish, it cannot even *begin*), and two, it violates the laws of physics. Nobody was ever expecting a general solution to physically impossible or instubstantive programs, and for that reason I find the halting problem entirely vacuous.Its very similar to the following \\'contradiction\\':1. Statement 2 is a lie.2. Statement 1 is true.Many people have seen a problem like this before, and its relevantly similar to how the halting problem is laid out. If you accept statement 1, then that implies statement 2 is false about 1 being true, meaning you have contradicted your initial assumption. If you assume statement 1 is false, then that means statement 2 is true, which means statement 1 is true, so which contradictions the initial assumption.My problem with this \\'contradiction\\' is that its entirely insubstantive. It does not bottom out in the real world anywhere, and I am not convinced the problem can exist anywhere other than pure linguistic pedantics.To demonstrate this, see a similar problem:1. Statement 2 is true.2. Statement 1 is true.Here is the question: how do you evaluate these two statements? Are they both true? If you assume statement 1 is true, then that means statement 2 is true, which confirms your assumption, no contradictions. So they are true then? But wait, you can do the same by assuming they are false. If statement 1 is false, then statement 2 is false, meaning statement 1 is false, just like your initial assumption.Technically you can do it with just one statement, to make it more like the halting problem:1. Statement 1 is true.So there is absolutely no way to evaluate these statements. My argument is this: \\'truth\\' does not make sense unless you bottom out in the real world somewhere. Truth, accuracy, correctness, all it really means is that there is a 1 to 1 correlation between a representation and reality, but there *is no reality being represented by these insubstantive statements.* It leads to an infinite regress, which is why its unsolvable--you have to know the truth of statement 1 to know the truth of 2, and you have to know the truth of 2 to know the truth of 1.The contradictory version is the same--also leading to an infinite regress of insubstantive questioning, we just do not notice because we get caught up in the contradiction.Notice how a series of statements that bottom out somewhere substantive can be solved:1. Statement 2 is true.2. Statement 3 is true.3. Statement 6 is true.4. Statement 5 is true.5. Statement 6 is true.6. Statement 9 is true.7. Statement 8 is true.8. Statement 10 is true.9. Statement 10 is true.10. I ate eggs for breakfast this morning.This time, we *can evaluate the statements*, no matter how long it is. This is because we bottom out at something we can empirically evaluate, and then derive the truth value of the other second-order statements (statements about other statements). But when a set of propositions contains *only second order statements that do not refer to anything except each other, you cannot evaluate it.* But if you break the infinitely regressing cycle with a substantive statement, the problem disappears. No matter how long the series of meta-statements goes, as long as they bottom out somewhere substantive, you can solve it.This is relevantly similar to the halting problem, because in the same way that we are evaluating the truth of an insubstantive statement, we are also evaluating the haltability of an insubstantive program. In order for the program to be run, we would have to know the results of the program, which depend on the results of the program, which depend on the results of the program... ad infinitum. It only becomes a problem because we have made up a completely meaningless and immaterial thing. How would such a program even *start*? Where would it get the inputs? In the same way that circular sets of statements cannot begin evaluation, this program cannot begin to run.That is not to say that someone could not *attempt* to write such a program. Only that they would fail. The program they generate would be a real thing that exists in the actual world, but it would never be relevantly similar to H+ (as described in the video). To demonstrate, let us try it, and showing why it cannot be done will be illuminating.Suppose you created a Python program that looks like this (ignore boolean/string conversions for the moment):    # read output from file    outcome_file = open(\"outcome.txt\",\"a\")    outcome = output_file.readlines()        # flip the sign    if outcome == True:         outcome = False    elif outcome == False:        outcome = True:        # write to file    outcome_file.write(outcome)Also stipulate that the only program capable of creating the outcome.txt file is this program. No other program or user has done so. What will happen? The program will crash immediately if there is no pre-made outcome.txt file (which you cannot do, because the program needs to be evaluating the outcome of something it itself generated).Why did the program crash? Well, you might say its because I made a mistake, but think about what would be required not to: the outcome.txt file in the second line would have to be ***THE EXACT SAME*** both in contents and time as in the one in the last line. You would literally have to go backwards in time to send the outcome of the program to itself in order for it to run. Turing is correct that this program cannot be evaluated, but only because its the kind of thing that violates the laws of physics.Some people might continue to object: \"That is exactly what Turing was getting at!\", but that is a sleight of hand--the question was not whether *H+* can exist, its whether *H* can exist. Sure, we have shown that the program does not work when its own output is required to run it, turning it into H+, but that is only because H+ contradicts the laws of physics. H+ may fail to exist, but that does not demonstrate that H cannot exist, any more than saying \"you cannot run H on a computer that is in the shape of a square circle\" demonstrates that H cannot exist. When you artificially construct a contradiction in the scenario, its not a sign of the other entity being flawed, its a sign of the scenario being flawed.So brilliant. If you know a Python library that can send booleans back in time or perform other logical contradictions, then perhaps this will have practical significance to you. For those of us that want to evaluate real programs that can exist, the halting problem is not meaningful.',\n",

       " 'Hey everyone, So I have been thoroughly and religiously studying Compilers for a couple of months now. In addition, to the Dragon Book, I have been taking video lectures and exploring through slides online that have been compiled (no pun intended) by people that have worked with the compiler technology for years. So anyway, I have familiarized myself with all the basics (Scanning, Parsing (including generating parse trees and ASTs), and even code generation, as well). I have a good understanding of the complex algorithms involved in some of these stages, and I have a good intuition on the complexity involved in all this (in particular, I understand what problems are undecidable for a programmer. What are the pros and cons of different techniques and so on). So anyway, one of the lecture series that I watched had taken upon \"Engineering a Compiler\" as their reference book, and I have explored some portion of this book (of course, I am still at the very beginning), and my initial thoughts are: \\\\- This book comes across as very beginner-friendly \\\\- I like how it builds from the basics. So, for example, while constructing a scanner, we get to see the application of finite-state automata in action. So the book tells us how to go from a regular expression to non-deterministic finite automata using Thompson\\'s construction algorithm and how all this process leads us to recognize words. We get to learn about this process within the first 50 pages of the book. In contrast to this, the dragon book jumps straight into the more complex stuff (such as writing context-free grammar, building a syntax-directed translator, and some other notions from a parsing point of view). In other words, it seems to skip a lot of stuff at the beginning that should have been introduced before we had jumped into the more complex stuff. \\\\- As mentioned above, \"Engineering a Compiler\" takes a very programming-oriented approach. It is easier to comprehend things from a coding point of view, and it is convenient to map the theory into actual practice.\\\\- The notion of \"Classic Expression Grammar\" is introduced in a very beginner-friendly manner in that book. Anyways, I am still in the process of learning and exploring as much as I can, so I am not sure how much weight and value my opinion carries. I am reading up on both texts. In my opinion, the Dragon Book is very detailed, in the sense that each sentence can be a book on its own at times, but \"Engineering a compiler\" seems more beginner-friendly. One more thing that I have heard people say is that some of the optimization techniques presented in the dragon book are a bit outdated, but I am still looking forward to reading about that.

Taking from that above concept, being able to create a blockchain that run in a LAN environment for the most part is easy, as getting access to the IP of a device over a local network is pretty simple and sending data between the two is straightforward. For the most part, online tutorials can show how that can work. What I do not understand is how to create or convert an existing blockchain that runs in a LAN environment to one that can accept nodes from outside a local network? How do you make a blockchain be accessible globally, and not just accessible within a local wifi network? How exactly does that initial connection get established to a given blockchain and what happens when that new node needs to be\\xa0 indoctrinated? I have been looking all around to find information that talks more deeply about the actual communication between nodes and how the actual network layer works, but I have come across very little.

I understand why a compiling to a (bytecode) VM makes sense. A good example here is the Another World game from the 90s where the creator compiled it to its own VM and you “only” needed to port the VM in order to run it.However, all the “custom” languages I am reading in the books are general purpose. Just like the commercial VMs like JVM etc. But, I can imagine there being very specific use cases that can warrant a specialized language and VM. E.g. a 2D game engine might benefit a lot by specialized routines for managing a lot of entities or rendering pixels to screen etc. I can imagine if the language, compiler and VM are built for a specific use case a lot of assumptions can be made compile time.Are there any examples in the real world of this?

Long ago, I myself worked on a similar game in the past, called \"[InfeCCt]()\", which is based on paper puzzle books used for cognitive training. We were given the puzzles, but no insights into their MATLAB-based generator, or its runtime characteristics.The \"magic\" of the dataset used for InfeCCt was that *most puzzles were quite hard, yet at the same time compact and had only one solution*. The sweet spot was somewhere at 1 to 3 solutions, while maintaining many false choices. Given the sheer number of puzzles they had, and the limited available computing power, they did something much, much more efficient than just testing a lot of cases. In fact, others ripped off the InfeCCt game - and ended up copying the puzzles, or merely mirroring them as obfuscation. Which leads me to my...# Question: What are efficient approaches to generate \"nice\" example cases for this problem?My research mostly yields me better algorithms to solve the problem, but for me, formulating and selecting the problem from a vast number of possible puzzle board configurations is hard. I have seen a few Hamilton path [generators](/), and am currently picking these apart; but they care more about the intersection of the path rather than missing (inaccessible) vertices of the graph.My initial approach was to randomly generate puzzles, check how many Hamilton Paths exists (e.g. naïve backtracking, parallelized across cores), and grade the puzzle on their length and number of choices. This requires searching the entire problem space, which - given the problem - is not very efficient. In fact, outputting higher order puzzles quickly slows to a crawl. I also experimented with pre-determined shapes and cutting these out of a trivial graph.I currently test finding the first solution in a depth first search, and counting the number of decisions on the way, discarding anything that has too many decisions (e.g. an empty chess board has a gargantuan number of choices for a rook to travel and visit all the squares, but many trivial solutions are immediately obvious)Worse, some problems with exactly 1 path are extremely hard (and often intuitively does not look like it), and some with 1 path are trivial (think a maze with no forks or intersections). For the former, the search could be extremely hard for whatever algorithm I use, but easy for humans who will use heuristic search, and occasionally even vice versa (but this is beyond the scope of my question, and goes into my ultimate goal of researching cognitive and neurological effects on people learning to solve these puzzles).Thank you for your input, I greatly appreciate any ideas or pointers where to look.',\n",

This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF' hacking comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive hacking. Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease.

In short, the mechanics ideally want to choose cars that they think will be both :\\\\- Easy to work on (i.e. require fewer hours)\\\\- Pay them well (e.g. suppose the mechanics are paid 50% of the total price the customer pays)The only problem is: the mechanics have no idea how much time any given car will require for repair (let us assume that no one knows this information exactly), nor do they know the amount of money the customers were charged (e.g. let us assume that the owner of the repair shop and the owner of the car negotiate the price in private). When making a decision on which cars to work on, the mechanics only have access to the following information:\\\\- Total Mileage each car has driven\\\\- Price that the customer originally purchased the car forHowever, the mechanics have access to historical data. The mechanics have a dataset that contains all 4 of these variables - for all cars that all mechanics at this shop have serviced since the shop has opened, they have: Total Mileage, Original Price of Car, Number of Hours that were required (can consider this as a \"supervised label\"), Total Bill that the customer was charged (can consider this as a \"supervised label\").On first glance, this problem sort of looks like the \"Knapsack Optimization Problem\" ([\\\\_problem]()) - however, in the \"Knapsack Problem\", we know in advance the \"value and cost\" (i.e. the \"labels\") of each potential item we would like to consider for the knapsack. In this car mechanic problem, we do not know the \"labels\" - information that will eventually be used for defining/calculating the costs and utility function.**Question:** Can the mechanics train two separate supervised models (e.g. regression, random forest) on the data that they have, e.g.Model 1: hours\\\\_car\\\\_requires = f(mileage, original\\\\_price)Model 2 : total\\\\_bill = g(mileage, original\\\\_price)Then, if these models are able to perform well on the training data - they can then use them to predict the \"total bill\" and the \"hours required\" for each new car that comes to the repair shop. From here, they could then turn this problem into a \"multi objective optimization task\" and use optimization algorithms to select cars to work on?Can someone please tell me if this approach that I have described makes sense? Or are there already well established algorithms designed for these kinds of problems? My analogy was that on some abstract level, the mechanics selecting desirable cars to work is the same as choosing portfolios with low risk and high return.Thanks',\n",

These are often called request/reply services. At Amazon, when we think about building a distributed system, the hard real-time system is the first type that we think of. Unfortunately, hard real-time distributed systems are the most difficult to get right.

Examples include front-end web servers, the order pipeline, credit card transactions, every AWS API, telephony, and so on. Hard real-time distributed systems are the major focus of this article.\"&#x200B;That goes against my previous understanding of what \"hard real-time\" meant.

Such strong guarantees are required of systems for which not reacting in a certain interval of time would because great loss in some manner, especially damaging the surroundings physically or threatening human lives (although the strict definition is simply that missing the deadline constitutes failure of the system)\"&#x200B;I would not consider a front-end web server to be a \"great loss\" in the same sense as some of the other examples in the wikipedia article (car engine control system for example).
